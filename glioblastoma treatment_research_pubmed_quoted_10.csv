"""Molecular Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance in Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and is almost invariably fatal. Despite our growing understanding of the various mechanisms underlying treatment failure, the standard-of-care therapy has not changed over the last two decades, signifying a great unmet need. The challenges of treating glioblastoma are many and include inadequate drug or agent delivery across the blood-brain barrier, abundant intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, redundant signaling pathways, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we review the innate and adaptive molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma's treatment resistance, emphasizing the intrinsic challenges therapeutic interventions must overcome-namely, the blood-brain barrier, tumoral heterogeneity, and microenvironment-and the mechanisms of resistance to conventional treatments, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33396284
"""Revolutionizing Glioblastoma Treatment: A Comprehensive Overview of Modern Therapeutic Approaches.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in the adult population, with an average survival of 12.1 to 14.6 months. The standard treatment, combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, is not as efficient as we would like. However, the current possibilities are no longer limited to the standard therapies due to rapid advancements in biotechnology. New methods enable a more precise approach by targeting individual cells and antigens to overcome cancer. For the treatment of glioblastoma, these are gamma knife therapy, proton beam therapy, tumor-treating fields, EGFR and VEGF inhibitors, multiple RTKs inhibitors, and PI3K pathway inhibitors. In addition, the increasing understanding of the role of the immune system in tumorigenesis and the ability to identify tumor-specific antigens helped to develop immunotherapies targeting GBM and immune cells, including CAR-T, CAR-NK cells, dendritic cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Each of the described methods has its advantages and disadvantages and faces problems, such as the inefficient crossing of the blood-brain barrier, various neurological and systemic side effects, and the escape mechanism of the tumor. This work aims to present the current modern treatments of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38891962
"""Recurrent Glioblastoma-Molecular Underpinnings and Evolving Treatment Paradigms.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal central nervous system malignancy with a median survival after progression of only 6-9 months. Major biochemical mechanisms implicated in glioblastoma recurrence include aberrant molecular pathways, a recurrence-inducing tumor microenvironment, and epigenetic modifications. Contemporary standard-of-care (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor treating fields) helps to control the primary tumor but rarely prevents relapse. Cytoreductive treatment such as surgery has shown benefits in recurrent glioblastoma; however, its use remains controversial. Several innovative treatments are emerging for recurrent glioblastoma, including checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, oncolytic virotherapy, nanoparticle delivery, laser interstitial thermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy. This review seeks to provide readers with an overview of (1) recent discoveries in the molecular basis of recurrence; (2) the role of surgery in treating recurrence; and (3) novel treatment paradigms emerging for recurrent glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38928445
"""Glioblastoma multiforme: Pathogenesis and treatment.""","""Each year, about 5-6 cases out of 100,000 people are diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumors, of which about 80% are malignant gliomas (MGs). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) accounts for more than half of MG cases. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite current multimodality treatment efforts including maximal surgical resection if feasible, followed by a combination of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the median survival is short: only about 15months. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors has presented opportunities for newer therapies to evolve and an expectation of better control of this disease. Lately, efforts have been made to investigate tumor resistance, which results from complex alternate signaling pathways, the existence of glioma stem-cells, the influence of the blood-brain barrier as well as the expression of 0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. In this paper, we review up-to-date information on MGs treatment including current approaches, novel drug-delivering strategies, molecular targeted agents and immunomodulative treatments, and discuss future treatment perspectives.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25944528
"""Glioblastoma and Other Primary Brain Malignancies in Adults: A Review.""","""Importance: Malignant primary brain tumors cause more than 15 000 deaths per year in the United States. The annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals and increases with age. Five-year survival is approximately 36%. Observations: Approximately 49% of malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas, and 30% are diffusely infiltrating lower-grade gliomas. Other malignant brain tumors include primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (7%) and malignant forms of ependymomas (3%) and meningiomas (2%). Symptoms of malignant brain tumors include headache (50%), seizures (20%-50%), neurocognitive impairment (30%-40%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%-40%). Magnetic resonance imaging before and after a gadolinium-based contrast agent is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating brain tumors. Diagnosis requires tumor biopsy with consideration of histopathological and molecular characteristics. Treatment varies by tumor type and often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. For patients with glioblastoma, the combination of temozolomide with radiotherapy improved survival when compared with radiotherapy alone (2-year survival, 27.2% vs 10.9%; 5-year survival, 9.8% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.7]; P < .001). In patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q codeletion, probable 20-year overall survival following radiotherapy without vs with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine was 13.6% vs 37.1% (80 patients; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.35-1.03]; P = .06) in the EORTC 26951 trial and 14.9% vs 37% in the RTOG 9402 trial (125 patients; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40-0.94]; P = .02). Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma includes high-dose methotrexate-containing regimens, followed by consolidation therapy with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimens, or whole brain radiation. Conclusions and relevance: The incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals, and approximately 49% of primary malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas. Most patients die from progressive disease. First-line therapy for glioblastoma is surgery followed by radiation and the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318
"""Medicinal Plants for Glioblastoma Treatment.""","""Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, demonstrates the least life expectancy among all brain cancers. Because of the regulation of diverse signaling pathways in cancers, the chemotherapeutic approaches used to suppress their multiplication and spread are restricted. Sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents has been developed because of the pathological and drug-evading abilities of these diverse mechanisms. As a result, the identification and exploration of strategies or treatments, which can overcome such refractory obstacles to improve glioblastoma response to treatment as well as recovery, is essential. Medicinal herbs contain a wide variety of bioactive compounds, which could trigger aggressive brain cancers, regulate their anti-cancer mechanisms and immune responses to assist in cancer elimination, and cause cell death. Numerous tumor-causing proteins, which facilitate invasion as well as metastasis of cancer, tolerance of chemotherapies, and angiogenesis, are also inhibited by these phytochemicals. Such herbs remain valuable for glioblastoma prevention and its incidence by effectively being used as anti-glioma therapies. This review thus presents the latest findings on medicinal plants using which the extracts or bioactive components are being used against glioblastoma, their mechanism of functioning, pharmacological description, and recent clinical studies conducted on them.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939551
"""Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541850
"""Focused ultrasound for the treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Six years ago, in 2015, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation sponsored a workshop to discuss, and subsequently transition the landscape, of focused ultrasound as a new therapy for treating glioblastoma. Methods: This year, in 2021, a second workshop was held to review progress made in the field. Discussion topics included blood-brain barrier opening, thermal and nonthermal tumor ablation, immunotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, and desired focused ultrasound device improvements. Results: The outcome of the 2021 workshop was the creation of a new roadmap to address knowledge gaps and reduce the time it takes for focused ultrasound to become part of the treatment armamentarium and reach clinical adoption for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma. Priority projects identified in the roadmap include determining a well-defined algorithm to confirm and quantify drug delivery following blood-brain barrier opening, identifying a focused ultrasound-specific microbubble, exploring the role of focused ultrasound for liquid biopsy in glioblastoma, and making device modifications that better support clinical needs. Conclusion: This article reviews the key preclinical and clinical updates from the workshop, outlines next steps to research, and provides relevant references for focused ultrasound in the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35267132
"""Overcoming the blood-brain tumor barrier for effective glioblastoma treatment.""","""Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Particularly in adult patients, the vast majority of gliomas belongs to the heterogeneous group of diffuse gliomas, i.e. glial tumors characterized by diffuse infiltrative growth in the preexistent brain tissue. Unfortunately, glioblastoma, the most aggressive (WHO grade IV) diffuse glioma is also by far the most frequent one. After standard treatment, the 2-year overall survival of glioblastoma patients is approximately only 25%. Advanced knowledge in the molecular pathology underlying malignant transformation has offered new handles and better treatments for several cancer types. Unfortunately, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients have not yet profited as although numerous experimental drugs have been tested in clinical trials, all failed miserably. This grim prognosis for GBM is at least partly due to the lack of successful drug delivery across the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The human brain comprises over 100 billion capillaries with a total length of 400 miles, a total surface area of 20 m(2) and a median inter-capillary distance of about 50 μm, making it the best perfused organ in the body. The BBTB encompasses existing and newly formed blood vessels that contribute to the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor and facilitate glioma cell migration to other parts of the brain. The high metabolic demands of high-grade glioma create hypoxic areas that trigger increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels and a dysfunctional BBTB. Even though the BBTB is considered 'leaky' in the core part of glioblastomas, in large parts of glioblastomas and, even more so, in lower grade diffuse gliomas the BBTB more closely resembles the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents efficient passage of cancer therapeutics, including small molecules and antibodies. Thus, many drugs can still be blocked from reaching the many infiltrative glioblastoma cells that demonstrate 'within-organ-metastasis' away from the core part to brain areas displaying a more organized and less leaky BBTB. Hence, drug delivery in glioblastoma deserves explicit attention as otherwise new experimental therapies will continue to fail. In the current review we highlight different aspects of the BBTB in glioma patients and preclinical models and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of drug delivery approaches for the treatment of glioma patients. We provide an overview on methods to overcome the BBTB, including osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), bradykinin receptor-mediated BBTB opening, inhibition of multidrug efflux transporters, receptor-mediated transport systems and physiological circumvention of the BBTB. While our knowledge about the molecular biology of glioma cells is rapidly expanding and is, to some extent, already assisting us in the design of tumor-tailored therapeutics, we are still struggling to develop modalities to expose the entire tumor to such therapeutics at pharmacologically meaningful quantities. Therefore, we must expand our knowledge about the fundamentals of the BBTB as a step toward the design of practical and safe devices and approaches for enhanced drug delivery into the diseased brain area.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25791797
"""Novel Therapies in Glioblastoma Treatment: Review of Glioblastoma; Current Treatment Options; and Novel Oncolytic Viral Therapies.""","""One of the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors is glioblastoma (GB). About 6 incidents per 100,000 people are reported annually. Most frequently, these tumors are linked to a poor prognosis and poor quality of life. There has been little advancement in the treatment of GB. In recent years, some innovative medicines have been tested for the treatment of newly diagnosed cases of GB and recurrent cases of GB. Surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy are all common treatments for GB. A few of the potential alternatives include immunotherapy, tumor-treating fields (TTFs), and medications that target specific cellular receptors. To provide new multimodal therapies that focus on the molecular pathways implicated in tumor initiation and progression in GB, novel medications, delivery technologies, and immunotherapy approaches are being researched. Of these, oncolytic viruses (OVs) are among the most recent. Coupling OVs with certain modern treatment approaches may have significant benefits for GB patients. Here, we discuss several OVs and how they work in conjunction with other therapies, as well as virotherapy for GB. The study was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. A total of 307 articles were found in a search on oncolytic viral therapies for glioblastoma. Out of these 83 articles were meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, reviews, and systematic reviews. A total of 42 articles were from the years 2018 to 2023. Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used in this article. One of the most prevalent malignant brain tumors is still GB. Significant promise and opportunity exist for oncolytic viruses in the treatment of GB and in boosting immune response. Making the most of OVs in the treatment of GB requires careful consideration and evaluation of a number of its application factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38249077
"""A state-of-the-art liposome technology for glioblastoma treatment.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a challenging problem due to the poor BBB permeability of cancer drugs, its recurrence after the treatment, and high malignancy and is difficult to treat with the currently available therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the prognosis and survival rate of GBM are still poor after surgical removal via conventional combination therapy. Owing to the existence of the formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the aggressive, infiltrating nature of GBM growth, the diagnosis and treatment of GBM are quite challenging. Recently, liposomes and their derivatives have emerged as super cargos for the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma because of their advantages, such as biocompatibility, long circulation, and ease of physical and chemical modification, which facilitate the capability of targeting specific sites, circumvention of BBB transport restrictions, and amplification of the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we provide a timely update on the burgeoning liposome-based drug delivery systems and potential challenges in these fields for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Furthermore, we focus on the most recent liposome-based drug delivery cargos, including pH-sensitive, temperature-sensitive, and biomimetic liposomes, to enhance the multimodality in imaging and therapeutics of glioblastoma. Furthermore, we highlight the future difficulties and directions for the research and clinical translation of liposome-based drug delivery. Hopefully, this review will trigger the interest of researchers to expedite the development of liposome cargos and even their clinical translation for improving the prognosis of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37937394
"""Glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas: a clinical review.""","""Importance: Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. Objective: To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications. Evidence review: Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system. Findings: Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis. Conclusions and relevance: Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193082
"""Investigational treatment strategies in glioblastoma: progress made and barriers to success.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype (IDHwt), remains an incurable disease despite considerable research effort. The current standard of care since 2005 comprises maximal safe resection followed by radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide; more recently, the addition of tumor treating fields was approved in the newly diagnosed and recurrent disease settings. Areas covered: Searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov provided a foundation for this review. We first describe early research including carmustine wafers, brachytherapy, anti-angiogenesis, and immune checkpoint inhibition for glioblastoma. Next, we discuss challenges precluding the translation of preclinical successes. This is followed by a description of promising treatments such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy as well as the recent qualified successes of cancer vaccinations. Non-immunotherapy trials are also highlighted, and ongoing or pending phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are codified in study tables. Expert opinion: Unfortunately, hundreds of trials, including of agents effective in systemic malignancy, have not drastically changed management of glioblastoma. This may reflect unique resistance mechanisms and highlights a need for multimodality treatments beyond surgery, radiation, and conventional chemotherapy. Novel techniques, such as those in the emerging field of cancer neuroscience, may help uncover tolerable and effective regimens for this lethal malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37796104
"""Recent Developments in Glioblastoma Therapy: Oncolytic Viruses and Emerging Future Strategies.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. Standard treatment protocols and traditional immunotherapy are poorly effective as they do not significantly increase the long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) may be an effective alternative approach. Combining OVs with some modern treatment options may also provide significant benefits for glioblastoma patients. Here we review virotherapy for glioblastomas and describe several OVs and their combination with other therapies. The personalized use of OVs and their combination with other treatment options would become a significant area of research aiming to develop the most effective treatment regimens for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851761
"""Exosomes: Their role in the diagnosis, progression, metastasis, and treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Exosomes are crucial for the growth and spread of glioblastomas, an aggressive form of brain cancer. These tiny vesicles play a crucial role in the activation of signaling pathways and intercellular communication. They can also transfer a variety of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor to recipient cells. Exosomes can influence the immune response by regulating the activity of immune cells, and they are crucial for the growth and metastasis of glioblastoma cells. In addition, exosomes contribute to drug resistance during treatment, which is a major obstacle in the treatment of glioblastoma. By studying them, the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma can be improved. Due to their high biocompatibility and lack of toxicity, they have become an attractive option for drug delivery. The development of exosomes as carriers of specific therapeutic agents could overcome some of the obstacles to effective treatment of glioblastoma. In this review, we address the potential of exosomes for the treatment of glioblastoma and show how they can be modified for this purpose.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806071
"""Treatment of Glioblastoma in Older Adults.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor diagnosed in the USA and is associated with a poor prognosis. The outcomes in elderly patients (more than 65 years of age) are worse when compared to those younger than age 65 at the time of diagnosis. Older patients are not always offered treatments that would otherwise be considered standard of care due to comorbidities and concerns about toxicity and tolerability. The initial European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study that led to approval of temozolomide in glioblastoma excluded patients more than 70 years of age. This review outlines challenges that arise in the treatment of glioblastoma in the elderly population and discusses results of recent studies that established the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to radiation and surgery. There is evidence that these patients can benefit from a more aggressive and safe resection, from hypofractionated radiation treatments, and from adjuvant temozolomide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29075865

Immunotherapy, which predominantly focuses on peptide vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and oncolytic virotherapy, have achieved some promising results in both preclinical and clinical trials. The future of immune therapy for GBM requires an integrated effort with rational combinations of vaccine therapy, cell therapy, and radio- and chemotherapy as well as molecule therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33767690
"""A comprehensive profile of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""In spite of relentless efforts to devise new treatment strategies, primary glioblastomas invariably recur as aggressive, therapy-resistant relapses and patients rapidly succumb to these tumors. Many therapeutic agents are first tested in clinical trials involving recurrent glioblastomas. Remarkably, however, fundamental knowledge on the biology of recurrent glioblastoma is just slowly emerging. Here, we review current knowledge on recurrent glioblastoma and ask whether and how therapies change intra-tumor heterogeneity, molecular traits and growth pattern of glioblastoma, and to which extent this information can be exploited for therapeutic decision-making. We conclude that the ability to characterize and predict therapy-induced changes in recurrent glioblastoma will determine, whether, one day, glioblastoma can be contained in a state of chronic disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041580
"""Glioblastoma stem cells: lessons from the tumor hierarchy in a lethal cancer.""","""Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of all human cancers. Glioblastomas display striking cellular heterogeneity, with stem-like glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex. Although the original identification of GSCs dates back more than a decade, the purification and characterization of GSCs remains challenging. Despite these challenges, the evidence that GSCs play important roles in tumor growth and response to therapy has grown. Like normal stem cells, GSCs are functionally defined and distinguished from their differentiated tumor progeny at core transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulatory levels, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality will be universally effective against a heterogenous GSC population. Glioblastomas induce a systemic immunosuppression with mixed responses to oncoimmunologic modalities, suggesting the potential for augmentation of response with a deeper consideration of GSCs. Unfortunately, the GSC literature has been complicated by frequent use of inferior cell lines and a lack of proper functional analyses. Collectively, glioblastoma offers a reliable cancer to study cancer stem cells to better model the human disease and inform improved biologic understanding and design of novel therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160393

Although traditionally limited to systemic malignancies (melanoma, lung and colon cancer), the field of immunotherapy has recently identified glioblastoma as a potential target for new treatments. Anti-tumor vaccines (dendritic cell/heat shock), checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric T-cell receptors, and virotherapy all have been preliminarily trialed in glioblastoma patients with reasonable success and safety.

Material and methods: The ESTRO Guidelines Committee identified 14 European experts in close interaction with the ESTRO clinical committee and EANO who discussed and analysed the body of evidence concerning contemporary glioblastoma target delineation, then took part in a two-step modified Delphi process to address open questions. Results: Several key issues were identified and are discussed including i) pre-treatment steps and immobilisation, ii) target delineation and the use of standard and novel imaging techniques, and iii) technical aspects of treatment including planning techniques and fractionation. Based on the EORTC recommendation focusing on the resection cavity and residual enhancing regions on T1-sequences with the addition of a reduced 15 mm margin, special situations are presented with corresponding potential adaptations depending on the specific clinical situation. Conclusions: The EORTC consensus recommends a single clinical target volume definition based on postoperative contrast-enhanced T1 abnormalities, using isotropic margins without the need to cone down. A PTV margin based on the individual mask system and IGRT procedures available is advised; this should usually be no greater than 3 mm when using IGRT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059335

Current standard of care includes surgery and chemoradiation. Synthetic pharmacotherapies continue to be explored as potential therapeutic options for glioblastoma patients.Areas covered: This study reviews synthetic pharmacotherapies that are currently under investigation in phase I-III clinical trials. The authors of this study highlight the mechanisms of action of the synthetic pharmacotherapy agents under investigation, outline the available evidence for their utility based on the literature, and summarize the current landscape.Expert opinion: Although warranting further investigation, the studies generally highlighted here have not shown remarkable changes in clinical benefits beyond what has already been established with radiochemotherapy. As we develop more synthetics, we will likely need to combine them with other synthetics to target multiple separate molecular pathways.

"""Relapsed Glioblastoma: Treatment Strategies for Initial and Subsequent Recurrences.""","""At the time of glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence, a sharp analysis of prognostic factors, disease characteristics, response to adjuvant treatment, and clinical conditions should be performed. A prognostic assessment could allow a careful selection between patients that could be proposed to intensified approaches or palliative setting. Participation in clinical trials aims to improve outcome, and should be encouraged due to dismal prognosis of GBM patients after recurrence. Reoperation should be proposed if the tumor is amenable to a complete resection and if prognostic factors suggest that patient could benefit from a second surgery. Second-line chemotherapy should be chosen based on MGMT status, time to disease recurrence, and toxicity profile. If enrollment into a clinical trial is not possible, a nitrosourea-based regimen is the preferred choice, carefully evaluating any previous temozolomide (TMZ)-related toxicity. In MGMT-methylated patients relapsing after TMZ completion, a rechallenge could be proposed. After second progression, the clinical advantage of subsequent lines of chemotherapy still needs to be clarified. However, based on performance status, patients' preference, and disease behavior, a third-line treatment could be considered. Available treatments include nitrosoureas, bevacizumab, or carboplatin plus etoposide. However, more effective therapeutic options are needed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27461038
"""Challenges in the Treatment of Glioblastoma: Multisystem Mechanisms of Therapeutic Resistance.""","""Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal human cancers, with poor survival despite surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Advances in the treatment of this type of brain tumor are limited because of several resistance mechanisms. Such mechanisms involve limited drug entry into the central nervous system compartment by the blood-brain barrier and by actions of the normal brain to counteract tumor-targeting medications. In addition, the vast heterogeneity in glioblastoma contributes to significant therapeutic resistance by preventing adequate control of the entire tumor mass by a single drug and by facilitating escape mechanisms from targeted agents. The stem cell-like characteristics of glioblastoma promote resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy through upregulation of efflux transporters, promotion of glioblastoma stem cell proliferation in neurogenic zones, and immune suppression, respectively. Metabolic cascades in glioblastoma prevent effective treatments through the optimization of glucose use, the use of alternative nutrient precursors for energy production, and the induction of hypoxia to enhance tumor growth. In the era of precision medicine, an assortment of molecular techniques is being developed to target an individual's unique tumor, with the hope that this personalized strategy will bypass therapeutic resistance.

It is notorious for its extremely low (~5%) 5-year survival rate which signals the unsatisfactory results of the standard protocol for GB therapy. This issue has become, over time, the impetus for the discipline of bringing novel therapeutics to the surface and challenging them so they can be improved. The cell-based approach in treating GB found its way to clinical trials thanks to a marvelous number of preclinical studies that probed various types of cells aiming to combat GB and increase the survival rate. In this review, we aimed to summarize and discuss the up-to-date preclinical studies that utilized stem cells or immune cells to treat GB. Likewise, we tried to summarize the most recent clinical trials using both cell categories to treat or prevent recurrence of GB in patients. As with any other therapeutics, cell-based therapy in GB is still hampered by many drawbacks. Therefore, we highlighted several novel techniques, such as the use of biomaterials, scaffolds, nanoparticles, or cells in the 3D context that may depict a promising future when combined with the cell-based approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35011678

Regardless of the problems in clinical development, the rationale for the application of anti-angiogenics in glioblastoma remains.Areas covered: Resistance to anti-angiogenics is discussed, including vessel co-option and amplification of hypoxic signaling in response to vessel destruction. The modulation of GSC and tumor-associated macrophages by dysfunctional tumor vessels and by hypoxia are outlined. Pharmacologic approaches to sensitizing glioblastomas to anti-angiogenics and evidence for the cooperation of anti-angiogenics with immunotherapies are summarized.

The better understanding of vascular co-option and adverse effects of blood vessel destruction guides to improve strategies for vascular targeting. The pivotal role of the vasculature and of angiogenic factors such as VEGF for the induction and maintenance of immunosuppression in glioblastoma supports the use of anti-angiogenics in combination with immunotherapy.

Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) are emerging treatment modalities for glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the methodology and feasibility to combine BNCT and CIRT treatments. The combined treatment plan illustrated how the synergistic utilization of BNCT's biological targeting and CIRT's intensity modulation capabilities could lead to optimized treatment outcomes.Approach. The Monte Carlo toolkit, TOPAS, was employed to calculate the dose distribution for BNCT, while matRad was utilized for the optimization of CIRT. The biological effect-based approach, instead of the dose-based approach, was adopted to develop the combined BNCT-CIRT treatment plans for six patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, considering the different radiosensitivity and fraction. Five optional combined treatment plans with specific BNCT effect proportions for each patient were evaluated to identify the optimal treatment that minimizes damage on normal tissue.Main results. Individual BNCT exhibits a significant effect gradient along with the beam direction in the large tumor, while combined BNCT-CIRT treatments can achieve uniform effect delivery within the clinical target volume (CTV) through the effect filling with reversed gradient by the CIRT part. In addition, the increasing BNCT effect proportion in combined treatments can reduce damage in the normal brain tissue near the CTV. Besides, the combined treatments effectively minimize damage to the skin compared to individual BNCT treatments.Significance. The initial endeavor to combine BNCT and CIRT treatment plans is achieved by the effect-based optimization.

GBM treatment is mainly based on the maximal surgical resection and radiotherapy associated to chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used in chemotherapy protocols for GBM treatment in order to improve immunotherapy and antiangiogenic processes. High specificity and affinity of mAbs for biological targets make them highly used for brain tumor therapy. Specifically, antiangiogenic mAbs have been wisely indicated in chemotherapy protocols because GBM is the most vascularized tumors in humans with high expression of cytokines. However, mAb-based therapy is not that effective due to the aggressive spread of the tumor associated to the difficulty in the access of mAb into the brain (due to the blood-brain barrier). For that reason, nanobiotechnology has played an important role in the treatment of several tumors, mainly in the tumors of difficult access, such as GBM.

Despite aggressive multimodal therapy, consisting mostly of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy, tumors nearly always recur close to the site of resection. For the past 15 years, very little progress has been made with regards to improving patient survival. Although immunotherapy represents an attractive therapy modality due to the promising pre-clinical results observed, many of these potential immunotherapeutic approaches fail during clinical trials, and to date no immunotherapeutic treatments for GBM have been approved. As for many other difficult to treat cancers, GBM combines a lack of immunogenicity with few mutations and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unfortunately, both tumor and immune cells have been shown to contribute towards this immunosuppressive phenotype. In addition, current therapeutics also exacerbate this immunosuppression which might explain the failure of immunotherapy-based clinical trials in the GBM setting. Understanding how these mechanisms interact with one another, as well as how one can increase the anti-tumor immune response by addressing local immunosuppression will lead to better clinical results for immune-based therapeutics. Improving therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier also presents a challenge for immunotherapy and future therapies will need to consider this.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multimodal treatment on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in ML glioblastoma. Methods: Patients presenting with CNS WHO grade 4 glioblastoma with ML to 2 major German Departments of Neurosurgery between January 1st, 2008, to December 31st, 2020 were included in this study. Primary outcome parameters were extent of resection (EOR) using the 2021 RANO criteria, progression free- and overall survival. Results: A total of 483 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (CNS WHO grade 4) were assessed. 134 patients presented with ML (72 multifocal (MF), 62 multicentric (MC)). The median PFS and OS did not differ among MC and MF glioblastomas. The EOR was a significant predictor of PFS and OS in ML glioblastoma. complete-, near total-, and subtotal resection significantly prolonged PFS (p < 0.0001) and OS (p < 0.0001) compared to biopsy alone. Standard radiotherapy (p = 0.045) and hypofractionated (p < 0.0001) radiotherapy and adjuvant treatment (Stupp protocol) prolonged PFS (p = 0.0012) and OS (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis Karnfosky performance score, EOR, and concomitant adjuvant treatment remained significant factors influencing OS. Propensity score matching of patients with ML and solitary lesion tumors showed similar PFS and OS (p = 0.08).

The number of immunotherapy approaches to fight glioblastoma is growing. Here, we review the recent progress in four main areas: dendritic cell immunotherapy, peptide vaccination, chimeric antigen receptors and immune checkpoints. Recent findings: We and others are using dendritic cells to present glioblastoma antigens (whole tumor lysate) to the immune system; our initial data indicate that clinical benefit is associated to increased presence of natural killer cells in the periphery. A pilot study loading dendritic cells with glioblastoma stem-like cells will start soon. Peptide vaccination targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) epitope, present in 25% of glioblastomas, is ongoing. Intriguing results have been obtained by vaccination with three other peptides in pediatric gliomas. Another clinical trial is targeting EGFRvIII by adoptive cell transfer of chimeric antigen receptor. This exciting technology could be suited for a number of other potential epitopes discovered through next-generation sequencing. Finally, antibodies against the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1, which demonstrated efficacy in advanced melanomas, will be used in novel trials for recurrent glioblastoma.

Age and dexamethasone administration in glioblastoma patients have been hypothesized to limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy, but their effects remain unclear. We compared peripheral blood immune composition in patients with different types of brain tumor to determine the influence of age, dexamethasone treatment, and tumor volume. Methods: High-dimensional mass cytometry was used to characterise peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 169 patients with glioblastoma, lower grade astrocytoma, metastases and meningioma. We used blood from medically-refractory epilepsy patients and healthy controls as control groups. Immune phenotyping was performed using FlowSOM and t-SNE analysis in R followed by supervised annotation of the resulting clusters. We conducted multiple linear regression analysis between intracranial pathology and cell type abundance, corrected for clinical variables. We tested correlations between cell type abundance and survival with Cox-regression analyses. Results: Glioblastoma patients had significantly fewer naive CD4+ T cells, but higher percentages of mature NK cells than controls. Decreases of naive CD8+ T cells and alternative monocytes and an increase of memory B cells in glioblastoma patients were influenced by age and dexamethasone treatment, and only memory B cells by tumor volume. Progression free survival was associated with percentages of CD4+ regulatory T cells and double negative T cells. Conclusion: High-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood in patients with different types of intracranial tumor provides insight into the relation between intracranial pathology and peripheral immune status.

A second is to use a radiosensitizer to enhance the radiotherapy effect on CSCs. A third is to use immune cells to attack the CSCs. In a fourth method, an agent is used to promote CSCs to differentiate into normal cells. Finally, ongoing gene therapy may be helpful. New therapeutic agents for targeting a signal pathway, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) or protein kinase inhibitors, have been used for GBM but for CSCs the effects still require further evaluation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitors have proven to be effective for increasing radiation sensitivity of CSCs in culture.

Treatments for glioblastoma are similar to standard therapies for many other cancers and do not effectively prolong the survival of patients, due to the unique location and heterogeneous characteristics of glioblastoma. Immunotherapy has shown a promising effect for many other tumors, but its application for glioma still has some challenges. The recent breakthrough of high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) systems has allowed researchers to update their strategy for identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in a much shorter time with lesser effort. The protein maps can contribute to generating a complete map of regulatory systems to elucidate tumor mechanisms. In particular, newly developed unicellular proteomics could be used to determine the microenvironment and heterogeneity. In addition, a large scale of differentiated proteins provides more ways to precisely classify tumor subtypes and construct a larger library for biomarkers and biotargets, especially for immunotherapy. A series of advanced proteomic studies have been devoted to the different aspects of immunotherapy for glioma, including monoclonal antibodies, oncolytic viruses, dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.

This poor prognosis has lead scientists to seek alternative molecular approaches for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Among these, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, and immunotherapy are all approaches that are currently being investigated. While these molecular approaches may not herald an immediate change in the prognosis of these aggressive tumors, combining them with existing approaches may bring some progress in the standard of care. This paper reviews current treatments and several newer therapies in preclinical and early clinical studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18473496
"""Understanding the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment: leveraging the extracellular matrix to increase immunotherapy efficacy.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for approximately half of all malignant brain tumors, and it remains lethal with a five-year survival of less than 10%. Despite the immense advancements in the field, it has managed to evade even the most promising therapeutics: immunotherapies. The main reason is the highly spatiotemporally heterogeneous and immunosuppressive GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). Accounting for this complex interplay of TME-driven immunosuppression is key to developing effective therapeutics. This review will explore the immunomodulatory role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by establishing its contribution to the TME as a key mediator of immune responses in GBM. This relationship will help us elucidate therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to develop and deliver more effective immunotherapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38380331
"""Prognostic differences and implications on treatment strategies between butterfly glioblastoma and glioblastoma with unilateral corpus callosum infiltration.""","""Approximately 25% of glioblastomas show at diagnosis a corpus callosum infiltration, which is associated with poor prognosis. The extent of corpus callosum involvement, however, ranges from partial unilateral to complete bilateral infiltration. The role of surgery in glioblastoma with corpus callosum involvement is controversial. In this study, we aimed to examine prognostic differences between glioblastoma with unilateral and glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration, and to evaluate possible treatment strategy implications. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from 2010 to 2019 were included. Corpus callosum infiltration was assessed in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Extent of resection, adjuvant treatments and overall survival were evaluated. Corpus callosum involvement was found in 96 (26.4%) out of 363 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Bilateral corpus callosum infiltration was found in 27 out of 96 patients (28%), and 69 patients had unilateral corpus callosum infiltration. Glioblastoma with corpus callosum affection had significantly lower median overall survival compared to glioblastoma without corpus callosum involvement (9 vs. 11 months, p = 0.02). A subgroup analysis of glioblastoma with unilateral corpus callosum infiltration revealed a significant difference in median overall survival dependent on extent of resection (6.5 without gross total resection vs. 11 months with gross total resection, Log-rank test p = 0.02). Our data confirms a shorter overall survival in glioblastoma subpopulation with corpus callosum involvement, especially for glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration. However, patients with partial corpus callosum infiltration undergoing gross total resection exhibited a significant survival benefit compared to their counterparts without gross total resection. Whenever reasonably achievable gross total resection should be considered as an integral part of the treatment strategy in glioblastoma with partial corpus callosum infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357498
"""Antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed glioblastoma: analysis of single-agent and combined modality approaches.""","""Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma can prolong survival, but it is not curative. For patients with disease progression after frontline therapy, there is no standard of care, although further surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy may be used. Antiangiogenic therapies may be appropriate for treating glioblastomas because angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth. In a large, noncomparative phase II trial, bevacizumab was evaluated alone and with irinotecan in patients with recurrent glioblastoma; combination treatment was associated with an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 50.3%, a median overall survival of 8.9 months, and a response rate of 37.8%. Single-agent bevacizumab also exceeded the predetermined threshold of activity for salvage chemotherapy (6-month PFS rate, 15%), achieving a 6-month PFS rate of 42.6% (p < 0.0001). On the basis of these results and those from another phase II trial, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of single-agent bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma that has progressed following prior therapy. Potential antiangiogenic agents-such as cilengitide and XL184-also show evidence of single-agent activity in recurrent glioblastoma. Moreover, the use of antiangiogenic agents with radiation at disease progression may improve the therapeutic ratio of single-modality approaches. Overall, these agents appear to be well tolerated, with adverse event profiles similar to those reported in studies of other solid tumors. Further research is needed to determine the role of antiangiogenic therapy in frontline treatment and to identify the optimal schedule and partnering agents for use in combination therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214925

In this review, the authors discuss the unique applications of intraarterial (IA) delivery of OVs, starting with concepts of OV, how they apply to IA delivery, and concluding with discussion of the current ongoing trials. Several OVs have been used in the treatment of GBM, including specifically several modified adenoviruses. IA delivery of OVs has been performed in the hepatic circulation and is now being studied in the cerebral circulation to help enhance delivery and specificity. There are some interesting synergies with immunotherapy and IA delivery of OVs. Some of the shortcomings are discussed, specifically the systemic response to OVs and feasibility of treatment.

"""Comparison of peripheral leukocyte parameters in patients receiving conventionally and hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Treatment for glioblastomas, aggressive and nearly uniformly fatal brain tumors, provide limited long-term success. Immunosuppression by myeloid cells in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation are believed to contribute to this treatment resistance. Standard multi-modality therapy includes conventionally fractionated radiotherapy over 6 weeks; however, hypofractionated radiotherapy over 3 weeks or less may be appropriate for older patients or populations with poor performance status. Lymphocyte concentration changes have been reported in patients with glioblastoma; however, monocytes are likely a key cell type contributing to immunosuppression in glioblastoma. Peripheral monocyte concentration changes in patients receiving commonly employed radiation fractionation schemes are unknown. Methods: To determine the effect of conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated radiotherapy on complete blood cell leukocyte parameters, retrospective longitudinal concentrations were compared prior to, during, and following standard chemoradiation treatment. Results: This study is the first to report increased monocyte concentrations and decreased lymphocyte concentrations in patients treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy compared to hypofractionated radiotherapy. Discussion: Understanding the impact of fractionation on peripheral blood leukocytes is important to inform selection of dose fractionation schemes for patients receiving radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38022656
"""Current Advances in Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose of review: This review seeks to inform oncology clinicians and researchers about the development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of glioblastoma. An enumeration of ongoing and recently completed clinical trials will be discussed with special attention given to current technologies implemented to overcome central nervous system-specific challenges including barriers to the peripheral immune system, impaired antigen presentation, and T cell dysfunction. Recent findings: The success of immunotherapy in other solid cancers has served as a catalyst to explore its application in glioblastoma, which has limited response to other treatments. Recent developments include multi-antigen vaccines that seek to overcome the heterogeneity of glioblastoma, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which could amplify the adaptive immune response and may have promise in combinatorial approaches. Additionally, oncolytic and retroviruses have opened the door to a plethora of combinatorial approaches aiming to leverage their immunogenicity and/or ability to carry therapeutic transgenes. Treatment of glioblastoma remains a serious challenge both with regard to immune-based as well as other therapeutic strategies. The disease has proven to be highly resistant to treatment due to a combination of tumor heterogeneity, adaptive expansion of resistant cellular subclones, evasion of immune surveillance, and manipulation of various signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and immune response. Immunotherapeutics that are efficacious in other cancer types have unfortunately not enjoyed the same success in glioblastoma, illustrating the challenging and complex nature of this disease and demonstrating the need for development of multimodal treatment regimens utilizing the synergistic qualities of immune-mediated therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33496872

Gliadel) is a polymer wafer containing carmustine. These wafers are designed to be placed in the surgical cavity after glioblastoma resection to deliver local chemotherapy. This treatment is intended for tumors for which gross total resection is possible. Temozolomide is administered concomitantly with radiotherapy for six weeks followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (EORTC 26981, also known as 'Stupp's protocol'). Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. The two-year survival rate was 26.5% with radiotherapy plus temozolomide compared with 10.4% with radiotherapy alone. In patients with complete resection, two-year survival reached 38%.

"""Transferrin-Targeted Liposomes in Glioblastoma Therapy: A Review.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, and its treatment is further complicated by the high selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The scientific community is urgently seeking innovative and effective therapeutic solutions. Liposomes are a promising new tool that has shown potential in addressing the limitations of chemotherapy, such as poor bioavailability and toxicity to healthy cells. However, passive targeting strategies based solely on the physicochemical properties of liposomes have proven ineffective due to a lack of tissue specificity. Accordingly, the upregulation of transferrin receptors (TfRs) in brain tissue has led to the development of TfR-targeted anticancer therapeutics. Currently, one of the most widely adopted methods for improving drug delivery in the treatment of GBM and other neurological disorders is the utilization of active targeting strategies that specifically target this receptor. In this review, we discuss the role of Tf-conjugated liposomes in GBM therapy and present some recent studies investigating the drug delivery efficiency of Tf-liposomes; in addition, we address some challenges currently facing this approach to treatment and present some potential improvement possibilities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37686065
"""Viral Control of Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a universally lethal cancer of the central nervous system. Patients with GBM have a median survival of 14 months and a 5-year survival of less than 5%, a grim statistic that has remained unchanged over the last 50 years. GBM is intransigent for a variety of reasons. The immune system has a difficult time mounting a response against glioblastomas because they reside in the brain (an immunologically dampened compartment) and generate few neoantigens relative to other cancers. Glioblastomas inhabit the brain like sand in the grass and display a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, impeding efforts to therapeutically target a single pathway. Of all potential therapeutic strategies to date, virotherapy offers the greatest chance of counteracting each of the obstacles mounted by GBM. Virotherapy can xenogenize a tumor that is deft at behaving like 'self', triggering adaptive immune recognition in an otherwise immunologically quiet compartment. Viruses can also directly lyse tumor cells, creating damage and further stimulating secondary immune reactions that are detrimental to tumor growth. In this review, we summarize the basic immune mechanisms underpinning GBM immune evasion and the recent successes achieved using virotherapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34209584

Unfortunately, increasing age is one of the most important negative prognostic factors in gliomas. However, the previous nihilistic approach is progressively changing towards more active strategies. Particularly, prospective randomized studies have recently established the benefit of radiotherapy associated with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy by temozolomide in older patients with good functional status suffering from malignant gliomas. Chemotherapy alone may even be useful in this population, especially in patients with poor functional status. Symptomatic treatments such as corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs may be less tolerated in this population compared to younger patients and should be used only if needed. Initial performance status, quality of life and concomitant pathologies are obviously important factors to consider before treatment onset. The willingness of the patient and his caregivers will also be the key of the therapeutic decision. In the future, it will be necessary to develop specific schedules of treatment in this population.

This review summarizes the current status of precision oncology in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults with a median survival below 2 years. Targeted treatments without prior target verification have consistently failed. Patients with BRAF V600E-mutated GBM benefit from BRAF/MEK-inhibition, whereas targeting EGFR alterations was unsuccessful due to poor tumor penetration, tumor cell heterogeneity, and pathway redundancies. Systematic screening for actionable molecular alterations resulted in low rates (< 10%) of targeted treatments. Efficacy was observed in one-third and currently appears to be limited to BRAF-, VEGFR-, and mTOR-directed treatments. Advancing precision oncology for GBM requires consideration of pathways instead of single alterations, new trial concepts enabling rapid and adaptive drug evaluation, a focus on drugs with sufficient bioavailability in the CNS, and the extension of target discovery and validation to the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell networks, and their interaction with immune cells and neurons.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38899374
"""Glioblastoma: changing expectations?""","""Glioblastoma (GB) represents the most aggressive glioma in the adult population. Despite recent research efforts, the prognosis of patients with GB has remained dismal. Lately, the knowledge of genetic information about gliomagenesis has increased; we even have a classification of the genetic expression of the tumour. The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new expectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival.

In general, glioblastomas with a subclass transition showed upregulated metabolic processes. Newly diagnosed glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition displayed increased stem cell-like states and decreased immune components at diagnosis and exhibited elevated immune signatures and cytokine levels in serum. In contrast, tissue of recurrent glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition showed increased immune components but decreased stem cell-like states. Survival analyses revealed comparable outcomes for patients with and without subclass transitions.

The MGMT promoter methylation status allows for a stratification of treatment beyond the surgical intervention. In patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors, monotherapy with temozolomide is superior to radiotherapy alone. Similarly, the benefit conferred by combined temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone is largely restricted to patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors. At recurrence, no standard treatment has been established. The prognosis for elderly patients with glioblastoma remains poor. The MGMT promoter methylation status helps guiding treatment decisions and withholding inactive, but potentially harmful treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324304
"""[(89)Zr]-CD8 ImmunoPET imaging of glioblastoma multiforme response to combination oncolytic viral and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy reveals CD8 infiltration differential changes in preclinical models.""","""Rationale: Novel immune-activating therapeutics for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have shown potential for tumor regression and increased survival over standard therapies. However, immunotherapy efficacy remains inconsistent with response assessment being complicated by early treatment-induced apparent radiological tumor progression and slow downstream effects. This inability to determine early immunotherapeutic benefit results in a drastically decreased window for alternative, and potentially more effective, treatment options. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of combination immunotherapy on early CD8+ cell infiltration and its association with long term response in orthotopic syngeneic glioblastoma models. Methods: Luciferase positive GBM orthotopic mouse models (GSC005-luc) were imaged via [89Zr]-CD8 positron emission tomography (PET) one week following treatment with saline, anti-PD1, M002 oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) or combination immunotherapy. Subsequently, brains were excised, imaged via [89Zr]-CD8 ImmunoPET and evaluated though autoradiography and histology for H&E and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Longitudinal immunotherapeutic effects were evaluated through [89Zr]-CD8 PET imaging one- and three-weeks following treatment, with changes in tumor volume monitored on a three-day basis via bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Response classification was then performed based on long-term BLI signal changes. Statistical analysis was performed between groups using one-way ANOVA and two-sided unpaired T-test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Correlations between imaging and biological validation were assessed via Pearson's correlation test. Results: [89Zr]-CD8 PET standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification was correlated with ex vivo SUV quantification (r = 0.61, p < 0.01), autoradiography (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), and IHC tumor CD8+ cell density (r = 0.55, p < 0.01). Classification of therapeutic responders, via bioluminescence signal, revealed a more homogeneous CD8+ immune cell distribution in responders (p < 0.05) one-week following immunotherapy. Conclusions: Assessment of early CD8+ cell infiltration and distribution in the tumor microenvironment provides potential imaging metrics for the characterization of oHSV and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy response in GBM. The combination therapies showed enhanced efficacy compared to single agent immunotherapies. Further development of immune-focused imaging methods can provide clinically relevant metrics associated with immune cell localization that can inform immunotherapeutic efficacy and subsequent treatment response in GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38250045
"""Hypoxia within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment: a master saboteur of novel treatments.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors are the most aggressive primary brain tumors in adults that, despite maximum treatment, carry a dismal prognosis. GBM tumors exhibit tissue hypoxia, which promotes tumor aggressiveness and maintenance of glioma stem cells and creates an overall immunosuppressive landscape. This article reviews how hypoxic conditions overlap with inflammatory responses, favoring the proliferation of immunosuppressive cells and inhibiting cytotoxic T cell development. Immunotherapies, including vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy, represent promising avenues for GBM treatment. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive TME, and BBB restrictiveness hinder their effectiveness. Strategies to address these challenges, including combination therapies and targeting hypoxia, are actively being explored to improve outcomes for GBM patients. Targeting hypoxia in combination with immunotherapy represents a potential strategy to enhance treatment efficacy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38994360
"""Targeted drug delivery for treatment and imaging of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a grade IV astrocytic tumor with a very high mortality rate. Although current treatment often includes surgical resection, this rarely removes all primary tumor cells, so is usually followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Remaining migratory tumor cells invade surrounding healthy tissue and contribute to secondary and tertiary tumor recurrence; therefore, despite significant research into glioma removal and treatment, prognosis remains poor. A variety of treatment modalities have been investigated to deliver drug to these cells, including systemic, diffusive and convection-enhanced delivery (CED). As systemic delivery is limited by molecules larger than approximately 500 Da being unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), therapeutic concentrations are difficult to attain; thus, localized delivery options relying on diffusion and CED have been used to circumvent the BBB. Although CED enables delivery to a greater volume of tissue than diffusive delivery alone, limitations still exist, requiring that these delivery strategies be improved. This review enumerates the strengths and weaknesses of these currently used strategies and details how predictive mathematical modeling can be used to aid investigators in optimizing these delivery modalities for clinical application.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19538036

"""Glioblastoma therapy: State of the field and future prospects.""","""Glioblastoma (GB) is a cancerous brain tumor that originates from glial cells and leads to thousands of deaths each year and a five-year survival of only 6.8 %. Treatments for GB include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. GB is an incurable fatal disease, necessitating the development of innovative strategies to find a developing effective therapy. Genetic therapies may be crucial in treating GB by identifying the mutations and amplifications of multiple genes, which drive its proliferation and spread. Use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) provides a novel technology used to suppress the genes associated with disease, which forms a basis for targeted therapy in GB and its stem cell population, which are recognized for their ability to develop resistance to chemotherapy and tumorigenic capabilities. This review examines the use of siRNAs in GB, emphasizing their effectiveness in suppressing key oncogenes and signaling pathways associated with tumor development, invasion, stemness, and resistance to standard treatments. siRNA-based gene silencing is a promising approach for developing targeted therapeutics against GB and associated stem cell populations, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates in this devastating disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39537100
"""Lessons learned from phase 3 trials of immunotherapy for glioblastoma: Time for longitudinal sampling?""","""Glioblastoma (GBM)'s median overall survival is almost 21 months. Six phase 3 immunotherapy clinical trials have recently been published, yet 5/6 did not meet approval by regulatory bodies. For the sixth, approval is uncertain. Trial failures result from multiple factors, ranging from intrinsic tumor biology to clinical trial design. Understanding the clinical and basic science of these 6 trials is compelled by other immunotherapies reaching the point of advanced phase 3 clinical trial testing. We need to understand more of the science in human GBMs in early trials: the 'window of opportunity' design may not be best to understand complex changes brought about by immunotherapeutic perturbations of the GBM microenvironment. The convergence of increased safety of image-guided biopsies with 'multi-omics' of small cell numbers now permits longitudinal sampling of tumor and biofluids to dissect the complex temporal changes in the GBM microenvironment as a function of the immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37995317
"""Prospective Feasibility Trial for Genomics-Informed Treatment in Recurrent and Progressive Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma is an aggressive and molecularly heterogeneous cancer with few effective treatment options. We hypothesized that next-generation sequencing can be used to guide treatment recommendations within a clinically acceptable time frame following surgery for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.Experimental Design: We conducted a prospective genomics-informed feasibility trial in adults with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma. Following surgical resection, genome-wide tumor/normal exome sequencing and tumor RNA sequencing were performed to identify molecular targets for potential matched therapy. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board issued treatment recommendations based on the genomic results, blood-brain barrier penetration of the indicated therapies, drug-drug interactions, and drug safety profiles. Feasibility of generating genomics-informed treatment recommendations within 35 days of surgery was assessed.Results: Of the 20 patients enrolled in the study, 16 patients had sufficient tumor tissue for analysis. Exome sequencing was completed for all patients, and RNA sequencing was completed for 14 patients. Treatment recommendations were provided within the study's feasibility time frame for 15 of 16 (94%) patients. Seven patients received treatment based on the tumor board recommendations. Two patients reached 12-month progression-free survival, both adhering to treatments based on the molecular profiling results. One patient remained on treatment and progression free 21 months after surgery, 3 times longer than the patient's previous time to progression. Analysis of matched nonenhancing tissue from 12 patients revealed overlapping as well as novel putatively actionable genomic alterations.Conclusions: Use of genome-wide molecular profiling is feasible and can be informative for guiding real-time, central nervous system-penetrant, genomics-informed treatment recommendations for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

"""Galectins as Emerging Glyco-Checkpoints and Therapeutic Targets in Glioblastoma.""","""Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the adult population, urging identification of new rational therapeutic targets. Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, are highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and delineate prognosis and clinical outcome in patients with GBM. These endogenous lectins play key roles in different hallmarks of cancer by modulating tumor cell proliferation, oncogenic signaling, migration, vascularization and immunity. Additionally, they have emerged as mediators of resistance to different anticancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapy. Particularly in GBM, galectins control tumor cell transformation and proliferation, reprogram tumor cell migration and invasion, promote vascularization, modulate cell death pathways, and shape the tumor-immune landscape by targeting myeloid, natural killer (NK), and CD8+ T cell compartments. Here, we discuss the role of galectins, particularly galectin-1, -3, -8, and -9, as emerging glyco-checkpoints that control different mechanisms associated with GBM progression, and discuss possible therapeutic opportunities based on inhibition of galectin-driven circuits, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008740

Importantly, CED circumvents therapeutic challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier by facilitating concentrated local therapeutic drug delivery with limited systemic effects.

Despite multimodal therapy incorporating maximal safe resection, radiotherapy, and temozolomide, clinical outcomes remain poor. At disease progression or relapse, available systemic agents such as temozolomide, lomustine, and bevacizumab have limited efficacy. We review the recent advances in the treatment of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Recent findings: A broad repertoire of systemic agents is in the early stages of development, encompassing the areas of precision medicine, immunotherapy, and repurposed medications. The use of medical devices may present opportunities to bypass the blood-brain barrier. Novel clinical trial designs aim to efficiently test treatment options to advance the field.

"""DDRugging glioblastoma: understanding and targeting the DNA damage response to improve future therapies.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequently diagnosed type of primary brain tumour in adults. These aggressive tumours are characterised by inherent treatment resistance and disease progression, contributing to ~ 190 000 brain tumour-related deaths globally each year. Current therapeutic interventions consist of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, but average survival is typically around 1 year, with < 10% of patients surviving more than 5 years. Recently, a fourth treatment modality of intermediate-frequency low-intensity electric fields [called tumour-treating fields (TTFields)] was clinically approved for glioblastoma in some countries after it was found to increase median overall survival rates by ~ 5 months in a phase III randomised clinical trial. However, beyond these treatments, attempts to establish more effective therapies have yielded little improvement in survival for patients over the last 50 years. This is in contrast to many other types of cancer and highlights glioblastoma as a recognised tumour of unmet clinical need. Previous work has revealed that glioblastomas contain stem cell-like subpopulations that exhibit heightened expression of DNA damage response (DDR) factors, contributing to therapy resistance and disease relapse. Given that radiotherapy, chemotherapy and TTFields-based therapies all impact DDR mechanisms, this Review will focus on our current knowledge of the role of the DDR in glioblastoma biology and treatment. We also discuss the potential of effective multimodal targeting of the DDR combined with standard-of-care therapies, as well as emerging therapeutic targets, in providing much-needed improvements in survival rates for patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34036721

"""A perspective on the radiopharmaceutical requirements for imaging and therapy of glioblastoma.""","""Despite numerous clinical trials and pre-clinical developments, the treatment of glioblastoma (GB) remains a challenge. The current survival rate of GB averages one year, even with an optimal standard of care. However, the future promises efficient patient-tailored treatments, including targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). Advances in radiopharmaceutical development have unlocked the possibility to assess disease at the molecular level allowing individual diagnosis. This leads to the possibility of choosing a tailored, targeted approach for therapeutic modalities. Therapeutic modalities based on radiopharmaceuticals are an exciting development with great potential to promote a personalised approach to medicine. However, an effective targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) for the treatment of GB entails caveats and requisites. This review provides an overview of existing nuclear imaging and TRT strategies for GB. A critical discussion of the optimal characteristics for new GB targeting therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals and clinical indications are provided. Considerations for target selection are discussed, i.e. specific presence of the target, expression level and pharmacological access to the target, with particular attention to blood-brain barrier crossing. An overview of the most promising radionuclides is given along with a validation of the relevant radiopharmaceuticals and theranostic agents (based on small molecules, peptides and monoclonal antibodies).

"""[Radiosurgery for recurrent glioblastoma].""","""Background: Despite the combined treatment in accordance with modern standards, recurrent glioblastoma usually occurs within several months after resection and causes low relapse-free and overall survival. One of the most effective methods for malignant glioma progression is repeated radiotherapy. Indications for this approach have expanded after introduction of stereotactic irradiation into routine clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate the results of radiosurgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and to identify the factors determining its effectiveness. Material and methods: Radiosurgery has been carried out in 168 patients with relapses of glioblastoma between 2005 and 2021. This study enrolled 88 patients with 180 foci of local and distant progression. Mean age of patients was 42.8±2.1 years (range 4-73). Mean period between diagnosis and repeated irradiation was 12.7 months. Mean volume of focus was 2.4 cm3, mean dose - 20 Gy. Median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 11.2 months. Results: Repeated irradiation with correction of systemic therapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival with insignificant radiation-induced toxicity. Annual overall survival was 62.2%, median of overall survival after radiosurgery - 15.1 months. Significant factors of local control were marginal dose of at least 18 Gy and distant relapse. Median of progression-free survival in the group of distant progression of glioblastoma was only 3.6 months vs. 9.1 months in patients with local recurrence. Conclusion: Repeated irradiation in radiosurgery mode with a dose of 18 Gy and higher is an effective option for local treatment increasing progression-free and overall survival in patients with progression of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951763
