"""Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Defining histopathologic features are necrosis and endothelial proliferation, resulting in the assignment of grade IV, the highest grade in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors. The classic clinical term 'secondary glioblastoma' refers to a minority of glioblastomas that evolve from previously diagnosed WHO grade II or grade III gliomas. Specific point mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 appear to define molecularly these tumors that are associated with younger age and more favorable outcome; the vast majority of glioblastomas are IDH wild-type. Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) signaling. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. Promoter methylation of the gene encoding the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide and guides choice of first-line treatment in elderly patients. Current developments focus on targeting the molecular characteristics that drive the malignant phenotype, including altered signal transduction and angiogenesis, and more recently, various approaches of immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948367
"""Glioblastoma and Other Primary Brain Malignancies in Adults: A Review.""","""Importance: Malignant primary brain tumors cause more than 15 000 deaths per year in the United States. The annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals and increases with age. Five-year survival is approximately 36%. Observations: Approximately 49% of malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas, and 30% are diffusely infiltrating lower-grade gliomas. Other malignant brain tumors include primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (7%) and malignant forms of ependymomas (3%) and meningiomas (2%). Symptoms of malignant brain tumors include headache (50%), seizures (20%-50%), neurocognitive impairment (30%-40%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%-40%). Magnetic resonance imaging before and after a gadolinium-based contrast agent is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating brain tumors. Diagnosis requires tumor biopsy with consideration of histopathological and molecular characteristics. Treatment varies by tumor type and often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. For patients with glioblastoma, the combination of temozolomide with radiotherapy improved survival when compared with radiotherapy alone (2-year survival, 27.2% vs 10.9%; 5-year survival, 9.8% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.7]; P < .001). In patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q codeletion, probable 20-year overall survival following radiotherapy without vs with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine was 13.6% vs 37.1% (80 patients; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.35-1.03]; P = .06) in the EORTC 26951 trial and 14.9% vs 37% in the RTOG 9402 trial (125 patients; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40-0.94]; P = .02). Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma includes high-dose methotrexate-containing regimens, followed by consolidation therapy with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimens, or whole brain radiation. Conclusions and relevance: The incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals, and approximately 49% of primary malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas. Most patients die from progressive disease. First-line therapy for glioblastoma is surgery followed by radiation and the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318
"""Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541850
"""A Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoid Model and Biobank Recapitulates Inter- and Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity.""","""Glioblastomas exhibit vast inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models are limited in preserving the cellular and mutational diversity of parental tumors and require a prolonged generation time. Here, we report methods for generating and biobanking patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) that recapitulate the histological features, cellular diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of their corresponding parental tumors. GBOs can be generated quickly with high reliability and exhibit rapid, aggressive infiltration when transplanted into adult rodent brains. We further demonstrate the utility of GBOs to test personalized therapies by correlating GBO mutational profiles with responses to specific drugs and by modeling chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. Our studies show that GBOs maintain many key features of glioblastomas and can be rapidly deployed to investigate patient-specific treatment strategies. Additionally, our live biobank establishes a rich resource for basic and translational glioblastoma research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883794
"""Glioblastoma: Overview of Disease and Treatment.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. Current treatment options at diagnosis are multimodal and include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology of GBM and associated cell signaling pathways have opened opportunities for new therapies for recurrent and newly diagnosed disease. Innovative treatments, such as tumor-treating fields (TTFields) and immunotherapy, give hope for enhanced survival. Objectives: This article reviews the background, risks, common complications, and treatment options for GBM. Methods: A brief review of GBM, treatment options, and a look at new therapies that have been approved for new and recurrent disease are included in this article. Findings: Despite aggressive resection and combined modality adjuvant treatment, most GBMs recur. Treatments, such as TTFields, drugs to target molecular receptors, and immunotherapy, are promising new options.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27668386
"""Glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas: a clinical review.""","""Importance: Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. Objective: To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications. Evidence review: Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system. Findings: Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis. Conclusions and relevance: Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193082
"""Glioblastoma in adults: a Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and European Society of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) consensus review on current management and future directions.""","""Glioblastomas are the most common form of malignant primary brain tumor and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In recent years there have been important advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis and biology of these tumors, but this has not translated into significantly improved outcomes for patients. In this consensus review from the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO), the current management of isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastomas will be discussed. In addition, novel therapies such as targeted molecular therapies, agents targeting DNA damage response and metabolism, immunotherapies, and viral therapies will be reviewed, as well as the current challenges and future directions for research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32328653
"""Recent Developments in Glioblastoma Therapy: Oncolytic Viruses and Emerging Future Strategies.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. Standard treatment protocols and traditional immunotherapy are poorly effective as they do not significantly increase the long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) may be an effective alternative approach. Combining OVs with some modern treatment options may also provide significant benefits for glioblastoma patients. Here we review virotherapy for glioblastomas and describe several OVs and their combination with other therapies. The personalized use of OVs and their combination with other treatment options would become a significant area of research aiming to develop the most effective treatment regimens for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851761
"""A comprehensive profile of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""In spite of relentless efforts to devise new treatment strategies, primary glioblastomas invariably recur as aggressive, therapy-resistant relapses and patients rapidly succumb to these tumors. Many therapeutic agents are first tested in clinical trials involving recurrent glioblastomas. Remarkably, however, fundamental knowledge on the biology of recurrent glioblastoma is just slowly emerging. Here, we review current knowledge on recurrent glioblastoma and ask whether and how therapies change intra-tumor heterogeneity, molecular traits and growth pattern of glioblastoma, and to which extent this information can be exploited for therapeutic decision-making. We conclude that the ability to characterize and predict therapy-induced changes in recurrent glioblastoma will determine, whether, one day, glioblastoma can be contained in a state of chronic disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041580
"""Glioblastoma stem cells: lessons from the tumor hierarchy in a lethal cancer.""","""Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of all human cancers. Glioblastomas display striking cellular heterogeneity, with stem-like glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex. Although the original identification of GSCs dates back more than a decade, the purification and characterization of GSCs remains challenging. Despite these challenges, the evidence that GSCs play important roles in tumor growth and response to therapy has grown. Like normal stem cells, GSCs are functionally defined and distinguished from their differentiated tumor progeny at core transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulatory levels, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality will be universally effective against a heterogenous GSC population. Glioblastomas induce a systemic immunosuppression with mixed responses to oncoimmunologic modalities, suggesting the potential for augmentation of response with a deeper consideration of GSCs. Unfortunately, the GSC literature has been complicated by frequent use of inferior cell lines and a lack of proper functional analyses. Collectively, glioblastoma offers a reliable cancer to study cancer stem cells to better model the human disease and inform improved biologic understanding and design of novel therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160393
"""Current status and recent advances in reirradiation of glioblastoma.""","""Despite aggressive management consisting of maximal safe surgical resection followed by external beam radiation therapy (60 Gy/30 fractions) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide, approximately 90% of WHO grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas, GBM) will recur locally within 2 years. For patients with recurrent GBM, no standard of care exists. Thanks to the continuous improvement in radiation science and technology, reirradiation has emerged as feasible approach for patients with brain tumors. Using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), either hypofractionated or conventionally fractionated schedules, several studies have suggested survival benefits following reirradiation of patients with recurrent GBM; however, there are still questions to be answered about the efficacy and toxicity associated with a second course of radiation. We provide a clinical overview on current status and recent advances in reirradiation of GBM, addressing relevant clinical questions such as the appropriate patient selection and radiation technique, optimal dose fractionation, reirradiation tolerance of the brain and the risk of radiation necrosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602305
"""The definition of primary and secondary glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. The vast majority of glioblastomas (~90%) develop rapidly de novo in elderly patients, without clinical or histologic evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastomas). Secondary glioblastomas progress from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. They manifest in younger patients, have a lesser degree of necrosis, are preferentially located in the frontal lobe, and carry a significantly better prognosis. Histologically, primary and secondary glioblastomas are largely indistinguishable, but they differ in their genetic and epigenetic profiles. Decisive genetic signposts of secondary glioblastoma are IDH1 mutations, which are absent in primary glioblastomas and which are associated with a hypermethylation phenotype. IDH1 mutations are the earliest detectable genetic alteration in precursor low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and in oligodendrogliomas, indicating that these tumors are derived from neural precursor cells that differ from those of primary glioblastomas. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical, histopathologic, genetic, and expression features of primary and secondary glioblastomas and the biologic consequences of IDH1 mutations. We conclude that this genetic alteration is a definitive diagnostic molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas and more reliable and objective than clinical criteria. Despite a similar histologic appearance, primary and secondary glioblastomas are distinct tumor entities that originate from different precursor cells and may require different therapeutic approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23209033
"""Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors. Despite the availability of standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), i.e., Stupp protocol, which involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains refractory to treatment and recurrence is inevitable. Moreover, the biology of recurrent glioblastoma remains unclear. Increasing evidence has shown that intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapeutic resistance. However, the interaction between intracellular heterogeneity and drug resistance in recurrent GBMs remains controversial. The aim of this study was to map the transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in recurrent and drug-resistant GBMs at a single-cell resolution and further explore the mechanism of drug resistance of GBMs. We analyzed six tumor tissue samples from three patients with primary GBM and three patients with recurrent GBM in which recurrence and drug resistance developed after treatment with the standard Stupp protocol using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using unbiased clustering, nine major cell clusters were identified. Upregulation of the expression of stemness-related and cell-cycle-related genes was observed in recurrent GBM cells. Compared with the initial GBM tissues, recurrent GBM tissues showed a decreased proportion of microglia, consistent with previous reports. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and the blood-brain barrier permeability were high, and the O6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-related signaling pathway was activated in recurrent GBM. Our results delineate the single-cell map of recurrent glioblastoma, tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms, providing new insights into treatment strategies for recurrent glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36853018
"""Glioblastoma stem cell metabolism and immunity.""","""Despite enormous efforts being invested in the development of novel therapies for brain malignancies, there remains a dire need for effective treatments, particularly for pediatric glioblastomas. Their poor prognosis has been attributed to the fact that conventional therapies target tumoral cells, but not glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are characterized by self-renewal, tumorigenicity, poor differentiation, and resistance to therapy. These characteristics represent the fundamental tools needed to recapitulate the tumor and result in a relapse. The mechanisms by which GSCs alter metabolic cues and escape elimination by immune cells are discussed in this article, along with potential strategies to harness effector immune cells against GSCs. As cellular immunotherapy is making significant advances in a variety of cancers, leveraging this underexplored reservoir may result in significant improvements in the treatment options for brain malignancies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38530545
"""Single-cell characterization of macrophages in glioblastoma reveals MARCO as a mesenchymal pro-tumor marker.""","""Background: Macrophages are the most common infiltrating immune cells in gliomas and play a wide variety of pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. However, the different subpopulations of macrophages and their effects on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Methods: We combined new and previously published single-cell RNA-seq data from 98,015 single cells from a total of 66 gliomas to profile 19,331 individual macrophages. Results: Unsupervised clustering revealed a pro-tumor subpopulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages characterized by the scavenger receptor MARCO, which is almost exclusively found in IDH1-wild-type glioblastomas. Previous studies have implicated MARCO as an unfavorable marker in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; here, we find that bulk MARCO expression is associated with worse prognosis and mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, MARCO expression is significantly altered over the course of treatment with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors in a response-dependent manner, which we validate with immunofluorescence imaging. Conclusions: These findings illustrate a novel macrophage subpopulation that drives tumor progression in glioblastomas and suggest potential therapeutic targets to prevent their recruitment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34011400
"""Medicinal Plants for Glioblastoma Treatment.""","""Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, demonstrates the least life expectancy among all brain cancers. Because of the regulation of diverse signaling pathways in cancers, the chemotherapeutic approaches used to suppress their multiplication and spread are restricted. Sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents has been developed because of the pathological and drug-evading abilities of these diverse mechanisms. As a result, the identification and exploration of strategies or treatments, which can overcome such refractory obstacles to improve glioblastoma response to treatment as well as recovery, is essential. Medicinal herbs contain a wide variety of bioactive compounds, which could trigger aggressive brain cancers, regulate their anti-cancer mechanisms and immune responses to assist in cancer elimination, and cause cell death. Numerous tumor-causing proteins, which facilitate invasion as well as metastasis of cancer, tolerance of chemotherapies, and angiogenesis, are also inhibited by these phytochemicals. Such herbs remain valuable for glioblastoma prevention and its incidence by effectively being used as anti-glioma therapies. This review thus presents the latest findings on medicinal plants using which the extracts or bioactive components are being used against glioblastoma, their mechanism of functioning, pharmacological description, and recent clinical studies conducted on them.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939551
"""Understanding glioblastoma at the single-cell level: Recent advances and future challenges.""","""Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38814900
"""The cause of death in patients with glioblastoma is multifactorial: clinical factors and autopsy findings in 117 cases of supratentorial glioblastoma in adults.""","""To delineate the causes of death (COD) in adults with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GM) we reviewed 117 consecutive cases examined at autopsy over a nineteen year period at the University of Washington. Twenty cases (17%) had expired unexpectedly without ante mortem diagnosis, 5 patients (4%) had been diagnosed as having lower grade astrocytomas prior to death. Other than the 20 patients without ante mortem diagnosis, all patients had a surgical procedure for treatment and/or diagnosis (biopsy 10%, craniotomy 90%). Postsurgical therapy varied, but there was no significant difference in median length of survival among the different treatment groups. Factors considered as potential COD were: herniation (axial, transtentorial, subfalcine, tonsillar), surgical complications (death within thirty days of surgery secondary to cerebral hemorrhage and/or edema), severe systemic illness, brainstem invasion by tumor, and neutron-induced cerebral injury (cerebral and brainstem gliosis were evident in these cases). A potential COD could be identified in 93% of patients. Patients with no ante mortem diagnosis were likely to have herniated (p = 0.01), whereas patients who underwent neutron irradiation were unlikely to have herniated (p = 0.001). No other variables were statistically significant predictors of herniation, including multifocal tumors (20 patients), and brainstem invasion by tumor (18 patients). No patients died as a result of treatment except those who underwent neutron radiotherapy and those who died postoperatively. Although significant mass effect, as evidenced by herniation, was apparent in 61% of patients, most of these patients had an additional identifiable COD. We conclude that the COD in patients with GM varies and is multifactorial.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1654403
"""Glioblastoma microenvironment: The stromal interactions.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common primary brain tumors with poor prognosis due to their aggressive growth accompanied by invasive behavior and therapy-resistance. These features promote a high rate of recurrence; therefore, they are largely incurable. One major cause of the incurability is brought about by the intimate relationship of GBM cells with the microenvironment, which supports the tumor growth in various ways by providing a permissive neighborhood. In the tumor microenvironment are glioma stem cells (GSC); endothelial cells (EC) and hypoxic regions; immune cells and immune modulatory cues; astrocytes; neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Each cell type contributes to GBM pathology in unique ways; therefore, it is necessary to understand such interactions between GBM cells and the stromal cells in order to establish a through understanding of the GBM pathology. By explaining the contribution of each stromal entity to GBM pathology we aim to draw an interaction map for GBMs and promote awareness of the complexity of the GBM microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228161
"""Single-cell landscapes of primary glioblastomas and matched explants and cell lines show variable retention of inter- and intratumor heterogeneity.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive brain tumors characterized by extensive inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Patient-derived models, such as organoids and explants, have recently emerged as useful models to study such heterogeneity, although the extent to which they can recapitulate GBM genomic features remains unclear. Here, we analyze bulk exome and single-cell genome and transcriptome profiles of 12 IDH wild-type GBMs, including two recurrent tumors, and of patient-derived explants (PDEs) and gliomasphere (GS) lines derived from these tumors. We find that PDEs are genetically similar to, and variably retain gene expression characteristics of, their parent tumors. Notably, PDEs appear to exhibit similar levels of transcriptional heterogeneity compared with their parent tumors, whereas GS lines tend to be enriched for cells in a more uniform transcriptional state. The approaches and datasets introduced here will provide a valuable resource to help guide experiments using GBM-derived models, especially in the context of studying cellular heterogeneity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303420
"""Intraventricular Glioblastomas.""","""Background and importance: Although glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor, primary intraventricular locations are extremely rare; only 21 cases have been reported to date. Methods: A retrospectively acquired database of all intracranial glioblastomas treated in 2 different neurosurgical departments during the last 10 years was queried. Patients with histologically proven intraventricular glioblastomas were included in the study. Results: Eight patients were identified as having a histologically confirmed intraventricular glioblastoma. Patient age at diagnosis ranged from 6 to 74 years (mean 29.6 years) and the male/female ratio was 5:3. Increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus was the main cause of the clinical manifestations. The tumor was located within the lateral ventricle in 6 cases and the anterior third ventricle in 2 others. Gross total tumor excision was achieved in 3 patients, whereas the surgical resection was subtotal in 4 cases and a surgical biopsy was performed in 1 patient. Postoperative adjuvant therapies were administered in 5 patients. Median survival time was 32.1 months, and 3 patients were alive at the end of study. All of them had isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated tumors. Conclusions: Intraventricular glioblastoma is extremely rare and can affect younger individuals including children. This malignant tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular lesions, especially in the lateral ventricles. Radical surgical resection can be associated with remarkable disease-free survival, especially in isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated tumors.

"""Neoplastic Myelopathies.""","""Purpose of review: This article discusses the diagnosis and management of neoplasms that affect the spinal cord as well as spinal cord disorders that can occur due to cancer treatments. Recent findings: Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are IDH-mutant tumors, whereas only 10% of glioblastomas are IDH-mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically IDH-mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location. NF2 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome. Summary: Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers. The knowledge of the clinical features and management of neoplastic myelopathies is essential to practicing neurologists as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent devastating neurologic sequelae.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29613896
"""Risk factors for glioblastoma are shared by other brain tumor types.""","""The reported risk factors for glioblastoma (GBM), i.e., ionizing radiation, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Neurofibromatosis I, and Turcot syndrome, also increase the risk of other brain tumor types. Risk factors for human GBM are associated with different oncogenic mutation profiles. Pedigreed domestic dogs with a shorter nose and flatter face (brachycephalic dogs) display relatively high rates of glioma formation. The genetic profiles of canine gliomas are also idiosyncratic. The association of putatively different mutational patterns in humans and canines with GBM suggests that different oncogenic pathways can result in GBM formation. Strong epidemiological evidence for an association between exposure to chemical carcinogens and an increased risk for development of GBM is currently lacking. Ionizing radiation induces point mutations, frameshift mutations, double-strand breaks, and chromosomal insertions or deletions. Mutational profiles associated with chemical exposures overlap with the broad mutational patterns seen with ionizing radiation. Weak statistical associations between chemical exposures and GBM reported in epidemiology studies are biologically plausible. Molecular approaches comparing reproducible patterns seen in spontaneous GBM with analogous patterns found in GBMs resected from patients with known significant exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals can address difficulties presented by traditional exposure assessment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520250
"""Temporal change of DNA methylation subclasses between matched newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.""","""The longitudinal transition of phenotypes is pivotal in glioblastoma treatment resistance and DNA methylation emerged as an important tool for classifying glioblastoma phenotypes. We aimed to characterize DNA methylation subclass heterogeneity during progression and assess its clinical impact. Matched tissues from 47 glioblastoma patients were subjected to DNA methylation profiling, including CpG-site alterations, tissue and serum deconvolution, mass spectrometry, and immunoassay. Effects of clinical characteristics on temporal changes and outcomes were studied. Among 47 patients, 8 (17.0%) had non-matching classifications at recurrence. In the remaining 39 cases, 28.2% showed dominant DNA methylation subclass transitions, with 72.7% being a mesenchymal subclass. In general, glioblastomas with a subclass transition showed upregulated metabolic processes. Newly diagnosed glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition displayed increased stem cell-like states and decreased immune components at diagnosis and exhibited elevated immune signatures and cytokine levels in serum. In contrast, tissue of recurrent glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition showed increased immune components but decreased stem cell-like states. Survival analyses revealed comparable outcomes for patients with and without subclass transitions. This study demonstrates a temporal heterogeneity of DNA methylation subclasses in 28.2% of glioblastomas, not impacting patient survival. Changes in cell state composition associated with subclass transition may be crucial for recurrent glioblastoma targeted therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38244080
"""Autophagy machinery in glioblastoma: The prospect of cell death crosstalk and drug resistance with bioinformatics analysis.""","""Brain tumors are common malignancies with high mortality and morbidity in which glioblastoma (GB) is a grade IV astrocytoma with heterogeneous nature. The conventional therapeutics for the GB mainly include surgery and chemotherapy, however their efficacy has been compromised due to the aggressiveness of tumor cells. The dysregulation of cell death mechanisms, especially autophagy has been reported as a factor causing difficulties in cancer therapy. As a mechanism contributing to cell homeostasis, the autophagy process is hijacked by tumor cells for the purpose of aggravating cancer progression and drug resistance. The autophagy function is context-dependent and its role can be lethal or protective in cancer. The aim of the current paper is to highlight the role of autophagy in the regulation of GB progression. The cytotoxic function of autophagy can promote apoptosis and ferroptosis in GB cells and vice versa. Autophagy dysregulation can cause drug resistance and radioresistance in GB. Moreover, stemness can be regulated by autophagy and overall growth as well as metastasis are affected by autophagy. The various interventions including administration of synthetic/natural products and nanoplatforms can target autophagy. Therefore, autophagy can act as a promising target in GB therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37977349
"""Management of Elderly Patients with Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose of review: Glioblastoma represents one of the major challenges in neurooncology and approximately half of the patients are 60 years or older. We summarize the particular situation of elderly glioblastoma patients with a focus on therapeutic considerations. Recent findings: Favorable molecular markers such as mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 genes are virtually absent in glioblastomas in elderly patients. Treatment options are similar to the situation in young patients and comprise surgical resection, radiation therapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. The performance status as well as comorbidities may have a stronger impact on the individual treatment decision than in young patients. The MGMT promoter methylation status allows for a stratification of treatment beyond the surgical intervention. In patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors, monotherapy with temozolomide is superior to radiotherapy alone. Similarly, the benefit conferred by combined temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone is largely restricted to patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors. At recurrence, no standard treatment has been established. The prognosis for elderly patients with glioblastoma remains poor. The MGMT promoter methylation status helps guiding treatment decisions and withholding inactive, but potentially harmful treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324304
"""Role of Epstein-Barr Virus in Glioblastoma.""","""Gliomas are the most common and most lethal primary malignant adult brain tumors, and glioblastomas are the most frequent. Several risk factors are involved in their pathogenesis; these include environmental factors as well as host factors. The etiology of most gliomas remains unknown. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a member of the Herpesviridae family, was the first tumoral virus to be described, and several viruses in connection with cancer were discovered thereafter. During the complex interaction between host and EBV, several events take place. In the context of survival, EBV can drive its host cells with subsequent disruption of the cellular machinery, leading to tumorigenesis as the final outcome. Thus, the EBV infection has been associated with different tumors. In this review, we discuss EBV and cancer. We have analyzed previously published papers and have conducted a critical analysis on the role of the viral infection in glioblastoma. Several works have described the presence of the virus, but none have shown a conclusive association. Thus, there is need to continue analyzing the interaction between host and virus to determine whether the viral presence is incidental or has some association with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32421988
"""Surgical site infections after glioblastoma surgery: boon or bane?""","""Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common postoperative complications. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent malignant brain tumor with a dismal prognosis despite combined treatment. The effect of SSIs on the course of glioblastoma patients has not been fully clarified since available data are limited and partially contradictory. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of SSIs on the course of patients with glioblastoma. Methods: The medical records of all patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma between 2010 and 2020 in our institution were scanned and those with surgical site infections after glioblastoma resection were identified and compared to an age-matched control group. Overall survival and progression-free survival were the primary endpoints followed by the number of hospitalizations and the length of stay in hospital. Results: Out of 305 patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma, 38 patients with postoperative surgical site infection after resection were identified and 15 (5 men and 10 women aged between 9 and 72) were included in this study. 23 patients were excluded. The control group consisted of 30 age-matched patients without SSI (18 men and 12 women). There were no significant differences in median overall survival. Progression-free survival was higher in the SSI group. The number of hospitalizations and the length of stay were significantly higher in the SSI group. Conclusion: Our data suggest that SSIs might reduce early recurrences without affecting overall survival. Furthermore, they might decrease health-related quality of life by doubling the total length of hospital stay.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38279060
"""Extracranial metastasis of brain glioblastoma outside CNS: Pathogenesis revisited.""","""Background: The most prevalent malignant tumor of the CNS in adults is glioblastoma. Despite undergoing surgery and chemoradiotherapy, the prognosis remains unfavorable, with a median survival period ranging between 15 and 20 months. The incidence of glioblastoma metastasis outside CNS is uncommon with only 0.4%-2% reported rate, compared to other tumors that exhibit a 10% incidence rate of metastasis to the brain. On average, it takes about 11 months from the time of initial diagnosis for the tumor to spread beyond CNS. Consequently, the prognosis for metastatic glioblastoma is grim, with a 6-month survival rate following diagnosis. Findings: The rarity of extracranial metastasis is attributed to the blood-brain barrier and lack of a lymphatic drainage system, although rare cases of hematogenous spread and direct implantation have been reported. The possible mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation. Risk factors have been widely described, including previous craniotomy or biopsies, ventricular shunting, young age, radiation therapy, prolonged survival time, and tumor recurrence. Due to the lack of understanding about extracranial metastasis of glioblastoma pathogenesis, no effective treatment exists to date. Aggressive chemotherapies are not recommended for metastatic glioblastoma as their side effects may worsen the patient prognosis. Conclusion: The optimal treatment for extracranial metastasis of glioblastoma requires further investigation with a wide inclusion of patients. This review discusses the possible causes, factors, and underlying mechanisms of glioblastoma metastasis to different organs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37814403

Seizures are not only a common comorbidity of glioblastoma but often an initial clinical symptom of this cancer entity. Both, glioblastoma and tumor-associated epilepsy are closely linked to one another through several pathophysiological mechanisms, with the neurotransmitter glutamate playing a key role. Glutamate interacts with its ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to promote both tumor progression and excitotoxicity. In this review, based on its physiological functions, our current understanding of glutamate receptors and glutamatergic signaling will be discussed in detail. Furthermore, preclinical models to study glutamatergic interactions between glioma cells and the tumor-surrounding microenvironment will be presented.

These or other changed proteins or as yet unrecognized biochemical brain changes of dementia might promote glioblastoma development. Published data indicate that there is an association between Alzheimer's disease prevalence and malignant brain tumor incidence in 19 US states.

"""Glioblastoma patients' survival and its relevant risk factors during the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 pandemic: real-world cohort study in the USA and China.""","""Background: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has exerted potential impact on patients with glioblastomas (GBMs), it remains unclear whether the survival and its related risk factors of GBM patients would be altered or not during the period spanning from pre-COVID-19 to post-COVID-19 pandemic era. This study aimed to clarify the important issues above. Methods: Two observational cohorts were utilized, including the nationwide American cohort from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) and the Chinese glioblastoma cohort (CGC) at our institution during 2018-2020. Demographics, tumour features, treatment regimens and clinical outcomes were collected. Cox regression model, competing risk model, and subgroup and sensitivity analysis were used to dynamically estimate the survival and its relevant risk factors over different diagnosis years from the pre-COVID-19 (2018 and 2019) to post-COVID-19 (2020) pandemic. Causal mediation analysis was further adopted to explore the potential relationship between risk factors and mortality. Results: This study included 11321 GBM cases in SEER and 226 GBM patients in CGC, respectively. Instead of the diagnostic years of 2018-2020, the prognostic risk factors, such as advanced age, bilateral tumour and absence of comprehensive therapy (surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy), were identified to persistently affect GBM survival independently during the period from 2018 to 2020 in the SEER cohort (all P < 0.05). In CGC, lack of comprehensive therapy for GBM patients were restated as survival risk factors during the same timeframe. Causal mediation analysis showed that the effect of comprehensive therapy on all-cause mortality played a determinant role (direct effect value -0.227, 95% CI -0.248 to -0.207), which was partially mediated by age (9.11%) rather than tumour laterality. Conclusions: As the timeframe shifted from pre-COVID-19 to post-COVID-19 pandemic, survival of GBM patients remained stable, yet advanced age, bilateral tumours, and passive treatment continuingly impacted GBM survival. It is necessary to optimize the comprehensive treatment for GBM patients even in the post-pandemic era.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38376848

"""[Radiosurgery for recurrent glioblastoma].""","""Background: Despite the combined treatment in accordance with modern standards, recurrent glioblastoma usually occurs within several months after resection and causes low relapse-free and overall survival. One of the most effective methods for malignant glioma progression is repeated radiotherapy. Indications for this approach have expanded after introduction of stereotactic irradiation into routine clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate the results of radiosurgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and to identify the factors determining its effectiveness. Material and methods: Radiosurgery has been carried out in 168 patients with relapses of glioblastoma between 2005 and 2021. This study enrolled 88 patients with 180 foci of local and distant progression. Mean age of patients was 42.8±2.1 years (range 4-73). Mean period between diagnosis and repeated irradiation was 12.7 months. Mean volume of focus was 2.4 cm3, mean dose - 20 Gy. Median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 11.2 months. Results: Repeated irradiation with correction of systemic therapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival with insignificant radiation-induced toxicity. Annual overall survival was 62.2%, median of overall survival after radiosurgery - 15.1 months. Significant factors of local control were marginal dose of at least 18 Gy and distant relapse. Median of progression-free survival in the group of distant progression of glioblastoma was only 3.6 months vs. 9.1 months in patients with local recurrence. Conclusion: Repeated irradiation in radiosurgery mode with a dose of 18 Gy and higher is an effective option for local treatment increasing progression-free and overall survival in patients with progression of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951763
"""A Conceptual Framework for Inducing T Cell-Mediated Immunity Against Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. Several major challenges have limited the development of novel therapeutics, including the extensive heterogeneity of tumor cell states within each glioblastoma and the ability of glioma cells to diffusely infiltrate into neighboring healthy brain tissue, including the contralateral hemisphere. A T cell-mediated immune response could deal with these challenges based on the ability of polyclonal T cell populations to recognize diverse tumor antigens and perform surveillance throughout tissues. Here we will discuss the major pathways that inhibit T cell-mediated immunity against glioblastoma, with an emphasis on receptor-ligand systems by which glioma cells and recruited myeloid cells inhibit T cell function. A related challenge is that glioblastomas tend to be poorly infiltrated by T cells, which is not only caused by inhibitory molecular pathways but also currently utilized drugs, in particular high-dose corticosteroids that kill activated, proliferating T cells. We will discuss innovative approaches to induce glioblastoma-directed T cell responses, including neoantigen-based vaccines and sophisticated CAR T cell approaches that can target heterogeneous glioblastoma cell populations.

Further intensification of the standard treatment is limited by the infiltrating growth of the GBM in normal brain areas, the expected neurological toxicities with radiation doses >60 Gy and the dose-limiting toxicities induced by systemic therapy. To improve the outcome of patients with GBM, alternative treatment modalities which add low or no additional toxicities to the standard treatment are needed.

Tumor-to-tumor metastasis occurring in gliomas is rare with less than 20 reports described so far, and that into a glioblastoma is even rarer. We report a 54-year man, diagnosed with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, with metastasis of an adenocarcinoma into it. On histomorphology, the glial component was composed of astrocytic cells and showed increased mitosis, microvascular proliferation, and focal necrosis. This was intermingled with an adenocarcinomatous tumor with pleomorphic epithelial cells in glands, nests, and sheets. On immunohistochemistry, the adenocarcinomatous areas were positive for AE1/AE3 and TTF1 but negative for glial markers, ruling out adenoid glioblastoma. Further cytogenetic analysis showed EGFR amplification in the glial component but not in the adenocarcinoma component, ruling out glioblastoma with true epithelial metaplasia, and supporting the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma metastasis into glioblastoma. Glioblastomas may be susceptible to intratumoral metastasis due to the proliferating leaky vascular channels, however, the short survival of patients with glioblastoma may be responsible for the rarity of this occurrence.

Based on comprehensive genomic sequence analyses, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) cataloged somatic mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in glioblastoma. Robust transcriptome and epigenome studies also revealed inter-tumor heterogeneity. Integration and cluster analyses of multi-dimensional genomic data lead to a new classification of glioblastoma tumors into subtypes with distinct biological features and clinical correlates. However, multiple observations also revealed tumor area-specific patterns of genomic imbalance. In addition, genetic alterations have been identified that were common to all areas analyzed and other alterations that were area specific. Analyses of intra-tumor transcriptome variations revealed that in more than half of the examined cases, fragments from the same tumor mass could be classified into at least two different glioblastoma molecular subgroups. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of molecular genetic profiles in glioblastoma may explain the difficulties encountered in the validation of oncologic biomarkers, and contribute to a biased selection of patients for single target therapies, treatment failure or drug resistance.

Methods: We examined the correlation between cell-free circulating mitochondria and venous thrombosis in patients with GBM and the impact of mitochondria on venous thrombosis in mice with inferior vena cava stenosis. Results: Using plasma samples of 82 patients with GBM, we found that patients with GBM had a higher number of mitochondria in their plasma (GBM with venous thromboembolism [VTE],: 2.8 × 107 mitochondria/mL; GBM without VTE, 1.9 × 107 mitochondria/mL) than that in healthy control subjects (n = 17) (0.3 × 107 mitochondria/mL). Interestingly, patients with GBM and VTE (n = 41) had a higher mitochondria concentration than patients with GBM without VTE (n = 41). In a murine model of inferior vena cava stenosis, intravenous delivery of mitochondria resulted in an increased rate of venous thrombosis compared with that in controls (70% and 28%, respectively). Mitochondria-induced venous thrombi were neutrophil-rich and contained more platelets than those in control thrombi. Furthermore, as mitochondria are the only source of cardiolipin in circulation, we compared the concentration of anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G in plasma samples of patients with GBM and found a higher concentration in patients with VTE (optical density, 0.69 ± 0.04) than in those without VTE (optical density, 0.51 ± 0.04). Conclusion: We concluded that mitochondria might play a role in the GBM-induced hypercoagulable state.

Evidence indicates a key role for oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in accelerating tumour evolution and thus resistance to treatment, particularly in glioblastomas. Oncogenes contained within ecDNA can reach high copy numbers and expression levels, and their unequal segregation can result in more rapid copy number changes in response to therapy than is possible through natural selection of intrachromosomal genomic loci. Notably, targeted therapies inhibiting oncogenic pathways have failed to improve glioblastoma outcomes. In this Perspective, we outline reasons for this disappointing lack of clinical translation and present the emerging evidence implicating ecDNA as an important driver of tumour evolution. Furthermore, we suggest that through detection of ecDNA, patient selection for clinical trials of novel agents can be optimized to include those most likely to benefit based on current understanding of resistance mechanisms. We discuss the challenges to successful translation of this approach, including accurate detection of ecDNA in tumour tissue with novel technologies, development of faithful preclinical models for predicting the efficacy of novel agents in the presence of ecDNA oncogenes, and understanding the mechanisms of ecDNA formation during cancer evolution and how they could be attenuated therapeutically.

"""CXCR4 expression in glioblastoma tissue and the potential for PET imaging and treatment with [(68)Ga]Ga-Pentixafor /[(177)Lu]Lu-Pentixather.""","""Purpose: CXCR4 (over)expression is found in multiple human cancer types, while expression is low or absent in healthy tissue. In glioblastoma it is associated with a poor prognosis and more extensive infiltrative phenotype. CXCR4 can be targeted by the diagnostic PET agent [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor and its therapeutic counterpart [177Lu]Lu-Pentixather. We aimed to investigate the expression of CXCR4 in glioblastoma tissue to further examine the potential of these PET agents. Methods: CXCR4 mRNA expression was examined using the R2 genomics platform. Glioblastoma tissue cores were stained for CXCR4. CXCR4 staining in tumor cells was scored. Stained tissue components (cytoplasm and/or nuclei of the tumor cells and blood vessels) were documented. Clinical characteristics and information on IDH and MGMT promoter methylation status were collected. Seven pilot patients with recurrent glioblastoma underwent [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET; residual resected tissue was stained for CXCR4. Results: Two large mRNA datasets (N = 284; N = 540) were assesed. Of the 191 glioblastomas, 426 cores were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Seventy-eight cores (23 tumors) were CXCR4 negative, while 18 cores (5 tumors) had both strong and extensive staining. The remaining 330 cores (163 tumors) showed a large inter- and intra-tumor variation for CXCR4 expression; also seen in the resected tissue of the seven pilot patients-not directly translatable to [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET results. Both mRNA and immunohistochemical analysis showed CXCR4 negative normal brain tissue and no significant correlation between CXCR4 expression and IDH or MGMT status or survival. Conclusion: Using immunohistochemistry, high CXCR4 expression was found in a subset of glioblastomas as well as a large inter- and intra-tumor variation. Caution should be exercised in directly translating ex vivo CXCR4 expression to PET agent uptake. However, when high CXCR4 expression can be identified with [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor, these patients might be good candidates for targeted radionuclide therapy with [177Lu]Lu-Pentixather in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33550492
"""Pharmacometabolomics Informs Quantitative Radiomics for Glioblastoma Diagnostic Innovation.""","""Applications of omics systems biology technologies have enormous promise for radiology and diagnostics in surgical fields. In this context, the emerging fields of radiomics (a systems scale approach to radiology using a host of technologies, including omics) and pharmacometabolomics (use of metabolomics for patient and disease stratification and guiding precision medicine) offer much synergy for diagnostic innovation in surgery, particularly in neurosurgery. This synthesis of omics fields and applications is timely because diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors still challenges decision-making. Considering the vast heterogeneity in brain tumors, disease phenotypes, and interindividual variability in surgical and chemotherapy outcomes, we believe that diagnostic accuracy can be markedly improved by quantitative radiomics coupled to pharmacometabolomics and related health information technologies while optimizing economic costs of traditional diagnostics. In this expert review, we present an innovation analysis on a systems-level multi-omics approach toward diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors. For this, we suggest that glioblastomas serve as a useful application paradigm. We performed a literature search on PubMed for articles published in English between 2006 and 2016. We used the search terms 'radiomics,' 'glioblastoma,' 'biomarkers,' 'pharmacogenomics,' 'pharmacometabolomics,' 'pharmacometabonomics/pharmacometabolomics,' 'collaborative informatics,' and 'precision medicine.' A list of the top 4 insights we derived from this literature analysis is presented in this study. For example, we found that (i) tumor grading needs to be better refined, (ii) diagnostic precision should be improved, (iii) standardization in radiomics is lacking, and (iv) quantitative radiomics needs to prove clinical implementation. We conclude with an interdisciplinary call to the metabolomics, pharmacy/pharmacology, radiology, and surgery communities that pharmacometabolomics coupled to information technologies (chemoinformatics tools, databases, collaborative systems) can inform quantitative radiomics, thus translating Big Data and information growth to knowledge growth, rational drug development and diagnostics innovation for glioblastomas, and possibly in other brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28816643

Despite progress in characterizing the genetic and molecular mechanisms of glioblastomas, advances in treatment that translate into substantial improvement in prognosis have yet to be realized. A role for cytomegalovirus in glioblastoma pathogenesis was proposed more than a decade ago and has generated considerable debate as a possible therapeutic target. Independent groups have had variable success in detecting cytomegalovirus infection in tumor cells; the overall consensus is that very low levels of viral proteins and nucleic acids can be observed. Although cytomegalovirus has not been found to be oncogenic in this context, a possible oncomodulatory role has been suggested. A recent clinical trial evaluating valganciclovir as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on tumor growth or overall survival, although retrospective analysis subsequently indicted a significant survival benefit. In light of the publicity of that report, patients and neuro-oncologists are requesting cytomegalovirus testing to justify antiviral treatment. Based on questions on the significance of cytomegalovirus infection in glioblastomas and the lack of a clear clinical benefit of valganciclovir, we reviewed this topic and conclude that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing and treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25289896
"""Bevacizumab for glioblastoma: current indications, surgical implications, and future directions.""","""Initial enthusiasm after promising Phase II trials for treating recurrent glioblastomas with the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab—a neutralizing antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor—was tempered by recent Phase III trials showing no efficacy for treating newly diagnosed glioblastomas. As a result, there is uncertainty about the appropriate indications for the use of bevacizumab in glioblastoma treatment. There are also concerns about the effects of bevacizumab on wound healing that neurosurgeons must be aware of. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests a percentage of tumors treated with bevacizumab for an extended period of time will undergo transformation into a more biologically aggressive and invasive phenotype with a particularly poor prognosis. Despite these concerns, there remain numerous examples of radiological and clinical improvement after bevacizumab treatment, particularly in patients with recurrent glioblastoma with limited therapeutic options. In this paper, the authors review clinical results with bevacizumab for glioblastoma treatment to date, ongoing trials designed to address unanswered questions, current clinical indications based on existing data, neurosurgical implications of bevacizumab use in patients with glioblastoma, the current scientific understanding of the tumor response to short- and long-term bevacizumab treatment, and future studies that will need to be undertaken to enable this treatment to fulfill its therapeutic promise for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581938
"""GZ17-6.02 Inhibits the Growth of EGFRvIII+ Glioblastoma.""","""Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is amplified in over 50% of glioblastomas and promotes tumor formation and progression. However, attempts to treat glioblastoma with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been unsuccessful thus far. The current standard of care is especially poor in patients with a constitutively active form of EGFR, EGFRvIII, which is associated with shorter survival time. This study examined the effect of GZ17-6.02, a novel anti-cancer agent undergoing phase 1 studies, on two EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma stem cells: D10-0171 and D317. In vitro analyses showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibited the growth of both D10-0171 and D317 cells with IC50 values of 24.84 and 28.28 µg/mL respectively. RNA sequencing and reverse phase protein array analyses revealed that GZ17-6.02 downregulates pathways primarily related to steroid synthesis and cell cycle progression. Interestingly, G17-6.02's mechanism of action involves the downregulation of the recently identified glioblastoma super-enhancer genes WSCD1, EVOL2, and KLHDC8A. Finally, a subcutaneous xenograft model showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibits glioblastoma growth in vivo. We conclude that GZ17-6.02 is a promising combination drug effective at inhibiting the growth of a subset of glioblastomas and our data warrants further preclinical studies utilizing xenograft models to identify patients that may respond to this drug.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456993

Malignant gliomas such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) present some of the greatest challenges in the management of cancer patients worldwide, despite notable recent achievements in oncology. Even with aggressive surgical resections using state-of-the-art preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, along with recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains dismal: survival after diagnosis is about 1 year. Established prognostic factors are limited, but include age, Karnofsky performance status, mini-mental status examination score, O6-methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation and extent of surgery. Standard treatment includes resection of > 95% of the tumor, followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Nevertheless, GBM research is being conducted worldwide at a remarkable pace, in the laboratory and at the bedside, with some of the more recent promising studies focused on identification of aberrant genetic events and signaling pathways to develop molecular-based targeted therapies, tumor stem cell identification and characterization, modulation of tumor immunological responses and understanding of the rare long-term survivors.

"""Glioblastoma Molecular Classification Tool Based on mRNA Analysis: From Wet-Lab to Subtype.""","""Most glioblastoma studies incorporate the layer of tumor molecular subtype based on the four-subtype classification system proposed in 2010. Nevertheless, there is no universally recognized and convenient tool for glioblastoma molecular subtyping, and each study applies a different set of markers and/or approaches that cause inconsistencies in data comparability and reproducibility between studies. Thus, this study aimed to create an applicable user-friendly tool for glioblastoma classification, with high accuracy, while using a significantly smaller number of variables. The study incorporated a TCGA microarray, sequencing datasets, and an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas (LUHS cohort). The models were constructed by applying the Agilent G4502 dataset, and they were tested using the Affymetrix HG-U133a and Illumina Hiseq cohorts, as well as the LUHS cases. Two classification models were constructed by applying a logistic regression classification algorithm, based on the mRNA levels of twenty selected genes. The classifiers were translated to a RT-qPCR assay and validated in an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas. The classification accuracy of the 20-gene and 5-gene classifiers varied between 90.7-91% and 85.9-87.7%, respectively. With this work, we propose a cost-efficient three-class (classical, mesenchymal, and proneural) tool for glioblastoma molecular classification based on the mRNA analysis of only 5-20 genes, and we provide the basic information for classification performance starting from the wet-lab stage. We hope that the proposed classification tool will enable data comparability between different research groups.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36555518
"""Necrosis and glioblastoma: a friend or a foe? A review and a hypothesis.""","""Objective: Two main forms of cell death are encountered in biology: apoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) and necrosis (i.e., accidental cell death). Because necrosis and apoptosis can lead to cell removal, one might intuit that they are both desirable in cancer treatment. However, in the setting of glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant brain tumor for which the presence of necrosis is an important diagnostic feature, clinical studies indicate that as the degree of necrosis advances, the patient's prognosis worsens. Despite the apparent importance of this form of cell death, the mechanism of development of necrosis in glioblastomas remains unelucidated. The purpose of this article is to try to resolve this dilemma by hypothesizing the mechanism of necrosis formation in these tumors. Methods: On the basis of an extensive review of the literature, we present a hypothesis for the mechanism of necrosis formation in glioblastoma multiforme. Results: One of the many possible pathways leading to necrosis formation may involve increased tumor cell secretion of tumor necrosis factor. Procoagulation and antiapoptotic mechanisms resulting from certain pathways could prevent the completion of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis and could promote necrosis as the final mode of cell death. Such a hypothesis would explain the inverse correlation that exists between tumor necrosis and the survival of patients with glioblastomas, because the hypoxia that results from procoagulation selects for tumor cells that are more aggressive and more resistant to apoptosis-inducing therapies. Conclusion: A complete understanding of the series of events surrounding necrosis development in glioblastomas that is evidence-based is likely to provide targets for future therapies. On the basis of the potential mechanisms of development of necrosis described in this article, we postulate that effective therapies may have to be directed against the pathways that result in the formation of necrosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12182418
"""Role of micro-RNA (miRNA) in pathogenesis of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a very lethal form of human brain cancer, which is characterized by rapid diffuse, infiltrative growth and high level of cellular heterogeneity. Such cancer patients usually survive for one year under treatment. Recently, the role of small non-coding RNA known as microRNAs (miRNA), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, as miRNAs play a critical role in the tumor-forming processes. The change in expression levels of several miRNAs has been found in GBM patients within last 10 years. It is evident now that impairment of miRNA regulation is one of the key mechanisms in GBM pathogenesis. The miRNA deregulation is involved in many processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, invasion, glioma stem cell behavior, and angiogenesis. GBM is also known as Grade IV astrocytoma, a rare disease with an incidence of 2-3 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and North America, and 50% with GBM die within 1 year, while 90% within 3 years.

"""A Syx-RhoA-Dia1 signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive tumors that lack effective treatments. Here, we show that the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx promotes GBM cell growth both in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts derived from patients with GBM. Growth defects upon Syx depletion are attributed to prolonged mitosis, increased DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis, mediated by altered mRNA and protein expression of various cell cycle regulators. These effects are phenocopied by depletion of the Rho downstream effector Dia1 and are due, at least in part, to increased phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and reduced activity of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. Furthermore, targeting Syx signaling cooperates with radiation treatment and temozolomide (TMZ) to decrease viability in GBM cells, irrespective of their inherent response to TMZ. The data indicate that a Syx-RhoA-Dia1-YAP/TAZ signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in GBM and argue for its targeting for cancer treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427593

The drug was injected intracranially in a single dose. The following parameters were analyzed in vivo using MRI orex vivo using conventional assays: tumor growth, survival, cerebral and tumor perfusion, tumor cell density, tissue redox-state, and expression of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX).Results: Q0/A markedly suppressed tumor growth and significantly increased survival of glioblastoma mice. This was accompanied by increased oxidative stress in the tumor but not in non-cancerous tissues, increased tumor blood flow, and downregulation of tNOX. The redox-modulating and anticancer effects of Q0/A were more pronounced than those of menadione/ascorbate (M/A) obtained in our previous study. No adverse drug-related side-effects were observed in glioblastoma mice treated with Q0/A.Discussion: Q0/A differentiated cancer cells and tissues, particularly glioblastoma, from normal ones by redox targeting, causing a severe oxidative stress in the tumor but not in non-cancerous tissues. Q0/A had a pronounced anticancer activity and could be considered safe for the organism within certain concentration limits.

"""Baseballs, tennis balls, livestock farm manure, the IDH1 mutation, endothelial cell proliferation and hypoxic pseudopalisading (granulomatous) necrosis: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and the epidemiology, cellular metabolism and histology of diffuse gliomas, including glioblastoma.""","""An increased rate of diffuse gliomas, including glioblastoma, has been noted in livestock farmers in Western countries. Some researchers have suggested that a zoonotic virus or bacteria present in the livestock animal's feces or manure may be a possible etiologic factor. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), the cause of a chronic enteropathy in domestic livestock and a probable zoonosis, is heavily excreted in an infected animal's feces or manure, contaminating soil and ground on the animal's farm. Once excreted in an animal's feces, MAP lasts indefinitely in a dormant but viable form, and easily spreads outside farms to the surrounding environment. MAP's presence throughout the soil in countries where MAP infection of domestic livestock is extensive and long-standing may explain the increased rates of glioblastoma in tennis and baseball players who handle balls coated with MAP-contaminated dirt. MAP infection is consistent with glioblastoma's two defining histopathologic characteristics: endothelial cell proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. MAP is a non-tuberculous or atypical mycobacterium, which can cause hypoxic necrotizing granulomas, granulomas that resemble areas of pseudopalisading necrosis. There are known bacterial causes of endothelial cell proliferation. Almost unique amongst intracellular bacteria, MAP's variant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) enzyme, a type 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, can use a host cell's cytosolic α-ketoglutarate in its own Krebs or tricarboxylic acid cycle. MAP's ability to use a host cell's α-ketoglutarate may explain the survival advantage of the cytosolic IDH1 enzyme mutation for patients with diffuse gliomas including glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligdendroglioma, a mutation that results in a reduced supply of cytosolic α-ketoglutarate. MAP may therefore be one possible infectious cause of glioblastoma and the other histologic categories of diffuse glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31086759
"""Glioblastoma metastases: a literature review and a description of six clinical observations.""","""Introduction: since the 1990s, the literature has described cases of glioblastoma metastases with the development of foci located at a distance from the primary tumor. However, the pathogenesis of this process remains unclear until the end. This focus is believed to result, on the one hand, from tumor metastasis from the primary site and, on the other hand, from multifocal growth. This article presents a literature review and a description of clinical observations of patients with glioblastoma metastases. Material and methods: The study included 6 patients (1 female and 5 males) with brain glioblastomas who received treatment at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute (5 patients) and the Department of Neurosurgery of the Research Center of Neurology (1 patient) in the period from 2010 to 2014. Neurophysiological control was used if the tumor was localized near the eloquent cortical areas and pathways; 4 of 6 patients were operated on using the methods of intraoperative fluorescence diagnosis (5-ALA agent--Alasens). Results: Four patients had metastases within one hemisphere, two had metastases in the contralateral hemisphere in the period of 5 to 18 months after the first operation. The primary tumor site was located near the ventricular system in two patients. In one patient, the lateral ventricle was opened during the first operation. In another patient, the prepontine cistern was opened during the first operation. In two patients, the primary tumor site was located at a distance from the lateral ventricles, however, the tumor was located near them during recurrence. Based on metabolic navigation, fluorescence of the tumor was observed in the four patients during both the first and repeated operations. Conclusions: The close relationship between primary glioblastomas and metastases and the cerebrospinal fluid circulation pathways may confirm the fact of dissemination of tumor cells with cerebrospinal fluid flow. In our opinion, there should be an increased suspicion of the possibility for metastases of glioblastomas that are closely associated with the cerebrospinal fluid circulation pathways. Metabolic navigation with 5-ALA is effective both during primary surgery in patients with glioblastomas and during resection of glioblastoma metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26146042
"""Epigenetically regulated lncRNAs dissect the intratumoural heterogeneity and facilitate immune evasion of glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors that occupied a highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TIME). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose expression can be modified by DNA methylation, are emerging as critical regulators in the immune system. However, knowledge about the epigenetic changes in lncRNAs and their contribution to the immune heterogeneity of glioma is still lacking. Methods: In this study, we integrated paired methylome and transcriptome datasets of glioblastomas and identified 2 robust immune subtypes based on lncRNA methylation features. The immune characteristics of glioma subtypes were compared. Furthermore, immune-related lncRNAs were identified and their relationships with immune evasion were evaluated. Results: Glioma immunophenotypes exhibited distinct immune-related characteristics as well as clinical and epigenetic features. 149 epigenetically regulated (ER) lncRNAs were recognized that possessed inverse variation in epigenetic and transcriptional levels between glioma subtypes. Immune-related lncRNAs were further identified through the investigation of their correlation with immune cell infiltrations and immune-related pathways. In particular, the 'Hot' glioma subtype with higher immunoactivity while a worse survival outcome was found to character immune evasion features. We finally prioritized candidate ER lncRNAs associated with immune evasion markers and response to glioma immunotherapy. Among them, CD109-AS1 and LINC02447 were validated as novel immunoevasive biomarkers for glioma through in vitro experiments. Conclusion: In summary, our study systematically reveals the crosstalk among DNA methylation, lncRNA, and immune regulation in glioblastomas, and will facilitate the development of epigenetic immunotherapy approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37056564

However, the risk of developing subsequent primary glioblastoma (SPGBM) in patients with a prior cancer history is poorly understood. Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and identified patients diagnosed with non-CNS malignancy between 2000 and 2018. We calculated a modified standardized incidence ratio (M-SIR), defined as the ratio of the incidence of SPGBM among patients with initial non-CNS malignancy to the incidence of GBM in the general population, stratified by sex latency, and initial tumor location. Results: Of the 5,326,172 patients diagnosed with a primary non-CNS malignancy, 3559 patients developed SPGBM (0.07%). Among patients with SPGBM, 2312 (65.0%) were men, compared to 2,706,933 (50.8%) men in the total primary non-CNS malignancy cohort. The median age at diagnosis of SPGBM was 65 years. The mean latency between a prior non-CNS malignancy and developing a SPGBM was 67.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 27-100). Overall, patients with a primary non-CNS malignancy had a significantly elevated M-SIR (1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.16), with a 13% increased incidence of SPGBM when compared to the incidence of developing GBM in the age-matched general population. When stratified by non-CNS tumor location, patients diagnosed with primary melanoma, lymphoma, prostate, breast, renal, or endocrine malignancies had a higher M-SIR (M-SIR ranges: 1.09-2.15). Patients with lung cancers (M-SIR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-0.99), or stomach cancers (M-SIR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.82) demonstrated a lower M-SIR. Conclusion: Patients with a history of prior non-CNS malignancy are at an overall increased risk of developing SPGBM relative to the incidence of developing GBM in the general population. However, the incidence of SPGBM after prior non-CNS malignancy varies by primary tumor location, with some non-CNS malignancies demonstrating either increased or decreased predisposition for SPGBM depending on tumor origin.

It seems clear that in order to kill aggressive glioma cells more efficiently and with fewer side effects on normal tissue, there must be a shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. Since the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in almost 50% of glioblastomas, it currently represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets. In fact, it has been associated with several distinct steps in tumorigenesis, from tumor initiation to tumor growth and survival, and also with the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. However, inhibitors of the EGFR kinase have produced poor results with this type of cancer in clinical trials, with no clear explanation for the tumor resistance observed. Here we will review what we know about the expression and function of EGFR in cancer and in particular in gliomas.

This study aimed to determine the utility of the HFRS in predicting surgical outcomes after resection of glioblastoma (GBM) and compare its prognostic ability with other validated indices such as American Society of Anesthesiologists score and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using a GBM patient database (2017-2019) at a single institution. HFRS was calculated using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Bivariate logistic regression was used to model prognostic ability of each frailty index, and model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to assess for significant associations between HFRS and continuous and binary postoperative outcomes, respectively. Results: The study included 263 patients with GBM. The HFRS had a significantly greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared with American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P = 0.016) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (P = 0.037) for predicting 30-day readmission. On multivariate analysis, the HFRS was significantly and independently associated with hospital length of stay (P = 0.0038), nonroutine discharge (P = 0.018), and 30-day readmission (P = 0.0051). Conclusions: The HFRS has utility in predicting postoperative outcomes for patients with GBM and more effectively predicts 30-day readmission than other frailty indices. The HFRS may be used as a tool for optimizing clinical decision making to reduce adverse postoperative outcomes in patients with GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38211815
"""Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and glioblastoma.""","""The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is high for patients with brain tumors (11-20 %). Glioblastoma (GBM) patients, in particular, have the highest risk of VTE (24-30 %). The Khorana scale is the most commonly used clinical scale to evaluate the risk of VTE in cancer patients but its efficacy in patients with GBM remains unclear. The aim of this study is to estimate the frequency of VTE in GBM patients and identify potential risk factors for the development of VTE during adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, we intend to examine whether the Khorana scale accurately predicts the risk of VTE in GBM patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of GBM patients treated at MD Anderson during the years 2005-2011. The study cohort included 440 patients of which 64 (14.5 %) developed VTE after the start of adjuvant treatment. The median time to develop VTE was 6.5 months from the start of adjuvant treatment. On multivariate analysis male sex, BMI ≥ 35, KPS ≤ 80, history of VTE and steroid therapy were significantly associated with the development of VTE. The Khorana scale was found to be an invalid VTE predictive model in GBM patients due to poor specificity. Of the 64 patients who developed a VTE, 36 were treated with anticoagulation, 2 with an IVC filter, and 21 with both. Complications (intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding in other organs and thrombocytopenia) secondary to anticoagulation were reported in 16 % (n = 10). VTE is common in patients with GBM. Our results did not validate the Khorana scale in GBM patients. Additional studies identifying which GBM patients are at highest risk for VTE are needed to enable further evaluation of VTE preventive measures in this selected group.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25985958

"""Venous thromboembolic events in glioblastoma patients: An epidemiological study.""","""Background and purpose: Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) are a major complication in cancer patients, and therefore, also in brain cancer patients, anticoagulants are considered appropriate in the treatment of VTEs. Methods: Frequency, risk factors, and treatment of VTEs, as well as associated complications, were assessed in a population-based cohort of glioblastoma patients in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Correlations between clinical data and survival were retrospectively analyzed using the log-rank test and Cox regression models. Results: Four hundred fourteen glioblastoma patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type status were identified. VTEs were documented in 65 patients (15.7%). Median time from tumor diagnosis to the occurrence of a VTE was 1.8 months, and 27 patients were diagnosed with VTEs postoperatively (within 35 days; 42.2%). History of a prior VTE was more common in patients who developed VTEs than in those who did not (p = 0.004). Bevacizumab treatment at any time during the disease course was not associated with occurrence of VTEs (p = 0.593). Most patients with VTEs (n = 61, 93.8%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. Complications occurred in 14 patients (23.0%), mainly intracranial hemorrhages (n = 7, 11.5%). Overall survival did not differ between patients diagnosed with VTEs and those who had no VTE (p = 0.139). Tumor progression was the major cause of death (n = 283, 90.7%), and only three patients (1.0%) died in association with acute VTEs. Conclusions: Venous thromboembolic events occurred early in the disease course, suggesting that the implementation of primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during first-line chemoradiotherapy could be explored in a randomized setting.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35545894
"""Insular glioblastoma: surgical challenges, survival outcomes and prognostic factors.""","""Background: Insular gliomas are unique, challenging and evoke a lot of interest amongst neurosurgeons. Publications on insular glioma generally focus on the surgical intricacies and extent of resection pertaining to the low-grade gliomas. Insular glioblastomas (iGBM) have not been analysed separately before. Methods: Histologically proven WHO grade IV gliomas involving the insula over a 9-year period were studied. Their clinical presentation, radiological features, surgical findings and survival outcomes were assessed. Statistical methods were used to determine the favourable predictors of survival. Results: Out of 27 patients (M:F = 2.9:1), 18 (66%) patients had a tumour extension beyond the insula, 10 (37%) of whom had basal ganglia involvement. Total, near total and subtotal excisions were performed in 7 (26%), 9 (33%) and 11 (40.7%) patients, respectively. Twenty-three patients had glioblastoma, while four had gliosarcoma. IDH mutation was negative in six of the seven patients where it was done. Median overall survival was 5 months. Multivariate analysis showed that a female gender (p = 0.013), seizures in the preoperative period (p = 0.048) and completion of adjuvant therapy (p = 0.003) were associated with a longer survival. Conclusion: Insular glioblastomas have a poor prognosis. Insular location and certain tumour characteristics often limit the extent of resection of iGBMs. Moreover, postoperative complications sometimes negate the advantages of a radical resection. A female gender, presentation with seizures and completion of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy appear to be good prognostic factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356607

"""Role of microRNAs in mechanisms of glioblastoma resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.""","""Low-grade gliomas and multiform glioblastoma are characterized by highly pronounced anaplasia, malignization, proliferation, and invasiveness; moreover, they are highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. The very low efficiency of traditional approaches in the treatment of patients with glioblastomas is due to the intensive invasive growth of the tumor resulting in deep infiltration of adjacent normal perivascular and nervous tissue and formation of areas of perineural infiltration differently remote from the tumor epicenter. MicroRNAs are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene activities, and their expression is markedly increased in tumors, in particular in gliomas. MicroRNAs have been shown to promote the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of tumor stem and non-stem cells. However, a population of microRNA possessing antitumor effects is also detected in gliomas. As a rule, the expression of antitumor microRNAs is suppressed in tumors. In this review, we consider microRNAs, their influence on radio- and chemoresistance of gliomas, and prospects for their use as specific agents in targeted therapy of gliomas. The pool of these microRNAs has distinct therapeutic value, because on use in combined therapy it can decrease the resistance of glioma tumor stem cells to existing pharmaceuticals and improve the efficiency of radio- and chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23590435
"""An inflammatory gene-related prognostic risk score model for prognosis and immune infiltration in glioblastoma.""","""This study aimed to screen for key genes related to the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). First, bioinformatics analysis was performed based on databases such as TCGA and MSigDB. Inflammatory-related genes were obtained from the MSigDB database. The TCGA-tumor samples were divided into cluster A and B groups based on consensus clustering. Multivariate Cox regression was applied to construct the risk score model of inflammatory-related genes based on the TCGA database. Second, to understand the effects of model characteristic genes on GBM cells, U-87 MG cells were used for knockdown experiments, which are important means for studying gene function. PLAUR is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker for patients with glioma. Therefore, the model characteristic gene PLAUR was selected for knockdown experiments. The prognosis of cluster A was significantly better than that of cluster B. The verification results also demonstrate that the risk score could predict overall survival. Although the immune cells in cluster B and high-risk groups increased, no matching survival advantage was observed. It may be that stromal activation inhibits the antitumor effect of immune cells. PLAUR knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted tumor cell apoptosis. In conclusion, a prognostic prediction model for GBM composed of inflammatory-related genes was successfully constructed. Increased immune cell expression may be linked to a poor prognosis for GBM, as stromal activation decreased the antitumor activity of immune cells in cluster B and high-risk groups. PLAUR may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37947182

In glioblastoma multiforme, the most prevalent primary brain cancer and an incurable tumor with a median survival time of 15 months, a single epigenetic modification, the methylation of the O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene, is a valid biomarker for predicting response to therapy with alkylating agents and also, independently, prognosis. More recently, the progress from single gene to whole-genome analysis of DNA methylation has allowed a better subclassification of glioblastomas. Here, we review the clinically relevant information that can be obtained by studying MGMT gene and whole-genome DNA methylation changes in glioblastomas, also highlighting benefits, including those of liquid biopsy, and pitfalls of the different detection methods.

"""The inverse paradigm and the ancestral cell of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.""","""Rethinking IDH-wildtype glioblastoma through its unique features can help researchers find innovative and effective treatments. It is currently emerging that, after decades of therapeutic impasse, some traditional concepts regarding IDH-wildtype glioblastoma need to be supplemented and updated to overcome therapeutic resistance. Indeed, multiple clinical aspects and recent indirect and direct experimental data are providing evidence that the supratentorial brain parenchyma becomes entirely and quiescently micro-infiltrated long before primary tumor bulk growth. Furthermore, they are indicating that the known micro-infiltration that occurs during the IDH-wildtype glioblastoma growth and evolution is not at the origin of distant relapses. It follows that the ubiquitous supratentorial brain parenchyma micro-infiltration as a source for the development of widespread distant recurrences is actually due to the silent stage that precedes tumor growth rather than to the latter. All this implies that, in addition to the heterogeneity of the primary bulk, there is a second crucial cause of therapeutic resistance that has never hitherto been identified and challenged. In this regard, the ancestral founder cancer stem cell (CSC) appears as the key cell that can link the two causes of resistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34152549

Sequential preoperative examinations using fluorine-18-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) could depict the degree of glucose metabolism with hypoxic condition. However, molecular mechanism of glucose metabolism under hypoxia in glioblastoma has been unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the key molecules of hypoxic glucose metabolism. Methods: Using surgically obtained specimens, gene expressions associated with glucose metabolism were analyzed in patients with glioblastoma (n = 33) who underwent preoperative 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG PET to identify affected molecules according to hypoxic condition. Tumor in vivo metabolic activities were semiquantitatively evaluated by lesion-normal tissue ratio (LNR). Protein expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. To evaluate prognostic value, relationship between gene expression and overall survival was explored in another independent nonoverlapping clinical cohort (n = 17) and validated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (n = 167). Results: Among the genes involving glucose metabolic pathway, mRNA expression of glucose-6-phosphatase 3 (G6PC3) correlated with 18F-FDG LNR (P = 0.03). In addition, G6PC3 mRNA expression in 18F-FMISO high-accumulated glioblastomas was significantly higher than that in 18F-FMISO low-accumulated glioblastomas (P < 0.01). Protein expression of G6PC3 was consistent with mRNA expression, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. These findings indicated that the G6PC3 expression might be facilitated by hypoxic condition in glioblastomas. Next, we investigated the clinical relevance of G6PC3 in terms of prognosis. Among the glioblastoma patients who received gross total resection, mRNA expressions of G6PC3 in the patients with poor prognosis (less than 1-year survival) were significantly higher than that in the patients who survive more than 3 years. Moreover, high mRNA expression of G6PC3 was associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma, as validated by TCGA database. Conclusion: G6PC3 was affluently expressed in glioblastoma tissues with coincidentally high 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO accumulation. Further, it might work as a prognostic biomarker of glioblastoma. Therefore, G6PC3 is a potential key molecule of glucose metabolism under hypoxia in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38449509

Methods: Retrospective review was conducted of 841 glioblastoma patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2014, 64 (8%) of whom underwent VP shunting for symptomatic hydrocephalus, to analyze symptoms and outcomes after shunting. Overall survival and postshunt survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier methods, with predictors evaluated by use of Cox proportional hazards. Results: Of the 64 patients who underwent shunting, 42 (66%) had communicating hydrocephalus (CH) and 22 (34%) had obstructive hydrocephalus (OH). CH patients underwent more preshunt craniotomies than those with noncommunicating hydrocephalus, with a mean of 2.3 and 0.7 surgeries, respectively ( P < .001). Ventricular entry during craniotomy occurred in 52% of CH patients vs 59% of those with OH ( P = .8). After shunting, 61% of all patients achieved symptomatic improvement, which was not associated with hydrocephalus variant ( P > .99). Hydrocephalus symptom improvement rates were as follows: headache, 77%; lethargy, 61%; and altered cognition or memory, 54%. Symptomatic improvement was more likely in patients who were younger at shunt placement (hazard ratio, 0.96; P = .045). Symptomatic improvement, shorter time between glioblastoma diagnosis and shunt placement, and CH rather than OH led to improved postshunt survival (hazard ratio = 0.24-0.99; P = .01-.04).

MGMT promoter methylated tumors occur more frequently in the left temporal lobe, in young patients with glioblastoma, in IDH1 mutant tumors, in tumors having the proneural gene expression subtype, and in tumors lacking loss of PTEN occurring most frequently in the frontal lobe. MGMT methylated tumors with the IDH1 mutation tended to occur in the left frontal lobe. EGFR amplified and EGFR variant 3-expressing tumors occurred most frequently in the left temporal lobe. A similar region in the left temporal lobe was associated with favorable response to radiochemotherapy and increased survival. Conclusions: Radiographic atlases for specific phenotypes provide insight into overlap between prognostic variables and may help to identify niche locations for cancer cells of origin.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22997168
"""Epigenetic alterations in glioblastomas: Diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance.""","""Glioblastoma, the most common and heterogeneous tumor affecting brain parenchyma, is dismally characterized by a very poor prognosis. Thus, the search of new, more effective treatments is a vital need. Here, we will review the druggable epigenetic features of glioblastomas that are, indeed, currently explored in preclinical studies and in clinical trials for the development of more effective, personalized treatments. In detail, we will review the studies that have led to the identification of epigenetic signatures, IDH mutations, MGMT gene methylation, histone modification alterations, H3K27 mutations and epitranscriptome landscapes of glioblastomas, in each case discussing the corresponding targeted therapies and their potential efficacy. Finally, we will emphasize how recent technological improvements permit to routinely investigate many glioblastoma epigenetic biomarkers in clinical practice, further enforcing the hope that personalized drugs, targeting specific epigenetic features, could be in future a therapeutic option for selected patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36479695
"""Antiangiogenesis treatment for glioblastoma multiforme: challenges and opportunities.""","""Angiogenesis is a major hallmark of cancer cells, and glioblastomas are among the most angiogenic tumors. The cascade of angiogenesis is probably initiated by hypoxia, leading to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Both VEGF and bFGF have paracrine effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, or both, causing the formation of hyperpermeable tumor blood vessels. Advanced MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced, dynamic susceptibility, and arterial spin labeling MRI, have provided semiquantitative measurements of tumor vascular permeability and perfusion. A decrease in vascular permeability and perfusion can be detected after antiangiogenesis drug treatment, either with monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab that sequesters VEGF, or small-molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, antiangiogenesis therapies are being increasingly adopted for treating glioblastomas. However, caution must be exercised because neural stem cells are also sensitive to antiangiogenesis drugs and the combined effect of ionizing radiation. This article summarizes 30 years of laboratory and clinical research on glioblastoma angiogenesis and discusses its underlying biology, clinical trial results, vascular neuroimaging, and the potential side effects of antiangiogenesis treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18492463
"""Metabolic modulation of glioblastoma with dichloroacetate.""","""Solid tumors, including the aggressive primary brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme, develop resistance to cell death, in part as a result of a switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to cytoplasmic glycolysis. This metabolic remodeling is accompanied by mitochondrial hyperpolarization. We tested whether the small-molecule and orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) can reverse this cancer-specific metabolic and mitochondrial remodeling in glioblastoma. Freshly isolated glioblastomas from 49 patients showed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, which was rapidly reversed by DCA. In a separate experiment with five patients who had glioblastoma, we prospectively secured baseline and serial tumor tissue, developed patient-specific cell lines of glioblastoma and putative glioblastoma stem cells (CD133(+), nestin(+) cells), and treated each patient with oral DCA for up to 15 months. DCA depolarized mitochondria, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and induced apoptosis in GBM cells, as well as in putative GBM stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. DCA therapy also inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, promoted p53 activation, and suppressed angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The dose-limiting toxicity was a dose-dependent, reversible peripheral neuropathy, and there was no hematologic, hepatic, renal, or cardiac toxicity. Indications of clinical efficacy were present at a dose that did not cause peripheral neuropathy and at serum concentrations of DCA sufficient to inhibit the target enzyme of DCA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase II, which was highly expressed in all glioblastomas. Metabolic modulation may be a viable therapeutic approach in the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20463368
"""Early presentation of primary glioblastoma.""","""Background: Clinical and neuroimaging findings of glioblastomas (GBM) at an early stage have rarely been described and those tumors are most probably under-diagnosed. Furthermore, their genetic alterations, to our knowledge, have never been previously reported. Methods: We report the clinical as well as neuroimaging findings of four early cases of patients with GBM. Results: In our series, early stage GBM occurred at a mean age of 57 years. All patients had seizures as their first symptom. In all early stages, MRI showed a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequences and an enhancement on GdE-T1WI sequences. A hyperintense signal on diffusion sequences with a low ADC value was also found. These early observed occurrences of GBM developed rapidly and presented the MRI characteristics of classic GBM within a few weeks. The GBM size was multiplied by 32 in one month. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated the de novo nature of these tumors, i.e. absence of mutant IDH1 R132H protein expression, which is a diagnostic marker of low-grade diffuse glioma and secondary GBM. Conclusions: A better knowledge of early GBM presentation would allow a more suitable management of the patients and may improve their prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24856049

RANO (response assessment in neurooncology) criteria, including conventional MRI (cMRI), addressed the issues of pseudoprogression after radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy and pseudoresponse during antiangiogenic therapy of glioblastomas (GBM) and other gliomas. The development of cancer immunotherapy forced the identification of further relevant response criteria, summarized by the iRANO working group in 2015. In spite of this, the unequivocal definition of glioma progression by cMRI remains difficult particularly in the setting of immunotherapy approaches provided by checkpoint inhibitors and dendritic cells. Advanced MRI (aMRI) may in principle address this unmet clinical need.

There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies regarding the patient characteristics. The results of our systematic review are inconclusive; the available evidence does not definitely support or rule out an association between pre-operative peritumoral edema and survival.

"""Potential therapeutic implications of cancer stem cells in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor. Despite recent therapeutic advances in other cancers, the treatment of glioblastomas remains ineffective and essentially palliative. The treatment failure is a result of a number of causes, but we and others have demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) display relative resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs also contribute to tumor growth through the stimulation of angiogenesis, which has been shown to be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas. Cancer stem cells also have been hypothesized as a contributor to systemic metastases. While glioblastomas rarely metastasize beyond the central nervous system, glioblastomas invade into brain structures to prevent surgical cure and GSCs have an extremely invasive phenotype. Collectively, these studies and others suggest that GSCs may be important therapeutic targets not only to achieve cure but even reduce tumor relapse and improve overall survival. Many recent studies suggest that GSCs share core regulatory pathways with normal embryonic and somatic stem cells, but display important distinctions that provide clues into useful treatment targets. The cancer stem cell hypothesis may also modify our approaches in tumor imaging and biomarker development, but clinical validation waits. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of GSC biology with a focus on potential anti-GSC therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20457135

Five-year cancer specific survival data were obtained. Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze long-term survival outcomes and risk factors.Results: A total of 6586 patients were identified; 61.5% were men and 38.5% were women. The 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates in the male and female groups were 6.8% and 8.3%, respectively (P=0.002 by univariate and P<0.001 by multivariate analysis).

"""KLF6 depletion promotes NF-kappaB signaling in glioblastoma.""","""Dysregulation of the NF-κB transcription factor occurs in many cancer types. Krüppel-like family of transcription factors (KLFs) regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Here, we report a new mechanism of NF-κB activation in glioblastoma through depletion of the KLF6 tumor suppressor. We show that KLF6 transactivates multiple genes negatively controlling the NF-κB pathway and consequently reduces NF-κB nuclear localization and downregulates NF-κB targets. Reconstitution of KLF6 attenuates their malignant phenotype and induces neural-like differentiation and senescence, consistent with NF-κB pathway inhibition. KLF6 is heterozygously deleted in 74.5% of the analyzed glioblastomas and predicts unfavorable patient prognosis suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a clinically relevant means of evading KLF6-dependent regulation of NF-κB. Together, our study identifies a new mechanism by which KLF6 regulates NF-κB signaling, and how this mechanism is circumvented in glioblastoma through KLF6 loss.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28166199

The proportion of the classical subtype in recurrent ones (22%) was lower than that in primary glioblastoma (36%). The frequency of IDH1 mutations in recurrent glioblastomas was nearly twice that in primary glioblastomas. TP53 mutations were fewer in proneural recurrent glioblastomas (20%) but frequent in classical recurrent glioblastomas (80%). The most common sites of recurrent glioblastomas were the temporal lobe (41%). In patients diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, 64% were younger than 50 years. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that chromatin fracture, repair, and remodeling genes were enriched in recurrent glioblastoma.

We focused on the relationship of NSCs with glioblastoma, since we have discovered that recurrent glioblastomas were inclined to be derived from subventricular zone (SVZ), where NSCs reside. We want to clarify whether NSCs are involved in glioblastoma relapse. Methods: Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the stemness of NSCs. The Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to measure the proliferation of cells. Migration abilities were examined by wound healing and transwell assays, and tumor formation abilities were confirmed in nude mice. Results: We found in experiments that NSCs promoted proliferation of a glioblastoma cell line-Ln229, the migration ability of Ln229 cells was motivated by co-cultured with NSCs. Tumor formation of Ln229 cells was also accelerated in nude mice when co-transplanted with NSCs. In immunohistochemistry, we found that the Sox2- and Ki67-positive cells were much higher in co-transplanted groups than that of control groups. Conclusions: These results imply the potential role that NSCs play in speeding up tumor formation in the process of glioblastoma relapse, providing the basis for dealing with newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients, which may help postpone the recurrence of glioblastoma as far as possible through preprocessing the tumor-adjacent SVZ tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945128

CCK-8 was used to determine the inhibitory rate of Coix group, TMZ group and drug combination group on GBM cells, and the combination index (CI) was calculated to determine whether they had synergistic effect. Then RNA was extracted from each group, transcriptome sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The possible mechanism was analyzed by GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis. The CI of Coix and TMZ indicating a synergistic effect when TMZ concentration is 0.1 mg/ml and Coix concentration is 2 mg/ml. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that interferon (IFN) related genes were down-regulated by Coix and up-regulated by TMZ and combined drugs, however, the up-regulation induced by combined drugs was less than that of TMZ. Besides IFN related genes, cholesterol metabolism pathway were also been regulated. Coix and TMZ have synergistic effects in the treatment of GBM at certain doses. RNA-Seq results suggested that the abnormal on genetic materials caused by DNA damage induced by TMZ treatment can be sensed by IFN related genes and activates antiviral IFN signaling, causing the activation of repairing mechanism and drug resistance. Coix inhibits IFN related genes, thereby inhibits drug resistance of TMZ. In addition, the activation of ferroptosis and the regulation of DEGs in cholesterol metabolism pathway were also contributed to the synergistic effects of Coix and TMZ.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37726303
"""Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy.

Previously unrecognized molecular subsets and pathway profiles that convey predictive and prognostic information about individual cancer patients are being identified. Patients with glioblastoma, the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults, stand to benefit considerably from these advances. Recent data suggest that morphologically indistinguishable glioblastomas have distinct classes of causal oncogene activation, and that these subclasses may be targetable by oncogene/signaling pathway specific therapies. Oncogene/signaling pathway inhibitors show great promise for the treatment of patients with some types of cancer, but their clinical application for glioblastoma has been severely limited by an inability to determine which inhibitor is most likely to benefit a specific patient.

Among the isoform of OCT4B, OCT4B-190 (OCT4B19kDa) was highly expressed in human glioblastoma stem cells and glioblastoma cells and was mainly detected in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Overexpression of OCT4B19kDa promoted colony formation of glioblastoma cells when grown in soft agar culture conditions.

"""Mitigating temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma via DNA damage-repair inhibition.""","""Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers, with a 5 year survival rate below 25%. Temozolomide is typically used in glioblastoma treatment; however, the enzymes alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (APNG) and methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) efficiently mediate the repair of DNA damage caused by temozolomide, reducing treatment efficacy. Consequently, APNG and MGMT inhibition has been proposed as a way of overcoming chemotherapy resistance. Here, we develop a mechanistic mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the effects of chemotherapy on tumour cells, including the processes of DNA damage induction, cell arrest and DNA repair. Our model is carefully parametrized and validated, and then used to virtually recreate the response of heteroclonal glioblastomas to dual treatment with temozolomide and inhibitors of APNG/MGMT. Using our mechanistic model, we identify four combination treatment strategies optimized by tumour cell phenotype, and isolate the strategy most likely to succeed in a pre-clinical and clinical setting. If confirmed in clinical trials, these strategies have the potential to offset chemotherapy resistance in patients with glioblastoma and improve overall survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31964274

Methods: In this cohort study, all consecutive patients diagnosed with glioblastoma in two Dutch hospitals between February 2017 and August 2020 were included. Targeted DNA next-generation sequencing of all glioblastomas was performed for diagnostic purposes and included mutational status of the genes ATRX, BRAF, CIC, FUBP1, H3F3A, IDH1, IDH2, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 and amplification/gain or deletion of BRAF, CDKN2A, EGFR, NOTCH1 and PTEN. The primary outcome was VTE within three months before glioblastoma diagnosis until two years after. Cumulative incidences were determined using competing risk analysis adjusting for mortality. Univariable Cox regression analysis was performed to determine hazard ratios. Results: From 324 patients with glioblastoma, 25 were diagnosed with VTE. Patients with a CDKN2A deletion had a 12-month adjusted cumulative incidence of VTE of 12.5 % (95%CI: 7.3-19.3) compared with 5.4 % (95%CI: 2.6-9.6) in patients with CDKN2A wildtype (p = 0.020), corresponding to a HR of 2.53 (95%CI: 1.12-5.73, p = 0.026). No significant associations were found between any of the other investigated genes and VTE. Conclusion: This study suggests a potential role for CDKN2A deletion in glioblastoma-related VTE.

Fifty-seven patients with glioblastoma (25 newly-diagnosed/32 recurrent) were examined with GE- and SE-DSC perfusion sequences, and a quantitative blood-oxygen-level-dependent (qBOLD) approach. Maps of MVTH, µVTH and coefficient of variation (MCOV and µCOV) were calculated from GE- and SE-DSC data, respectively, using an extended flow-diffusion equation. PO2mit maps were calculated from qBOLD data. Newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma showed significantly lower ( P ≤ 0.001) µCOV values compared to both normal brain and macrovasculature (MCOV) of the lesions. Recurrent glioblastoma had significantly higher µVTH ( P = 0.014) and µCOV ( P = 0.039) as well as significantly lower PO2mit values ( P = 0.008) compared to newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. The macrovasculature, however, showed no significant differences. Our findings provide evidence of microvascular adaption in the disorganized tumor vasculature for retaining the metabolic demands in stress response of therapeutically-uncontrolled glioblastomas.

Patient demographics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics were collected and compared by patient readmission status using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors that predicted 30-day readmissions. Results: The cohort included 69 (12%) 30-day readmissions after 575 operations.

Results: Two hundred thirty-four patients underwent tumor resection (complete 26%, subtotal 29%, and partial 45%). One hundred twenty-seven underwent biopsy. Mean patient age was 61 years, and overall survival was 11.6 ± 12.1 months. The overall survival of elderly patients (9.1 ± 11.6 months) was significantly lower than that of younger patients (14.9 ± 16.7 months; p = 0.0001). Stratifying between resection or biopsy, age was a negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing biopsy (4.0 ± 7.1 vs 7.9 ± 8.7 months; p = 0.007), but not in patients undergoing tumor resection (13.0 ± 8.5 vs 13.3 ± 14.5 months; p = 0.86). Survival of elderly patients undergoing complete tumor resection was 17.7 ± 8.1 months. Conclusions: In this series of patients with glioblastoma, age was a prognostic factor in patients undergoing biopsy, but not in patients undergoing resection. Tumor location and patient clinical status may prohibit extensive resection, but resection should not be withheld from patients only on the basis of age. In elderly patients with glioblastoma, undergoing resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant therapies, is warranted.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21942727

"""Genetic pathways to glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas, the most frequent and malignant human brain tumors, may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). These glioblastoma subtypes constitute distinct disease entities that affect patients of different ages and develop through different genetic pathways. Our recent population-based study in the Canton of Zürich, Switzerland, shows that primary glioblastomas develop in older patients (mean age, 62 years) and typically show LOH on chromosome 10q (69%) and other genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, p16INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients (mean, 45 years) and frequently show TP53 mutations (65%) and LOH 10q (63%). Common to both primary and secondary glioblastoma is LOH on 10q, distal to the PTEN locus; a putative suppressor gene at 10q25-qter may be responsible for the glioblastoma phenotype. Of the TP53 point mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57% were located in hotspot codons 248 and 273, while in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more widely distributed. Furthermore, G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites were more frequent in secondary than in primary glioblastomas (56% vs 30%). These data suggest that the TP53 mutations in these glioblastoma subtypes arise through different mechanisms. There is evidence that G:C-->A:T transition mutations at CpG sites in the TP53 gene are significantly more frequent in low-grade astrocytomas with promoter methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene than in those without methylation. This suggests that, in addition to deamination of 5-methylcytosine (the best known mechanism of formation of G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites), involvement of alkylating agents that produce O6-methylguanine or related adducts recognized by MGMT cannot be excluded in the pathway leading to secondary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15822813
"""Glioblastoma multiforme presenting with ischemic stroke: case report and review of the literature.""","""A 58-year-old woman presented with acute onset of global aphasia. Imaging studies revealed a left frontotemporal enhancing tumor and ischemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. The patient was operated on, and the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme was confirmed. At the time of surgery, several branches of the left middle cerebral artery were found embedded in the tumor. One branch, which was infiltrated by tumor and completely occluded, was resected to achieve complete resection. Postoperatively, the stroke area within the middle cerebral artery territory increased, together with worsening of the patient's clinical status, thus requiring urgent decompressive craniectomy. Thereafter, the patient gradually improved, and received radiation therapy and chemotherapy with no recurrence after 24 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, glioblastomas presenting with ischemic stroke are rare, and such patients should be considered to be at high surgical risk.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21489628
"""Surgical Resection of Anterior and Posterior Butterfly Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Evidence suggests a survival benefit for patients with glioblastoma who undergo maximal safe surgical resection. Not all glioblastomas are amenable to surgical resection and anatomic location is one potentially limiting factor. Glioblastomas that invade the corpus callosum and cross midline to the contralateral hemisphere-butterfly glioblastomas (bGBMs)-are one subgroup of tumors traditionally deemed inoperable. Methods: We evaluate the management of bGBMs at our institution to assess whether surgical resection is feasible, safe, and more effective than biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed our institutional brain tumor registry for all adult patients treated for glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV) between 2004 and 2016 to identify all bGBMs. Results: Survival between biopsy and resection was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier model. Twenty-nine (3.8%) of 764 newly diagnosed GBMs were identified as bGBM. Of these, 9 patients (31.0%) underwent surgical resection and 20 patients (69.0%) underwent biopsy. Five patients (55.6%) in the surgical resection group had 98% extent of resection or greater. Median survival of our entire cohort of patients was 3.3 months. Median survival was higher in the surgical resection groups (7.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.0019). Increased age is independently associated with increased risk of death, and adjuvant therapy is independently associated with prolonged survival. Conclusions: Surgical resection of butterfly glioblastoma prolongs survival without increased risk of permanent neurologic deficit. Both anterior and posterior bGBMs can be resected safely.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29162526

However, their incidence, clinical characteristics, and prognostic implications are less well characterized. Objective: This study was undertaken to provide a contemporary experience along with benchmark data relevant to the above in patients with glioblastoma. It also sought to reexplore improved survival with seizures, as observed by others. Methods: In this single-institution study, patients with glioblastoma from 2010 through 2014 had their medical records reviewed in detail. Results: Among 122 patients, 58 (48%) had a seizure history. Of these, 67% had more than 1, 41% had generalized seizures, and most received antiseizure medication (most commonly levetiracetam). The median survival for patients with seizures was 1.66 years and 0.87 years for those without (hazard ratio for risk of death with seizures: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.43, 1.21; P = .22 by the log-rank test).

"""Systemic metastasis in glioblastoma may represent the emergence of neoplastic subclones.""","""Glioblastomas only rarely metastasize to sites outside the central nervous system, for reasons that are poorly understood. We report the clinicopathological and molecular genetic findings in 6 patients with metastatic glioblastoma. Four patients were under the age of 32 and all but 1 patient died within 2 yr of diagnosis. The number of metastases ranged from 1 to 3. At the time of death, 3 patients had apparent tumor control at their primary site. We evaluated DNA from both primary and metastatic glioblastomas for genetic alterations commonly found in glioblastomas: TP53 mutations, CDKN2A/p16 deletions, EGFR amplification, and allelic loss of chromosomes 1p, 10q and 19q. Four of 6 cases had TP53 mutations and only single cases had EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/p16 deletions, or allelic loss of 1p, 10q and 19q; 2 cases had no detectable genetic alterations. In 2 cases, the primary and metastatic tumors had identical genotypes. Remarkably, however, 2 cases had different TP53 alterations in the primary and metastatic lesions, or among the metastatic tumors, which suggests that some metastatic deposits may represent emergence of subclones that were not necessarily dominant in the primary tumor. The present observations and a review of the recent literature demonstrate that metastatic glioblastomas tend to occur in younger adults who do not follow long clinical courses, and may be characterized by TP53 mutations and differential clonal selection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11138924

Several prediction models have been produced to aid in prognosis assessment. Age, a primary decision factor for prognosis, is associated with increased genomic alterations, however the exact link between increased age and poor prognosis is unknown. Objective: In this study, we aimed to reveal the underlying cause of poor prognosis in elderly patients. Methods: This study included data on 616 primary GBM tumor samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases and 41 nontumor brain tissue samples obtained from GSE53890. Hallmarks and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated in both tumor and nontumor brain tissues. The association between choice of treatment regimen and age was measured using ANOVA and Student's t test. Results: Age was a robust predictor of poor prognosis in glioma. No age-related hallmarks of cancer were detected, including pathological characteristics or mutations. However, treatment choice was strongly significantly different between old and young patients. Combined chemo-radiation therapy could benefit old and young GBM patients, however, old patients are currently less likely to choose it. Conclusion: The vast divergence in prognosis between young and old GBM patients is largely caused by choice of treatment rather than age-related tumor genomic characteristics.

Samples in the current study were extracted from the ImmPort and TCGA databases to identify immune-related genes affecting GBM prognosis. A total of 92 immune-related genes displaying a significant correlation with prognosis were mined, and a shrinkage estimate was conducted on them. Among them, the 14 most representative genes showed a marked correlation with patient prognosis, and LASSO and stepwise regression analysis was carried out to further identify the genes for the construction of a predictive GBM prognosis model. Then, samples in training and test cohorts were incorporated into the model and divided to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the model to predict and classify the prognosis of patients and to identify the relevant immune features according to the median value of RiskScore (namely, Risk-H and Risk-L).

"""LGALS3 Promotes Treatment Resistance in Glioblastoma and Is Associated with Tumor Risk and Prognosis.""","""Background: LGALS3 promotes tumor progression in diverse cancers. However, the involvement of LGALS3 in glioblastoma has not yet been broadly illuminated. Methods: Microarray was performed to detect the gene expression profiles of radioresistance in T98G cells and identified a universally upregulated gene, LGALS3. The impact of LGALS3 on the survival of glioblastoma cells facing ionizing irradiation or temozolomide was investigated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). A total of 120 glioblastoma cases were collected to analyze the relationship between LGALS3 expression and patient prognosis. Another 961 patients with glioma and 1,351 healthy controls were recruited to study the association of SNPs across the LGALS3 gene with glioblastoma susceptibility. The functional SNP sites were also studied in cellular experiments. Results: An effective protection of LGALS3 from ionizing irradiation or temozolomide-induced cell death in T98G and U251 cells was found. In addition, high expression of LGALS3 could work as an independent risk factor for survival of patients with glioblastoma. Two SNP sites (rs4644 and rs4652) across the LGALS3 gene were associated with increased risk for glioblastoma, and the C allele of rs4652 and the A allele of rs4644 could enhance glioblastoma resistance to radio-chemotherapy, but not cell proliferation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that LGALS3 is an important biomarker influencing glioblastoma risk and prognosis and a potential target for treating the malignancy, especially ones with resistance against the standard therapy. Impact: LGALS3 promotes glioblastoma cells' resistance to ionizing irradiation and temozolomide and predicts poor prognosis. Targeting LGALS3 may limit the therapeutic resistance in glioblastoma and increase patient survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30341098
"""Identification of genomic biomarkers and their pathway crosstalks for deciphering mechanistic links in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a grade IV pernicious neoplasm occurring in the supratentorial region of brain. As its causes are largely unknown, it is essential to understand its dynamics at the molecular level. This necessitates the identification of better diagnostic and prognostic molecular candidates. Blood-based liquid biopsies are emerging as a novel tool for cancer biomarker discovery, guiding the treatment and improving its early detection based on their tumour origin. There exist previous studies focusing on the identification of tumour-based biomarkers for glioblastoma. However, these biomarkers inadequately represent the underlying pathological state and incompletely illustrate the tumour because of non-recursive nature of this approach to monitor the disease. Also, contrary to the tumour biopsies, liquid biopsies are non-invasive and can be performed at any interval during the disease span to surveil the disease. Therefore, in this study, a unique dataset of blood-based liquid biopsies obtained primarily from tumour-educated blood platelets (TEP) is utilised. This RNA-seq data from ArrayExpress is acquired comprising human cohort with 39 glioblastoma subjects and 43 healthy subjects. Canonical and machine learning approaches are applied for identification of the genomic biomarkers for glioblastoma and their crosstalks. In our study, 97 genes appeared enriched in 7 oncogenic pathways (RAF-MAPK, P53, PRC2-EZH2, YAP conserved, MEK-MAPK, ErbB2 and STK33 signalling pathways) using GSEA, out of which 17 have been identified participating actively in crosstalks. Using PCA, 42 genes are found enriched in 7 pathways (cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, translation factors, electron transport chain, ribosome, Huntington's disease, primary immunodeficiency pathways, and interferon type I signalling pathway) harbouring tumour when altered, out of which 25 actively participate in crosstalks. All the 14 pathways foster well-known cancer hallmarks and the identified DEGs can serve as genomic biomarkers, not only for the diagnosis and prognosis of Glioblastoma but also in providing a molecular foothold for oncogenic decision making in order to fathom the disease dynamics. Moreover, SNP analysis for the identified DEGs is performed to investigate their roles in disease dynamics in an elaborated manner. These results suggest that TEPs are capable of providing disease insights just like tumour cells with an advantage of being extracted anytime during the course of disease in order to monitor it.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37277696
"""Molecular landscape of IDH-mutant primary astrocytoma Grade IV/glioblastomas.""","""WHO 2016 classified glioblastomas into IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype with the former having a better prognosis but there was no study on IDH-mutant primary glioblastomas only, as previous series included secondary glioblastomas. We recruited a series of 67 IDH-mutant primary glioblastomas/astrocytoma IV without a prior low-grade astrocytoma and examined them using DNA-methylation profiling, targeted sequencing, RNA sequencing and TERT promoter sequencing, and correlated the molecular findings with clinical parameters. The median OS of 39.4 months of 64 cases and PFS of 25.9 months of 57 cases were better than the survival data of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and IDH-mutant secondary glioblastomas retrieved from datasets. The molecular features often seen in glioblastomas, such as EGFR amplification, combined +7/-10, and TERT promoter mutations were only observed in 6/53 (11.3%), 4/53 (7.5%), and 2/67 (3.0%) cases, respectively, and gene fusions were found only in two cases. The main mechanism for telomere maintenance appeared to be alternative lengthening of telomeres as ATRX mutation was found in 34/53 (64.2%) cases. In t-SNE analyses of DNA-methylation profiles, with an exceptional of one case, a majority of our cases clustered to IDH-mutant high-grade astrocytoma subclass (40/53; 75.5%) and the rest to IDH-mutant astrocytoma subclass (12/53; 22.6%). The latter was also enriched with G-CIMP high cases (12/12; 100%). G-CIMP-high status and MGMT promoter methylation were independent good prognosticators for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.002, respectively) and TP53 mutation was an independent poor prognosticator (p = 0.013) when correlated with other clinical parameters. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B was not correlated with OS (p = 0.197) and PFS (p = 0.278). PDGFRA amplification or mutation was found in 16/59 (27.1%) of cases and was correlated with G-CIMP-low status (p = 0.010). Aside from the three well-known pathways of pathogenesis in glioblastomas, chromatin modifying and mismatch repair pathways were common aberrations (88.7% and 20.8%, respectively), the former due to high frequency of ATRX involvement. We conclude that IDH-mutant primary glioblastomas have better prognosis than secondary glioblastomas and have major molecular differences from other commoner glioblastomas. G-CIMP subgroups, MGMT promoter methylation, and TP53 mutation are useful prognostic adjuncts.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33692446
"""Increased effect of two-fraction radiotherapy in conjunction with IDO1 inhibition in experimental glioblastoma.""","""Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate therapeutic efficacy of single- or two-fraction radiotherapy in conjunction with IDO1-inhibition in a syngeneic rat glioblastoma model. IDO is known to cause immunosuppression through breakdown of tryptophan in the tumor microenvironment. Methods: Gene expression analyses of IDO in glioblastoma were performed with data from publicly available datasets. Fractionation studies were done on animals to evaluate tumor size, immune cell infiltration of tumors and serum profile on day 18 after tumor inoculation. Survival analyses were done with animals carrying intracranial glioblastomas comparing two-fraction radiotherapy+IDO1-inhibition to controls. IDO inhibition was achieved by administration of 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT), and radiotherapy (RT) was delivered in doses of 8Gy. Results: The expression of IDO1 was increased on gene level in glioblastoma stem cells. Tumor size was significantly reduced in animals treated with 1-MT+RTx 2 (both long and short intervals, i.e. 7 and 4 days between the treatments) as compared to control animals, animals treated with only 1-MT or animals treated with 1-MT+RTx1. Serum levels of IL-1A were significantly altered in all treated animals as compared to control animals. Survival was significantly increased in the animals treated with 1-MT+RTx2 (7-day interval) compared to control animals. Conclusions: Addition of two-fraction RT to IDO1 inhibition with 1-MT significantly reduced tumor size in animals with glioblastoma. Survival was significantly increased in animals treated with two-fractioned RT+1-MT as compared to untreated controls increased significantly. Advances in knowledge: The currently used combination of only two fractions of radiotherapy and immune therapy is a promising area of research, increasing efficacy compared to single fraction irradiation, while potentially lowering radiation side effects compared to radiation in current clinical practice.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469935
"""Characterisation of the tumour microenvironment in primary and recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Aims: Glioblastoma patients have a dismal prognosis, due to inevitable tumour recurrence and respond poorly to immunotherapy. Tumour-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) dominate the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment and have been implicated in tumour progression and immune evasion. Early recurrent glioblastomas contain focal reactive regions with occasional fibrosis, chronic inflammation, TAMs and tumour cells. Surgical specimens from these tumours are rare and provide crucial insights into glioblastoma recurrence biology. This study aimed to characterise TAM- and lymphocyte phenotypes in primary vs early- and late-recurrent glioblastomas. Methods: Patient-matched primary and recurrent glioblastomas were compared between patients with early recurrences (n = 11, recurrence ≤6 months) and late recurrences (n = 12, recurrence after 12-19 months). Double-immunofluorescence stains combining Iba1 with HLA-DR, CD14, CD68, CD74, CD86, CD163, CD204 and CD206 along with stains for CD20, CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 were quantified with software-based classifiers. Results: Reactive regions in early recurrent tumours contained more TAMs (31.4% vs 21.7%, P = 0.01), which showed increased expression of CD86 (59.4% vs 38.4%, P = 0.04), CD204 (48.5% vs 28.4%, P = 0.03), CD206 (25.5% vs 14.4%, P = 0.04) and increased staining intensity for CD163 (86.4 vs 57.7 arbitrary units, P = 0.02), compared to late recurring tumours. Reactive regions contained more B-lymphocytes compared to patient-matched primary tumours (0.71% vs 0.40%, P = 0.04). Fractions of total, cytotoxic and regulatory T-lymphocytes did not differ. Conclusions: Early recurrent glioblastomas showed enrichment for TAMs, expressing both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers and B-lymphocytes.

"""Bioengineered Bacteriophage-Like Nanoparticles as RNAi Therapeutics to Enhance Radiotherapy against Glioblastomas.""","""Since glioblastomas (GBMs) are radioresistant malignancies and most GBM recurrences occur in radiotherapy, increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy by gene-silencing has recently attracted attention. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and RNA loading in nanoparticles leads to batch-to-batch variations of the RNA therapeutics, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Here, we bioengineer bacteriophage Qβ particles with a designed broccoli light-up three-way junction (b-3WJ) RNA scaffold (contains two siRNA/miRNA sequences and one light-up aptamer) packaging for the silencing of genes in radioresistant GBM cells. The in vitro results demonstrate that the cleavage of de novo designed b-3WJ RNA by Dicer enzyme can be easily monitored in real-time using fluorescence microscopy, and the TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR successfully knocks down EGFR and IKKα simultaneously and thereby inactivates NF-κB signaling to inhibit DNA repair. Delivery of TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR through convection-enhanced delivery (CED) infusion followed by 2Gy X-ray irradiation demonstrated that the median survival was prolonged to over 60 days compared with the 2Gy X-ray irradiated group (median survival: 31 days). Altogether, the results of this study could be critical for the design of RNAi-based genetic therapeutics, and CED infusion serves as a powerful delivery system for promoting radiotherapy against GBMs without evidence of systemic toxicity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120837
"""Physiological Imaging Methods for Evaluating Response to Immunotherapies in Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, with a dismal prognosis despite aggressive multi-modal therapy.

Standard MR imaging is not adequate for response assessment to immunotherapy in GBM patients even after using refined response assessment criteria secondary to amplified immune response. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective and alternative neuroimaging techniques for accurate response assessment. To this end, some groups have reported the potential of diffusion and perfusion MR imaging and amino acid-based positron emission tomography techniques in evaluating treatment response to different immunotherapeutic regimens in GBMs. The main goal of these techniques is to provide definitive metrics of treatment response at earlier time points for making informed decisions on future therapeutic interventions.

"""Borax regulates iron chaperone- and autophagy-mediated ferroptosis pathway in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is classified as a stage-IV glioma. Unfortunately, there are currently no curative treatments for GBM. Poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is a cytosolic iron chaperone with diverse functions. PCBP1 is also known to regulate autophagy, but the role of PCBP1 in ferroptosis, iron-dependent cell death pathway, remains unrevealed in GBM cells. Here, we investigated the effects of borax, a boron compound, on the ferroptosis signaling pathway mediated by PCBP1 and autophagy. The study analyzed cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle on U87-MG and HMC3 cells to investigate the effects of borax. After determining the cytotoxic concentrations of borax, morphological analyzes and measurement of PCBP1, Beclin1, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) levels were performed. Finally, expression levels of PCBP1, Beclin1, GPx4 and ACSL4, and caspase-3/7 activity were determined. We found that borax reduced U87-MG cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, borax altered cell proliferation and remarkably reduced S phase in the U87-MG cells and exhibited selectivity by having an opposite effect on normal cells (HMC3). According to DAPI staining, borax caused nuclear deficits in U87-MG cells. The result showed that borax in U87-MG cells induced reduction of the PCBP1, GSH, and GPx4 and enhancement of Beclin1, MDA, and ACSL4. Furthermore, borax triggered apoptosis by activating caspase 3/7 in U87-MG cells.

Several studies have reported a link between the distribution of ABO blood group antigens and a risk of developing specific types of cancer, although no consensus has been reached. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the distribution of ABO blood group antigens and the incidence of glioblastoma. Materials and methods: The study cohort consisted of 115 glioblastoma patients who were diagnosed at King Abdullah University Hospital, Jordan, between 2004 and 2015. Three different patient populations made up three control groups and these were selected from among patients at the same institution between 2014 and 2015 as follows: 3,847 healthy blood donors, 654 accidental trauma patients admitted to the Departments of Neurosurgery and Orthopaedics, and 230 age- and sex-matched control subjects recruited blindly from the Departments of Paediatrics and Internal Medicine. Results: There was a significant association between the distribution of ABO blood group antigens and the incidence of glioblastoma. Post hoc residual analysis revealed that individuals with group A had a higher than expected chance of developing glioblastoma, while individuals with group O had a lower than expected chance. Furthermore, individuals with group A were found to be at a 1.62- to 2.28-fold increased risk of developing glioblastoma compared to individuals with group O. Discussion: In the present study, we demonstrate that, in Jordan, individuals with group A have an increased risk of developing glioblastoma, while individuals with group O have a reduced risk. These findings suggest that the distribution of ABO blood group antigens is associated with a risk of brain tumours and may play an important role in their development.

The NGS assays used as well as the criteria for the application of NGS in newly diagnosed glioblastoma were investigated. Decision trees were analysed for consensus and discrepancies using the objective consensus methodology. Results: Seven out of eight centres perform NGS in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma using custom made or commercially available assays. The criteria most relevant to decision making were age, suitability of standard treatment and fitness. NGS is most often used in fitter patients under the age of 60 years who are not suitable for standard therapy, while it is rarely performed in patients in poor general health.

"""Gyriform infiltration as imaging biomarker for molecular glioblastomas.""","""Background: Molecular glioblastomas (i.e. without the histological but with the molecular characteristics of IDH-wild-type glioblastoma) frequently lack contrast enhancement, which can wrongly lead to suspect a lower-grade glioma. Herein, we aimed to assess the diagnostic value of gyriform infiltration as an imaging marker for molecular glioblastomas. Methods: Two independent investigators reviewed the MRI scans from patients with newly diagnosed gliomas for the presence of a gyriform infiltration defined as an elective cortical hypersignal on MRI FLAIR sequence. Diagnostic test performance of this sign for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma were calculated. Results: A total of 426 patients were included, corresponding to 31 molecular glioblastoma, 294 IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, 50 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and 51 IDH-mutant 1p19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma.

All the 56 gyriform-infiltration-positive tumors were IDH-wild-type and all but two had a TERT promoter mutation. The inter-rater agreement was good (κ = 0.69, p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the presence of a gyriform infiltration for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma were 52%, 90%, 29%, 96%, respectively. The median overall survival was better for gyriform-infiltration-negative patients compared to gyriform-infiltration-positive patients in the whole series and in patients with non-enhancing lesions (n = 95) (25.6 vs 16.9 months, p = 0.005 and 20.2 months vs not reached, p < 0.001).

"""Glioblastoma inhibition by cell surface immunoglobulin protein EWI-2, in vitro and in vivo.""","""EWI-2, a cell surface IgSF protein, is highly expressed in normal human brain but is considerably diminished in glioblastoma tumors and cell lines. Moreover, loss of EWI-2 expression correlated with a shorter survival time in human glioma patients, suggesting that EWI-2 might be a natural inhibitor of glioblastoma. In support of this idea, EWI-2 expression significantly impaired both ectopic and orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice in vivo. In vitro assays provided clues regarding EWI-2 functions. Expression of EWI-2 in T98G and/or U87-MG malignant glioblastoma cell lines failed to alter two-dimensional cell proliferation but inhibited glioblastoma colony formation in soft agar and caused diminished cell motility and invasion. At the biochemical level, EWI-2 markedly affects the organization of four molecules (tetraspanin proteins CD9 and CD81 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MT1-MMP), which play key roles in the biology of astrocytes and gliomas. EWI-2 causes CD9 and CD81 to become more associated with each other, whereas CD81 and other tetraspanins become less associated with MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. We propose that EWI-2 inhibition of glioblastoma growth in vivo is at least partly explained by the capability of EWI-2 to inhibit growth and/or invasion in vitro. Underlying these functional effects, EWI-2 causes a substantial molecular reorganization of multiple molecules (CD81, CD9, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP) known to affect proliferation and/or invasion of astrocytes and/or glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19107234
"""Glioblastomas at the white matter of temporo-parietal junction cause a poor postoperative independence level.""","""Introduction: Right cerebral hemispheric glioblastomas (GBMs) often decrease the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score postoperatively, despite the patient having sufficient patient function while performing daily living. This study aimed to evaluate the factors that could cause poor KPS scores during the postoperative chronic phase in patients with right cerebral hemispheric GBMs. Methods: Data of 47 patients with newly diagnosed right cerebral hemispheric GBMs were analyzed. All patients were assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively to determine KPS and brain function. To determine tumor location related to the postoperative KPS scores, we used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). The patients were divided into two groups (involvement and non-involvement groups) based on whether their lesion involved a significant region identified by VLSM. We then compared functional factors and prognosis between the groups using the chi-squared and log-rank tests, respectively. Results: The KPS score significantly decreased after surgery compared to that preoperatively measured (p = 0.023). VLSM revealed that tumors in the white matter of temporo-parietal junction (WM-TPJ) caused a significant decline in the KPS score at three months postoperatively. The patients in the involvement group had a higher probability of impaired attention, visuospatial cognition, emotion recognition, and visual field than did those in the non-involvement group. In addition, tumor in the WM-TPJ were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival (p = 0.039 and 0.023, respectively). Conclusions: GBMs involving the right WM-TPJ are more likely to result in poor postoperative KPS scores and prognoses. Impairments of several kinds of brain functions caused by tumor invasion to the WM-TPJ may be associated with lower KPS scores.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37847481

Currently, numerous studies are attempting to decipher their genetic and epigenetic modifications, to identify the cells at the origin of gliomagenesis, and to better understand the molecular bases responsible for invasion and angiogenesis processes. Methods: This article reviews recent data on the cellular and molecular biology of gliomas delineated by several teams including ours. We and others have underlined the role played by cancer stem cells in gliomagenesis; the Cancer Genome Atlas Network has described most glioblastoma genetic alterations. Results: According to many studies, glioblastomas derive from malignant transformation of stem cells and/or glial precursor cells. Moreover, the topographic microenvironment is important regarding invasion and angiogenesis processes. Finally, it is now well established, thanks to IDH1 mutation identification, that primary and secondary glioblastomas are two different clinical and genetic entities. Interestingly, IDH1 mutation seems to be a very early genomic modification in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and secondary glioblastoma tumorigenic processes. Conclusions: Regarding all these data, we suggest a hypothetical model of glioma initiation, growth, and progression.

This study investigated whether CD47 promotes human glioblastoma invasion and, if so, the underlying mechanisms involved. CD47 expression was found to be stronger in tissues of patients with glioblastoma and in various cancer cell lines than in normal controls. CD47 downregulation via siRNA suppressed invasion in vitro, whereas CD47 overexpression through plasmid transfection exerted the opposite effect. However, overexpression or knocking down of CD47 had no effect on cell proliferation. Moreover, CD47 expression was related to Akt phosphorylation at the cellular molecular level. Suppression of Akt with a specific inhibitor impaired the invasion ability of CD47-overexpressing cells, indicating that stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway served as the downstream regulator of CD47-triggered invasion. These results suggest that CD47 might be a useful predictor of poor prognosis and metastasis and a potential target for treating glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29321087
"""Unplanned intensive care unit readmission after surgical treatment in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma - forfeiture of surgically achieved advantages?""","""Postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring is an established option to ensure patient safety after resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In contrast, secondary unplanned ICU readmission following complicating events during the initial postoperative course might be associated with severe morbidity and impair initially intended surgical benefit. In the present study, we assessed the prognostic impact of secondary ICU readmission and aimed to identify preoperatively ascertainable risk factors for the development of such adverse events in patients treated surgically for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Between 2013 and 2018, 240 patients were surgically treated for newly diagnosed glioblastoma at the authors' neuro-oncological center. Secondary ICU readmission was defined as any unplanned admission to the ICU during initial hospital stay. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify preoperatively measurable risk factors for unplanned ICU readmission. Nineteen of 240 glioblastoma patients (8%) were readmitted to the ICU. Median overall survival of patients with unplanned ICU readmission was 9 months compared to 17 months for patients without secondary ICU readmission (p=0.008). Multivariable analysis identified 'preoperative administration of dexamethasone > 7 days' (p=0.002) as a significant and independent predictor of secondary unplanned ICU admission. Secondary ICU readmission following surgery for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is significantly associated with poor survival and thus may negate surgically achieved prerequisites for further treatment.

Despite the inability of histologic and molecular genetic studies to identify distinguishing features between RIGs and pediatric GBMs, gene microarrays suggested significant differences between these 2 tumor types, at least those occurring in pediatric patients. Pediatric RIGs show greater homogeneity of gene expression than do de novo pediatric GBMs. Greater overlap was detected in gene expression patterns between RIGs and pilocytic astrocytomas than between RIGs and GBMs, medulloblastomas, ependymomas, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, or rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting a common precursor cell for RIG and pilocytic astrocytoma.

The treatment strategies for this disease have not changed appreciably for many years and most are based on a limited understanding of the biology of the disease. Growth factors are potential targets for therapeutic strategies because they are essential for tumor growth and progression. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional regulatory peptide with mitogenic and angiogenic capabilities among others. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that AM mRNA was correlated to the tumor type and grade, with high expression in all glioblastomas analysed, whereas a low expression was found in anaplastic astrocytomas and barely detectable levels in low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendriogliomas. The correlation of AM expression to the grade of glioma support the hypothesis that AM may participate in the progression of gliomas. We demonstrate that AM may function as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for glioblastoma cells. The data demonstrated that the anti-AM antibody significantly suppress the growth of established glioblastoma xenografts. The action of AM is specific and is mediated by the calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity-modifying protein-2 and -3 (CRLR/RAMP2, CRLR/RAMP3). Furthermore, the proangiogenic action of AM on cultured endothelial cells via CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 receptors may translate in vivo into enhanced neovascularization and therefore identify AM and its receptors acting as potential new targets for antiangiogenic therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15888388

In the era of the WHO 2021 Classification of CNS Tumors, the prognostic impact of a contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement is not clearly elucidated. Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective, single-centre cohort study at a tertiary neurosurgical oncology centre (January 2006 - December 2022). We screened adult patients with a newly-diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype in order to assess the prognosis role of the contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement. Results: We included 1149 glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype: 26 (2.3%) had a no contrast enhancement, 45 (4.0%) had a faint and patchy contrast enhancement, 118 (10.5%) had a nodular contrast enhancement, and 960 (85.5%) had a ring-like contrast enhancement. Overall survival was longer in non-contrast enhanced glioblastomas (26.7 months) than in contrast enhanced glioblastomas (10.9 months) (p < 0.001). In contrast enhanced glioblastomas, a ring-like pattern was associated with shorter overall survival than in faint and patchy and nodular patterns (10.0 months versus 13.0 months, respectively) (p = 0.033). Whatever the presence of a contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement, surgical resection was an independent predictor of longer overall survival, while age ≥ 70 years, preoperative KPS score < 70, tumour volume ≥ 30cm3, and postoperative residual contrast enhancement were independent predictors of shorter overall survival. Conclusion: A contrast enhancement is present in the majority (97.7%) of glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype and, regardless of the pattern, is associated with a shorter overall survival. The ring-like pattern of contrast enhancement is typical in glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype (85.5%) and remains an independent predictor of shorter overall survival compared to other patterns (faint and patchy and nodular).""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38913230

Diagnosis is challenging, as the sensitivity of classic diagnostic investigations remains low for detecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor spread and exclusion of infectious causes is mandatory, especially if unusual clinical findings are present. Case presentation: A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for recurrent episodes of high fever and xanthochromic meningitis, with subacute onset. Her past medical history was significant for a left temporal glioblastoma, treated with surgical resection and adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy, with associated systemic immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy.

Methods: In this study, we investigated, in a retrospective local discovery cohort and a validation TCGA dataset, expression of CD80 and CD86 at mRNA level and their prognostic significance in response to standard of care. Furthermore, CD80 and CD86 at the protein level were investigated in the discovery cohort. Results: Both CD80 and CD86 are expressed heterogeneously in the TME at mRNA and protein levels. In a univariate analysis, the mRNA expression of CD80 and CD86 was not significantly correlated with OS in both local OncoNeuroTek dataset and TCGA datasets. CD80 and CD86 mRNA high expression was significantly associated with shorter progression free survival (PFS) (p < 0.05).

Data was collected for multiple variables including age, gender, race, length of hospital stay after brain biopsy, total number of hospital admissions unrelated to VTE, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), use of Bevacizumab and any bleeding episodes. Patients with GBM who had VTE had poorer KPS scores, with the majority (57%) being in between 40 and 70, as compared to the controls where majority (82%) had better performance (KPS 80-100). For every one year increase in age, the odds of developing VTE increased by 3% (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.02-1.04, p < 0.001) with the mean age being 61.8 ± 11.4 years. GBM patients who developed a VTE were found to have greater number of hospital admissions (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.33-1.53, p < 0.001) and longer stays in hospital after GBM biopsy (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.09-1.18, p < 0.001).

"""A molecular genetic model of astrocytoma histopathology.""","""As the molecular events responsible for astrocytoma formation and progression are being clarified, it is becoming possible to correlate these alterations with the specific histopathological and biological features of astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In WHO grade II astrocytomas, autocrine stimulation by the plateletderived growth factor system coupled with inactivation of the p53 gene may lead to a growth stimulus in the face of decreased cell death with slow net growth ensuing. Such cells would also have defective responses to DNA damage and impaired DNA repair, setting the stage for future malignant change. Such biological scenarios recapitulate many of the clinicopathological features of WHO grade II astrocytomas. Anaplastic astrocytomas further display release of a critical cell cycle brake that involves the CDKN2/p16, RB and CDK4 genes. This results in mitoses seen histologically; clinically, there is more conspicuous, rapid growth. Finally, glioblastomas may emerge from the microenvironmental outgrowth of more malignant clones in a complex vicious cycle that involves necrosis, hypoxia, growth factor release, angiogenesis and clonal selection; growth signals mediated by activation of epidermal growth factor receptors may precipitate glioblastomas. It is clear as well that glioblastoma multiforme can arise via a number of independent genetic pathways, although the clinical significance of these distinctions remains unclear.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9161727
"""Chromatin accessibility analysis identifies GSTM1 as a prognostic marker in human glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant human brain tumor that has an extremely poor prognosis. Classic mutations such as IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) alternations, and MGMT (O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase) promoter hypermethylation have been used to stratify patients and provide prognostic significance. Epigenetic perturbations have been demonstrated in glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Despite the genetic markers used in the management of glioblastoma patients, new biomarkers that could predict patient survival independent of known biomarkers remain to be identified. Methods: ATAC-seq (assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing) and RNA-seq have been used to profile chromatin accessible regions using glioblastoma patient samples with short-survival versus long-survival. Cell viability, cell cycle, and Western blot analysis were used to characterize the cellular phenotypes and identify signaling pathways. Results: Analysis of chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq coupled with RNA-seq methods identified the GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase mu-1) gene, which featured higher chromatin accessibility in GBM tumors with short survival. GSTM1 was confirmed to be a significant prognostic marker to predict survival using a different GBM patient cohort. Knockdown of GSTM1 decreased cell viability, caused cell cycle arrest, and decreased the phosphorylation levels of the NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) p65 subunit and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (pSer727). Conclusions: This report demonstrates the use of ATAC-seq coupled with RNA-seq to identify GSTM1 as a prognostic marker of GBM patient survival. Activation of phosphorylation levels of NF-kB p65 and STAT3 (pSer727) by GSTM1 is shown. Analysis of chromatin accessibility in patient samples could generate an independent biomarker that can be used to predict patient survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34732244
"""Prognostic implications of epilepsy in glioblastomas.""","""Objectives: The role of seizures and antiepileptic treatments associated with glioblastoma is a current topic of discussion. The objective of this study is to characterize and establish implications of epilepsy associated with glioblastoma. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical history, focused on epileptic features of 134 histologically diagnosed glioblastoma over a period of 4 years. Results: The sample group had an average age of 56 years and 66% were male. Complete tumor resection was performed in 66% and 64.2% received further radio-oncologic treatment. The average survival rate was 12.4 months and 11.5% survived to 5 years. Epileptic seizures were the presentation symptom in 27% of cases and 51% suffered seizures during the disease, 26% become drug-resistant. Focal evolving to a bilateral convulsive seizures were the most frequent type. Epileptic seizures at presentation independently predicted longer survival (p<0.001). Furthermore, a history of epilepsy or seizures during disease improved survival. Late onset seizures, recurrences or status epilepticus during the course of the disease indicated tumor progression or the final stages of life. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs did not prevent seizures. Similarly, there was no difference in survival between patients who did not use antiepileptic drugs and those using valproate or levetiracetam. Patients under 60 years, full oncologic treatment and secondary glioblastomas were factors that improved survival (p<0.001). Conclusion: Previous history of epilepsy or the onset of seizures as a presentation symptom in glioblastomas predict longer survival. Half of patients have seizures during the course of the disease. Antiepileptic drugs alone do not increase survival in glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489387

Our goal is to identify CDKN2A specific qualitative imaging biomarkers in glioblastomas using a new informatics workflow that enables rapid analysis of qualitative imaging features with Visually AcceSAble Rembrandtr Images (VASARI) for large datasets in PACS. Sixty nine patients undergoing GBM resection with CDKN2A status determined by whole-exome sequencing were included. GBMs on magnetic resonance images were automatically 3D segmented using deep learning algorithms incorporated within PACS. VASARI features were assessed using FHIR forms integrated within PACS. GBMs without CDKN2A alterations were significantly larger (64 vs. 30%, p = 0.007) compared to tumors with homozygous deletion (HOMDEL) and heterozygous loss (HETLOSS). Lesions larger than 8 cm were four times more likely to have no CDKN2A alteration (OR: 4.3; 95% CI 1.5-12.1; p < 0.001). We developed a novel integrated PACS informatics platform for the assessment of GBM molecular subtypes and show that tumors with HOMDEL are more likely to have radiographic evidence of pial invasion and less likely to have deep white matter invasion or subependymal invasion.

"""Sulindac induces differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells making them more sensitive to oxidative stress.""","""Glioblastoma tumors (GBM) are very heterogeneous, being comprised of several cell subtypes, including glioblastoma stem cells (GSC). These tumors have a high rate of recurrence after initial treatment and one of the most prevalent theories to explain this is the cancer stem cell theory, which proposes that glioblastomas arise from mutations that transform normal neural stem cells (NSC) into GSC, which are highly resistant to oxidative stress and anti-cancer therapies. Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been shown to protect the normal cells against oxidative damage by initiating a preconditioning response, but selectively sensitizes several cancer cell lines to agents that affect mitochondrial respiration, resulting in enhanced killing of the cancer cells. These effects of sulindac are independent of its NSAID activity. There is little information on the effect of sulindac on normal and cancer stem cells. To study the effect of sulindac on both normal and cancer stem cells, we have isolated normal neural stem cells (NSC), from mice hippocampi and glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) from a glioma cell line, U87. As expected from previous studies sulindac can protect normal astrocytes against oxidative stress. Sulindac induces differentiation of both NSC and GSC cells and sulindac upregulates neurogenesis in NSC. The differentiated NSC are also protected from oxidative stress damage, whereas the differentiation of GSC by sulindac increases the sensitivity of these cells to agents that cause oxidative stress. The S epimer of sulindac is more effective than the R epimer in inducing neuronal differentiation in both NSC and GSC. These results indicate that the ability of sulindac to induce GSC differentiation may have therapeutic value in preventing tumour recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29788733

A lot of experimental models are used to evaluate various properties of glioblastoma. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane model is one of them. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate histology and survival of glioblastoma tumors taken immediately from operating theatre and transplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Glioblastoma samples obtained from 10 patients were transplanted onto 200 eggs. Overall, we used 15 tumors; only 5 of them were not glioblastomas as it was revealed later. RESULTS. The transplanted tumors survive up to 6 days. Transplants do not survive longer because during embryo's development the nourishing membrane dries. Transplanted glioblastomas exhibited the same features as original glioblastomas - necrosis, endothelium proliferation, cellular polymorphism - while transplanted glioblastomas also showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, Ki67, S100 protein, neurofilament immunoreactivity, and infiltration of macrophages (CD68) and T cells (CD3(+), CD8(+)). Transplanted glioblastomas did not show any immunoreactivity of p53. Invasion of vessels from the chicken into transplanted tumor is not observed. Chicken erythrocytes did not appear within the transplants, and tumor cells invade chicken tissue at the minimum. CONCLUSION. Our data show that transplanted pieces of glioblastoma survive with all cytological features. The presence of macrophages (marker CD68) and T cells (markers CD3(+) and CD8(+)) can be registered in the transplant. The data revealed that transplanted glioblastoma remains as insulated unit, which survives from nourishment of the chorioallantoic membrane apparently only by diffusion.

Since DXC presents favorable pharmacokinetics properties including the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that it could radiosensitize brain tumors as well. We have investigated the radiosensitizing capacity of DXC towards human glioma initiating cells (GIC)-driven orthotopic glioblastomas (GB) in NOD/SCID mice that faithfully mimic the growth properties of the clinical tumors of origin. DXC at 10 mg/Kg body weight was subcutaneously delivered daily, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. At the same time, radiotherapeutic fractions of 0.25 Gy to the head were delivered every 3-4 days (twice/week) for 15 weeks. No survival advantage was observed in DXC-treated mice as compared to vehicle-treated mice by this radiosensitizing protocol. On the contrary, skin damage with hair loss and deep ulcers were observed after 4 weeks in DXC-treated mice leading to discontinuation of drug treatment. These results do not support the use of DXC as a radiosensitizer for brain tumors and indicate skin damage as an important side effect of DXC.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30961616

Differential expression patterns of key genes (KGs) between GBM and control samples were verified by different independent databases. Gene regulatory network (GRN) detected some important transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators for KGs. The KGs-set enrichment analysis unveiled some crucial GBM-causing molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and pathways. The DNA methylation analysis detected some hypo-methylated CpG sites that might stimulate the GBM development. From the immune infiltration analysis, we found that almost all KGs are associated with different immune cell infiltration levels.

"""Induction of apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppression of ERK/NF-kappaB signalling participate in anti-glioblastoma of imipramine.""","""Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of brain tumour, with poor prognosis even after standard treatment such as surgical resection, temozolomide and radiation therapy. The overexpression of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in glioblastomas is recognized as an important treatment target. Thus, an urgent need regarding glioblastomas is the development of a new, suitable agent that may show potential for the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has anti-inflammatory actions against inflamed glial cells; additionally, imipramine can induce glioblastoma toxicity via the activation of autophagy. However, whether imipramine can suppress glioblastoma progression via the induction of apoptosis and blockage of ERK/NF-κB signalling remains unclear. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of imipramine on apoptotic signalling and ERK/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression by using cell proliferation (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT] assay), flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cell invasion/migration assay analysis in vitro. The ERK and NF-κB inhibitory capacity of imipramine is detected by NF-κB reporter gene assay and Western blotting. Additionally, a glioblastoma-bearing animal model was used to validate the therapeutic efficacy and general toxicity of imipramine. Our results demonstrated that imipramine successfully triggered apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppressed the invasion/migration ability of glioblastoma cells.

We hypothesized that deletion of NFKBIA (encoding nuclear factor of κ-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-α), an inhibitor of the EGFR-signaling pathway, promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastomas that do not have alterations of EGFR. Methods: We analyzed 790 human glioblastomas for deletions, mutations, or expression of NFKBIA and EGFR. We studied the tumor-suppressor activity of NFKBIA in tumor-cell culture. We compared the molecular results with the outcome of glioblastoma in 570 affected persons. Results: NFKBIA is often deleted but not mutated in glioblastomas; most deletions occur in nonclassical subtypes of the disease. Deletion of NFKBIA and amplification of EGFR show a pattern of mutual exclusivity. Restoration of the expression of NFKBIA attenuated the malignant phenotype and increased the vulnerability to chemotherapy of cells cultured from tumors with NFKBIA deletion; it also reduced the viability of cells with EGFR amplification but not of cells with normal gene dosages of both NFKBIA and EGFR. Deletion and low expression of NFKBIA were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients who had tumors with NFKBIA deletion had outcomes that were similar to those in patients with tumors harboring EGFR amplification. These outcomes were poor as compared with the outcomes in patients with tumors that had normal gene dosages of NFKBIA and EGFR. A two-gene model that was based on expression of NFKBIA and O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase was strongly associated with the clinical course of the disease.

This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the thrombocyte to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as indicators of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in glioblastoma patients. Methods: A total of 90 patients treated for glioblastoma were retrospectively evaluated. Absolute counts were used to generate NLR and PLR. A SIR was considered to be present with an NLR ≥5 and/or PLR ≥150. Results: Median follow-up time was 11.3 months (range: 1-70 months). The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 55.2% and 19.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that there was no correlation between overall survival and gender (p=0.184), comorbid disease (p = 0.30), clinical presentation (p = 0.884), or tumour lateralization (p = 0.159). Multivariate analysis showed that overall survival was significantly correlated with SIR based on NLR (HR: 2.41), and ECOG performance status (HR: 1.53). The prognostic factors that affected survival, other than SIR, were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (p = 0.003), and tumour localization (p = 0.006). Conclusion: The present findings confirm that NLR based on peripheral blood counts prior to treatment can be used as a prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma.

There are reasons, however, to expect that the therapeutic response of AAs may differ from those of glioblastoma. Here, we examined the clinical benefit of gross total resection (GTR) in AA relative to glioblastoma patients. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, we identified 2755 patients with AA and patients with 21,962 glioblastoma between 1999 and 2010. Surgical resection was defined as GTR, subtotal resection (STR), biopsy only, or no resection. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression were used to assess the association between GTR and survival. Results: The hazard of dying from the AA was reduced in GTR patients by 40% relative to STR patients. This reduction is 59% greater than that observed in glioblastoma where GTR was associated only with a 24% reduction relative to STR (P < 0.0001). The median survival for patients with AA who underwent GTR and subtotal resection were 64 and 24 months, respectively. For glioblastoma patients, the corresponding numbers for median survival were 13 and 9 months, respectively. The survival benefit of GTR in patients with AA was particularly notable in patient age < 50, where the median survival was not reached during the study period. Conclusions: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data suggest that survival benefit associated with GTR was greater for patients with AA relative to glioblastoma patients, particularly for patients < age 50.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26924115

We compared HMGA2 expression between glioblastoma and normal brain tissue. In addition, we analyzed and compared HMGA2 expression in the border and center zones of tumors. Correlation tests between HMGA expression and clinical parameters such as MGMT-status and survival were performed. Methods: Samples from 23 patients with WHO grade 4 glioblastomas were analyzed for HMGA2 expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated with clinical parameters. The areas from the tumor center and border were analyzed separately. Two normal brain tissue specimens were used as the controls. Results: Our results confirm that HMGA2 is higher expressed in glioblastoma compared to healthy brain tissue (qPCR, P=0.013; IHC, P=0.04). Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher HMGA2 expression in the border zone of the tumor than in the tumor center zone (P=0.012). Survival analysis revealed a tendency for shorter survival when HMGA2 was highly expressed in the border zone.

Here, we investigated whether TGFbeta promotes FAP expression in transformed and stromal cells constituting the glioblastoma microenvironment. We found that both FAP and TGFbeta-1 are upregulated in glioblastomas and display a significant positive correlation. We detected TGFbeta-1 immunopositivity broadly in glioblastoma tissues, including tumor parenchyma regions in the immediate vicinity of FAP-immunopositive perivascular stromal cells. Wedemonstrate for the first time that TGFbeta-1 induces expression of FAP in non-stem glioma cells, pericytes, and glioblastoma-derived endothelial and FAP+ mesenchymal cells, but not in glioma stem-like cells. In glioma cells, this effect is mediated by the TGFbeta type I receptor and canonical Smad signaling and involves activation of FAP gene transcription. We further present evidence of FAP regulation by TGFbeta-1 secreted by glioma cells.

The diagnosis of lymph node metastases from glioblastoma was confirmed with an OncoScan assay and pathologic analysis. The brain and lymph node tumors had identical genotypes: C228T-mutated TERT promoter, wild-type IDH1, wild-type IDH2, wild-type TP53, EGFR amplification, and unmethylated MGMT promoter. Subsequently, multiple bone metastases were detected and treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery. Widespread extraneural metastases were detected 49 months after the initial diagnosis, and the patient underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin and semustine. There was no evidence of intracranial relapse until death, which occurred 5 months after chemotherapy. Conclusions: Similar to carcinomas, glioblastomas can spread via the lymphatic route. Extensive therapies for extraneural metastases from glioblastoma can alleviate discomfort and prolong survival, especially in patients without intracranial relapse.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26852708
"""LINGO1, C7orf31 and VEGFA are prognostic genes of primary glioblastoma: analysis of gene expression microarray.""","""Glioblastoma is the most prevalent malignant glioma in WHO grade IV and its median overall survival is 12-15 months. This study identifies the primary glioblastoma. prognostic genes. Gene expression data in primary glioblastomas with short-term (36 months, N=23) overall survival were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE53733). Limma determined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different groups (|log2 fold change| ≥0.5 and p-value DEG's degree, betweenness, sub-graph and closeness centralities. Long- term/short-term survival-related DEGs were defined as those with increased/decreased expression values and survival time. The following DEGs were identified; 161 between intermediate and short-term glioblastomas, 465 between long-term and short-term and 624 between long-term and intermediate tumors. The common FLRT1 and LINGO1 up-regulated DEGs and common down-regulated C7orf31 were identified in these three DEG sets. PPI networks were established, and VEGFA was the key DEG in each PPI network. The short-term survival-related DEGs were enriched in 3 cancer-related pathways. Moreover, FLRT1 and LINGO1 were long-term survival-related DEGs and C7orf31 and VEGFA were short-term survival DEGs. LINGO1, C7orf31, and VEGFA were confirmed using a further dataset, and we therefore conclude that LINGO1 might be a positive primary glioblastoma prognostic gene and C7orf31 and VEGFA might be negative prognosticators.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064229
"""Leptomeningeal metastases in isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype glioblastomas revisited: Comprehensive analysis of incidence, risk factors, and prognosis based on post-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.""","""Background: The incidence of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) has been reported diversely. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of LM in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma. Methods: A total of 828 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma were enrolled between 2005 and 2022. Baseline preoperative MRI including post-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was used for LM diagnosis. Qualitative and quantitative features, including distance between tumor and subventricular zone (SVZ) and tumor volume by automatic segmentation of the lateral ventricles and tumor, were assessed. Logistic analysis of LM development was performed using clinical, molecular, and imaging data. Survival analysis was performed. Results: The incidence of LM was 11.4%. MGMTp unmethylation (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92, P = .014), shorter distance between tumor and SVZ (OR = 0.94, P = .010), and larger contrast-enhancing tumor volume (OR = 1.02, P < .001) were significantly associated with LM. The overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with LM than in those without (log-rank test; P < .001), with median OS of 12.2 and 18.5 months, respectively. The presence of LM remained an independent prognostic factor for OS in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (hazard ratio = 1.42, P = .011), along with other clinical, molecular, imaging, and surgical prognostic factors. Conclusions: The incidence of LM is high in patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and aggressive molecular and imaging factors are correlated with LM development. The prognostic significance of LM based on post-contrast FLAIR imaging suggests the acknowledgment of post-contrast FLAIR as a reliable diagnostic tool for clinicians.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38822538
"""The transcription factor ATF5: role in neurodevelopment and neural tumors.""","""We review recent findings regarding the properties of ATF5 and the major roles that this transcription factor plays in development of the nervous system and in survival of neural tumors. ATF5 is a widely expressed basic leucine zipper protein that has been subject to limited characterization. It is highly expressed in zones of neuroprogenitor cell proliferation. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that it functions there to promote neuroprogenitor cell expansion and to suppress their differentiation into neurons or glia. ATF5 expression is down-regulated by trophic factors and this is required for their capacity to promote neuroprogenitor cell cycle exit and differentiation into either neurons, oligodendroglia or astrocytes. ATF5 is also highly expressed in a number of tumor types, including neural tumors such as neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas and glioblastomas. Examination of the role of ATF5 in glioblastoma cells indicates that interference with its expression or activity causes them to undergo apoptotic death. In contrast, normal astrocytes and neurons do not appear to require ATF5 for survival, indicating that it may be a selective target for treatment of glioblastomas and other neural neoplasias. Further studies are needed to identify the transcriptional targets of ATF5 and the mechanisms by which its expression is regulated in neuroprogenitors and tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19046351
"""Risks and Benefits of Glioblastoma Resection in Older Adults: A Retrospective Austrian Multicenter Study.""","""Objective: To assess the prognostic profile, clinical outcome, treatment-associated morbidity, and treatment burden of elderly patients with glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing microsurgical tumor resection as part of contemporary treatment algorithms. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients with GBM ≥65 years of age who were treated by resection at 2 neuro-oncology centers. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses; log-rank tests identified prognostic factors. Results: The study population included 160 patients (mean age, 73.1 ± 5.1 years), and the median contrast-enhancing tumor volume was 31.0 cm3. Biomarker analyses revealed O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase-promoter methylation in 62.7% and wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase in 97.5% of tumors. The median extent of resection (EOR) was 92.3%, surgical complications were noted in 10.0% of patients, and the median postoperative hospitalization period was 8 days. Most patients (60.0%) received adjuvant radio-/chemotherapy. The overall treatment-associated morbidity was 30.6%. The median progression-free and overall survival were 5.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-6.4 months) and 10.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-11.7 months). The strongest predictors for favorable outcome were patient age ≤73.0 years (P = 0.0083), preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score ≥80% (P = 0.0179), postoperative modified Rankin Scale score ≤1 (P < 0.0001), adjuvant treatment (P < 0.0001), and no treatment-associated morbidity (P = 0.0478). Increased EOR did not correlate with survival (P = 0.5046), but correlated significantly with treatment-associated morbidity (P = 0.0031). Conclusions: Clinical outcome for elderly patients with GBM remains limited. Nonetheless, the observed treatment-associated morbidity and treatment burden were moderate in the patients, and patient age and performance status remained the strongest predictors for survival.

"""Transfer of functional microRNAs between glioblastoma and microvascular endothelial cells through gap junctions.""","""Extensive invasion and angiogenesis are hallmark features of malignant glioblastomas. Here, we co-cultured U87 human glioblastoma cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) to demonstrate the exchange of microRNAs that initially involve the formation of gap junction communications between the two cell types. The functional inhibition of gap junctions by carbenoxolone blocks the transfer of the anti-tumor miR-145-5p from HMEC to U87, and the transfer of the pro-invasive miR-5096 from U87 to HMEC. These two microRNAs exert opposite effects on angiogenesis in vitro. MiR-5096 was observed to promote HMEC tubulogenesis, initially by increasing Cx43 expression and the formation of heterocellular gap junctions, and secondarily through a gap-junction independent pathway. Our results highlight the importance of microRNA exchanges between tumor and endothelial cells that in part involves the formation of functional gap junctions between the two cell types.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27661112
"""Zika virus and brain cancer: Can Zika be an effective treatment for brain cancer? A systematic review.""","""Introduction: Many studies have highlighted the use of oncolytic viruses as a new class of therapeutic agents for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, especially glioblastomas (GMB). Zika Virus (ZIKV) proteins targeted to specific stem cells have been studied in vitro and animal models with promising results. Materials and methods: A systematic review was evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ZIKV use for CNS tumors treatment. Data were extracted and the in vivo studies were evaluated using the Robins-I tool. We assessed bias in each study using criteria such as selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and others. According to Cochrane guidelines, bias was classified as high, low, or uncertain. High bias occurred when studies did not meet the criteria. Low bias was assigned when criteria were clearly met. Uncertain bias reflected insufficient information for a clear classification. Results: The 14 included studies shown that ZIKV reduced cell viability or inhibited the growth, proliferation of glioma stem cells (GSCs), and Bcl2 expression - which could potentially enhance the effect of chemotherapy/radiotherapy; caused cytopathic effects, induced tumor cell damage, manifested oncolytic properties, and even selectively safely killed GSCs; ultimately, it led to significant tumor remission and enhanced long-term survival through enhanced T-cell response. Conclusions: Although current evidence suggests ZIKV as a promising treatment for CNS tumors and may improve survival when combined with surgery and radiotherapy. Despite limited human evidence, it shows potential benefits. Further research is needed to confirm safety, efficacy, and optimize treatment in humans.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347716
"""Temozolomide induced liver injury.""","""A 62-year female received radiotherapy over six weeks with daily 75 mg/m2 Temozolomide (TMZ) for Glioblastoma (GB). At the last week of radiotherapy, her liver enzymes and serum bilirubin started deteriorating. TMZ was discontinued. The histopathology demonstrated the features of acute cholestasis and focal parenchymal inflammation. A range of investigations failed to show any other contributory cause of hepatitis. She required in-hospital care for a prolonged period for a grade three hepatic failure. The liver functions very slowly recovered over 40 weeks, but her general condition continues to deteriorate. TMZ may cause a mild temporary rise in the liver enzymes and has been reported to reactivate hepatitis B. In few other cases concomitant medications were the possible causes of hepatitis. However, searching the Medline and other bibliographic database, we have not come across any case of TMZ-induced liver injury (TMZ-DILI). Histopathology and pattern of liver enzyme elevation suggest that unlike Dacarbazine, which causes veno-occlusive type liver damage, TMZ in this patient caused mainly cholestasis type liver injury.

"""Prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma multiforme: focus on the pathologic variants.""","""The aim of this study was to offer predicting factors for survival in adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme. 153 consecutive patients with high-grade glioma (WHO grade IV) were studied in Imam Reza hospital, Kermanshah University of Medical Science, Kermanshah, Iran, between April 2003 and April 2017. All patients treated with surgical resection and standard postoperative radiotherapy (54 Gy). Using the patients' charts and electronic medical records system, the following data were obtained: gender, age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score on admission, primary vs. secondary type, extent of surgery, tumor location, tumor size, necrosis size, use of Temozolomide (TMZ), pathology subtype, and immunohistochemistry results. Patients were followed from the time of the surgery until the death occurred. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival time curves for various subgroups were compared by the log-rank test. The impact of the suggested prognostic factors on survival was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, gender, KPS, extent of surgery, tumor location, necrosis size, and reoperation in recurrence had not any statistically significant effect on survival. Univariate analysis revealed a significant impact on outcome for pathology subtype (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), tumor type (primary vs. secondary) (PFS: P = P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), tumor size (PFS: P = 0.044, OS: P = 0.04), TMZ therapy (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), P53 (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), and Ki67 (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, independent favorable prognostic factors for survival were pathology subtype (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), type (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: 0.012), TMZ (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), P53 (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001), and Ki67 (PFS: P < 0.001, OS: P < 0.001).

We examined 141 primary glioblastomas (pGBMs) and 25 secondary glioblastomas (sGBMs). NLRs, PLRs, and LMRs were calculated before surgery. IDH mutations were detected immunohistochemically after tumor resection, and patients' clinical outcomes were analyzed after classification into GBM, pGBM, and IDH-wild type glioblastoma (IDH-wt GBM) groups. To make comparisons, we set cutoffs for NLR, PLR and LMR of 4.0, 175.0, and 3.7, respectively.

"""Molecular genetic analysis of deep-seated glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma can be divided into genetic subsets. The most prominent criterion for dividing glioblastomas into subsets is the dichotomy between TP53 mutation and EGFR amplification, two genetic alterations that almost never coincide in the same tumor. Approximately one third of glioblastomas have TP53 mutations, one third have EGFR amplification, and one third have neither. When viewed in terms of tumor progression, secondary glioblastomas have a much higher incidence of TP53 mutations than do primary glioblastomas. When viewed in terms of the age of tumor onset, glioblastomas in young adults are likely to have TP53 mutations. However, no correlations have yet been found between the tumor locations and the genetic subsets. In this study, we evaluated the associations between the glioblastoma sites and the genetic subsets defined by the presence of the TP53 mutation or EGFR amplification in nine deep-seated glioblastomas of the thalamus and basal ganglia. All nine tumors were clinically defined as primary glioblastomas. Our investigation revealed that all tumors had TP53 mutations and none had EGFR amplifications. These findings suggest that glioblastomas deep-seated in the thalamus and basal ganglia can be grouped into a subset of glioblastomas with TP53 mutations, akin to the subsets of secondary and younger adult glioblastomas.

"""Targeting EGFR induced oxidative stress by PARP1 inhibition in glioblastoma therapy.""","""Despite the critical role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma pathogenesis, EGFR targeted therapies have achieved limited clinical efficacy. Here we propose an alternate therapeutic strategy based on the conceptual framework of non-oncogene addiction. A directed RNAi screen revealed that glioblastoma cells over-expressing EGFRvIII, an oncogenic variant of EGFR, become hyper-dependent on a variety of DNA repair genes. Among these, there was an enrichment of Base Excision Repair (BER) genes required for the repair of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced DNA damage, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Subsequent studies revealed that EGFRvIII over-expression in glioblastoma cells caused increased levels of ROS, DNA strand break accumulation, and genome instability. In a panel of primary glioblastoma lines, sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition correlated with the levels of EGFR activation and oxidative stress. Gene expression analysis indicated that reduced expression of BER genes in glioblastomas with high EGFR expression correlated with improved patient survival. These observations suggest that oxidative stress secondary to EGFR hyper-activation necessitates increased cellular reliance on PARP1 mediated BER, and offer critical insights into clinical trial design.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20532243
"""Management of patients with recurrent glioblastoma using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults.

In this retrospective study, we evaluated treatment outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) in the management of recurrent GBM and report our single-center experience. Methods: Twenty-eight patients receiving HFSRT for recurrent GBM between September 2008 and February 2014 were retrospectively assessed. Total radiotherapy dose was 25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days for all patients. High-precision, image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy was delivered with a linear accelerator using 6-MV photons using the frameless technique. Analyzed prognostic factors were age, gender, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor location, planning target volume (PTV) size, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time interval between completion of treatment with Stupp protocol at primary diagnosis and recurrence. Results: Median follow-up time was 42 months (range 2-68). Median time interval between primary chemoradiotherapy and HFSRT was 11.2 months (range 4-57.9). Median OS and PFS calculated from reirradiation was 10.3 months and 5.8 months, respectively. Longer interval between initial treatment and recurrence (p = 0.01), smaller PTV size (p = 0.001), KPS ≥70 (p = 0.005) and younger age (p = 0.004) were associated with longer OS on statistical analysis.

"""Improved Survival with Decreased Wait Time to Surgery in Glioblastoma Patients Presenting with Seizure.""","""Background: Preoperative seizure is reported to confer favorable prognosis in glioblastoma patients, but studies to date have not investigated how broadly applicable seizure is as a prognostic factor. Objective: To investigate if prompter surgical intervention affects the relationship between preoperative seizure and prognosis in glioblastoma patients, focusing on the development of tumor growth and/or additional preoperative symptoms after seizure. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 443 patients (mean age = 60.2; 60% male) undergoing first glioblastoma resection at our institution (2005-2011). Results: Preoperative seizure(s) occurred in 28% of patients (n = 124), of which 63 (51%) had only seizure at presentation. Patients experiencing seizure as their only preoperative symptom ('seizure-only'; n = 45) survived over twice as long as patients who presented with seizure and then later developed additional preoperative symptoms (n = 18; 'other symptoms postseizure'; 26.8 vs 10.2 months, P < .001) and patients without preoperative seizure ('no seizure'; 26.8 vs 13.1 months, P < .001). Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed preoperative seizures only (hazard ratio 0.54 [0.37-0.75]; P < .001) to be independently associated with increased survival. Longer wait time from presentation (ie, diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging) to surgery was a risk factor for developing additional symptoms. Eleven 'other symptoms postseizure' patients (69%) vs 6 of the 'seizure-only' patients (15%) had wait times >45 days (P < .001).

"""N-acetylcysteine decreases malignant characteristics of glioblastoma cells by inhibiting Notch2 signaling.""","""Background: Glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) is the most devastating primary intracranial malignancy lacking effective clinical treatments. Notch2 has been established to be a prognostic marker and probably involved in GBM malignant progression. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular glutathione (GSH), has been widely implicated in prevention and therapy of several cancers. However, the role of NAC in GBM remains unclear and the property of NAC independent of its antioxidation is largely unknown. Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of Notch family and other related factors were detected by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. In addition, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry-based DCFH-DA. Moreover, cell viability was assessed by CCK8 and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry-based PI staining. The level of apoptosis was checked by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/PI. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and transwell invasion assays. At last, U87 Xenograft model was established to confirm whether NAC could restrain the growth of tumor. Results: Our data showed that NAC could decrease the protein level of Notch2. Meanwhile, NAC had a decreasing effect on the mRNA and protein levels of its downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1. These effects caused by NAC were independent of cellular GSH and ROS levels. The mechanism of NAC-mediated Notch2 reduction was elucidated by promoting Notch2 degradation through Itch-dependent lysosome pathway. Furthermore, NAC could prevent proliferation, migration, and invasion and might induce apoptosis in GBM cells via targeting Notch2. Significantly, NAC could suppress the growth of tumor in vivo. Conclusions: NAC could facilitate Notch2 degradation through lysosomal pathway in an antioxidant-independent manner, thus attenuating Notch2 malignant signaling in GBM cells. The remarkable ability of NAC to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth may implicate a novel application of NAC on GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30606241
"""Role of YKL-40 in the angiogenesis, radioresistance, and progression of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is one of the most fatal cancers, characterized by a strong vascularized phenotype. YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, is overexpressed in patients with glioblastomas and has potential as a novel tumor biomarker. The molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in glioblastoma development, however, are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role YKL-40 plays in the regulation of VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and radioresistance. YKL-40 up-regulated VEGF expression in glioblastoma cell line U87, and both YKL-40 and VEGF synergistically promote endothelial cell angiogenesis. Interestingly, long term inhibition of VEGF up-regulated YKL-40. YKL-40 induced coordination of membrane receptor syndecan-1 and integrin αvβ5, and triggered a signaling cascade through FAK(397) to ERK-1 and ERK-2, leading to elevated VEGF and enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, γ-irradiation of U87 cells increased YKL-40 expression that protects cell death through AKT activation and also enhances endothelial cell angiogenesis. Blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of human glioblastomas revealed a correlation between YKL-40, VEGF, and patient survival. These findings have shed light on the mechanisms by which YKL-40 promotes tumor angiogenesis and malignancy, and thus provide a therapeutic target for tumor treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21385870
"""MicroRNA-125b-2 confers human glioblastoma stem cells resistance to temozolomide through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.""","""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. miR-125b, one of the neuronal miRNAs, was recently found to be necessary for stem cell fission and for making stem cells insensitive to chemotherapy signals. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastomas. However, resistance develops quickly and with a high frequency. Given the insensitivity of some glioblastomas to TMZ and the hypothesis that glioma stem cells cause resistance to drug therapy, exploring the functions and mechanisms of miR-125b action on TMZ-treated glioblastoma stem cells would be valuable. In this study, we found that miR-125b-2 is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme tissues and the corresponding stem cells (GBMSC); downregulation of miR-125b-2 expression in GBMSC could allow TMZ to induce GBMSC apoptosis. Additionally, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased after the TMZ+miR-125b-2 inhibitor treatment, while the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax was increased. Further research demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis in GBMSC is also associated with increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria, induction of Apaf-1, activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-125b-2 overexpression might confer glioblastoma stem cells resistance to TMZ.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879257
"""Detection of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutated Glioblastomas Through Anomaly Detection Analytics.""","""Background: The rarity of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase mutated (mIDH) glioblastomas relative to wild-type IDH glioblastomas, as well as their distinct tumor physiology, effectively render them 'outliers'. Specialized tools are needed to identify these outliers. Objective: To carefully craft and apply anomaly detection methods to identify mIDH glioblastoma based on radiomic features derived from magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: T1-post gadolinium images for 188 patients and 138 patients were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive's (TCIA) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma collection, and from the University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC), respectively. Anomaly detection methods were tested on glioblastoma image features for the precision of mIDH detection and compared to standard classification methods. Results: Using anomaly detection training methods, we were able to detect IDH mutations from features in noncontrast-enhancing regions in glioblastoma with an average precision of 75.0%, 69.9%, and 69.8% using three different models. Anomaly detection methods consistently outperformed traditional two-class classification methods from 2 unique learning models (67.9%, 67.6%). The disparity in performances could not be overcome through newer, popular models such as neural networks (67.4%). Conclusion: We employed an anomaly detection strategy in the detection of IDH mutation in glioblastoma using preoperative T1 postcontrast imaging. We show these methods outperform traditional two-class classification in the setting of dataset imbalances inherent to IDH mutation prevalence in glioblastoma. We validate our results using an external dataset and highlight new possible avenues for radiogenomic rare event prediction in glioblastoma and beyond.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33887763
"""Selective destruction of glioblastoma cells by interference with the activity or expression of ATF5.""","""Glioblastoma multifome is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor with no current curative therapy. We found expression of the bZip transcription factor ATF5 in all 29 human glioblastomas and eight human and rat glioma cell lines assessed. ATF5 is not detectably expressed by mature brain neurons and astrocytes, but is expressed by reactive astrocytes. Interference with ATF5 function or expression in all glioma cell lines tested causes marked apoptotic cell death. In contrast, such manipulations do not affect survival of ATF5-expressing cultured astrocytes or of several other cell types that express this protein. In a proof-of-principle experiment, retroviral delivery of a function-blocking mutant form of ATF5 into a rat glioma model evokes death of the infected tumor cells, but not of infected brain cells outside the tumors. The widespread expression of ATF5 in glioblastomas and the selective effect of interference with ATF5 function/expression on their survival suggest that ATF5 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in such tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16170340
"""Overexpression of LncRNA PSMG3-AS1 Distinguishes Glioblastomas from Sarcoidosis.""","""In clinical practices, glioblastomas (GBM) in some cases can be misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis. This study aimed to develop a biomarker to distinguish GBM from sarcoidosis. In this study, we found that PSMG3-AS1 was upregulated in plasma of GBM patients in comparison with that in sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that upregulation of PSMG3-AS1 effectively separated GBM patients from sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. In GBM cells, overexpression of PSMG3-AS1 led to downregulated miR-34a and increased methylation of miR-34a gene. In addition, overexpression of PSMG3-AS1 reduced the inhibitory effects of miR-34a on GBM cell proliferation. In conclusion, overexpression of PSMG3-AS1 distinguishes GBM patients from patients with sarcoidosis, and PSMG3-AS1 may promote GBM cell proliferation by downregulating miR-34a through methylation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32529538
"""Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) is regulated by miR-125b and mediates VEGF-induced angiogenesis in glioblastoma.""","""In patients with glioblastomas, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Glioblastomas are notorious for their capacity to induce neovascularization, driving continued tumor growth. Here we report that miR-125b is down-regulated in glioblastoma-associated endothelial cells, resulting in increased expression of its target, myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), a transcription factor that regulates VEGF. The down-regulation of miR-125b was also observed on exposure of endothelial cells to glioblastoma-conditioned medium or VEGF, resulting in increased MAZ expression. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of MAZ accumulation by miR-125b, or by MAZ-specific shRNAs, attenuated primary human brain endothelial cell migration and tubule formation in vitro, phenomena considered to mimick angiogenic processes in vitro. Moreover, MAZ expression was elevated in brain blood vessels of glioblastoma patients. Altogether these results demonstrate a functional feed-forward loop in glioblastoma-related angiogenesis, in which VEGF inhibits the expression of miR-125b, resulting in increased expression of MAZ, which in its turn causes transcriptional activation of VEGF. This loop is functionally impeded by the VEGF receptor inhibitor vandetanib, and our results may contribute to the further development of inhibitors of tumor-angiogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22415301
"""Alcohol consumption and risk of glioblastoma; evidence from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study.""","""Despite the brain being highly susceptible to the action of alcohol and, therefore, potentially susceptible to its carcinogenic effects, it is not clear whether alcohol consumption is associated with risk of glioblastoma. We analyzed data from 39,766 participants of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study recruited in 1990-1994 and followed to the end of 2008 for an average of 15 years. Incidence of glioblastoma of the brain was ascertained via linkage to the Victorian and other State cancer registries in Australia. During a structured face-to-face interview at baseline we elicited each participant's history of alcoholic beverage consumption during the current decade at baseline. We used Cox regression models with age as the time metric, adjusted for country of birth, sex, total energy intake, educational attainment and coffee consumption to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 67 glioblastomas was diagnosed in the cohort during follow-up. The HRs associated with each additional 10 grams per day of alcohol intake was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.29; p for linear trend = 0.007). Compared to lifetime abstainer, the HR for glioblastoma associated with alcohol consumption were 1.07 (0.55 to 2.10) for 1 to 19 g/day, 1.79 (0.81 to 3.95) for 20 to 39 g/day, 3.07 (1.26 to 7.47) for 40 to 59 g/day and 2.54 (0.92 to 7.00) for 60 or more g/day.

"""Glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are differentially associated with the dichotomous regulation of glioblastoma cell migration versus proliferation.""","""Background: The dichotomy between glioblastoma cell migration and proliferation is regulated by various parameters including oxygen tension. In glioblastoma stem-like cells, hypoxia induces downregulation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes and a flux shift towards glycolysis. We investigated whether the 2 parallel glucose metabolic pathways are intrinsically linked with cell function and whether these pathways are mechanistically involved in regulating functional programs. Methods: Enzyme expression, migration, and proliferation under hypoxia were studied in multiple cell types. Rapidly and slowly dividing or migrating glioblastoma cells were separated, and enzyme profiles were compared. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and Aldolase C (ALDOC), the most strongly inversely regulated PPP and glycolysis enzymes, were knocked down by short hairpin RNA. Results: Hypoxia caused downregulation of PPP enzymes and upregulation of glycolysis enzymes in a broad spectrum of cancer and nonneoplastic cells and consistently stimulated migration while reducing proliferation. PPP enzyme expression was increased in rapidly dividing glioblastoma cells, whereas glycolysis enzymes were decreased. Conversely, glycolysis enzymes were elevated in migrating cells, whereas PPP enzymes were diminished. Knockdown of G6PD reduced glioblastoma cell proliferation, whereas ALDOC knockdown decreased migration. Enzyme inhibitors had similar effects. G6PD knockdown in a highly proliferative but noninvasive glioblastoma cell line resulted in prolonged survival of mice with intracerebral xenografts, whereas ALDOC knockdown shortened survival. In a highly invasive glioblastoma xenograft model, tumor burden was unchanged by either knockdown. Conclusions: Cell function and metabolic state are coupled independently of hypoxia, and glucose metabolic pathways are causatively involved in regulating 'go or grow' cellular programs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26917237
"""Why is there a lack of consensus on molecular subgroups of glioblastoma? Understanding the nature of biological and statistical variability in glioblastoma expression data.""","""Introduction: Gene expression patterns characterizing clinically-relevant molecular subgroups of glioblastoma are difficult to reproduce. We suspect a combination of biological and analytic factors confounds interpretation of glioblastoma expression data. We seek to clarify the nature and relative contributions of these factors, to focus additional investigations, and to improve the accuracy and consistency of translational glioblastoma analyses. Methods: We analyzed gene expression and clinical data for 340 glioblastomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed a logic model to analyze potential sources of biological, technical, and analytic variability and used standard linear classifiers and linear dimensional reduction algorithms to investigate the nature and relative contributions of each factor. Results: Commonly-described sources of classification error, including individual sample characteristics, batch effects, and analytic and technical noise make measurable but proportionally minor contributions to inconsistent molecular classification. Our analysis suggests that three, previously underappreciated factors may account for a larger fraction of classification errors: inherent non-linear/non-orthogonal relationships among the genes used in conjunction with classification algorithms that assume linearity; skewed data distributions assumed to be Gaussian; and biologic variability (noise) among tumors, of which we propose three types. Conclusions: Our analysis of the TCGA data demonstrates a contributory role for technical factors in molecular classification inconsistencies in glioblastoma but also suggests that biological variability, abnormal data distribution, and non-linear relationships among genes may be responsible for a proportionally larger component of classification error. These findings may have important implications for both glioblastoma research and for translational application of other large-volume biological databases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21829433
"""Hypoxia induces H19 expression through direct and indirect Hif-1alpha activity, promoting oncogenic effects in glioblastoma.""","""H19 expression is elevated in many human tumors including glioblastomas, suggesting an oncogenic role for the long noncoding RNA; yet the upregulation of H19 in glioblastomas remains unclear. Here we report that hypoxia significantly stimulated H19 expression in glioblastoma cell lines, which was related to hypoxia-inducible factors 1α (Hif-1α). Hif-1α promoted H19 expression in U87 and U251 cells. Meanwhile PTEN is an advantageous factor to affect H19 expression, through attenuating Hif-1α stability. Hif-1α also positively correlates with H19 in human glioblastoma samples depending on PTEN status. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays showed that Hif-1α induced H19 transcription through directly binding to the H19 promoter. Furthermore, Hif-1α upregulated specific protein 1 (SP1) expression in glioblastomas cells in vitro and in vivo, and SP1 also strongly interacted with the H19 promoter to promote H19 expression under hypoxia. We also showed that H19 acts as a molecular sponge that binds miR-181d, relieving inhibition of β-catenin expression. Therefore, H19 participates in hypoxia-driven migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells. In summary, our results uncover the mechanisms that stimulate H19 expression under hypoxia to promote malignant effects in glioblastomas and suggest H19 might be a promising therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28327666

These cells generate a specific tumor phenotype, but no link with tumor location or molecular characteristics has ever been made. Methods: Two cells lines, established from cell-dissociated glioblastomas and A2B5+ magnetic cell sorting, were used to decipher the mechanisms of cell migration in glioblastomas. GBM6 was derived from a glioblastoma close to the subventricular zone, whereas GBM9 was derived from a cortical glioblastoma and contained a high number of CD133(+) cells. Results: Orthotopic injections in both the subventricular zone and the cortex of nude mice showed that GBM6 and GBM9 cells had a differential pattern of migration that mirrored that of adult and fetal normal neural stem cells, respectively. GBM6 demonstrated higher tumorigenicity than GBM9, and whichever cell line was injected, subventricular zone-implanted tumors were larger than cortical ones. In vitro, GBM6 and GBM9 displayed high autorenewal and proliferation rates, and their expression profiles and genomic status showed that they had distinctive molecular signatures: GBM6 was classified as a mesenchymal glioblastoma and GBM9 as a proneural glioblastoma. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings suggest that tumor location in addition to molecular signature influence tumor growth and migration pattern.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21989663
"""The prognostic IDH1( R132 ) mutation is associated with reduced NADP+-dependent IDH activity in glioblastoma.""","""Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) occur at high frequency in gliomas and seem to be a prognostic factor for survival in glioblastoma patients. In our set of 98 glioblastoma patients, IDH1 ( R132 ) mutations were associated with improved survival of 1 year on average, after correcting for age and other variables with Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with IDH1 mutations were on average 17 years younger than patients without mutation. Mutated IDH1 has a gain of function to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate by NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, but it is unknown whether NADPH production in gliomas is affected by IDH1 mutations. We assessed the effect of IDH1 (R132 ) mutations on IDH-mediated NADPH production in glioblastomas in situ. Metabolic mapping and image analysis was applied to 51 glioblastoma samples of which 16 carried an IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. NADP+-dependent IDH activity was determined in comparison with activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and all other NADPH-producing dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The occurrence of IDH1 mutations correlated with approx. twofold diminished NADP+-dependent IDH activity, whereas activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and the other NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases was not affected in situ in glioblastoma. The total NADPH production capacity in glioblastoma was provided for 65% by IDH activity and the occurrence of IDH1 (R132 ) mutation reduced this capacity by 38%. It is concluded that NADPH production is hampered in glioblastoma with IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. Moreover, mutated IDH1 consumes rather than produces NADPH, thus likely lowering NADPH levels even further. The low NADPH levels may sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy, thus explaining the prolonged survival of patients with mutated glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20127344
"""Spinal Drop Metastasis of Glioblastoma-Two Case Reports, Clinicopathologic Features, Current Modalities of Evaluation, and Treatment with a Review of the Literature.""","""Background: Glioblastomas (World Health Organization grade IV) are aggressive primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. Spinal metastasis occurs supposedly in 2%-5% of patients. This percentage may be only the tip of iceberg because most succumb to the disease before clinical detection and few documented cases are reported. Case descriptions: A 45-year-old man presented with history of diplopia and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a left cerebellar space-occupying lesion. The histopathology was consistent with glioblastoma. The patient underwent adjuvant chemoradiation. A year later, he presented with seizures, worsening headache, neck stiffness, and low back pain. Imaging showed metastasis to the S1/S2 region of the spinal canal. A 29-year-old man presented with episodic headaches associated with nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and imbalance while walking. Computed tomography of the brain showed a hypodense lesion involving the left midbrain, pons, and left middle cerebellar peduncle, causing fourth ventricular pressure with obstructive hydrocephalus. A navigation-guided biopsy of the brainstem lesion confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma World Health Organization grade IV, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (R132 H) and H3K27M negative. Isocitrate dehydrogenase gene sequencing was suggested. The patient was referred for chemoradiation. During treatment, he worsened neurologically and developed axial neck and back pain. Neuraxis screening showed disseminated leptomeningeal spread, which was confirmed on dural biopsy. Conclusions: Spinal and dural metastasis should always be suspected in patients with glioblastoma with signs and symptoms not explained by primary lesion. A regular protocol with postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging before and after initial surgery is mandatory to detect spinal metastasis before it becomes clinically apparent, thereby improving the prognosis and quality of life in patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33161132

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 151 patients who were diagnosed with a glioblastoma between 2007 and 2011 and underwent complete surgical resection closely followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Results: We observed a significant tendency toward communicating hydrocephalus in cases of ventricular opening during surgical tumor resection (Fisher's exact test p<0.001) and a noticeable, although not statistically significant, correlation between the onset of communicating hydrocephalus and evidence of leptomeningeal tumor dissemination (Fisher's exact test p=0.067). Additionally, there was a trend toward frontal tumor location and a larger tumor volume in patients with communicating hydrocephalus. The majority of patients suffering from communicating hydrocephalus received a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt implantation after radiation therapy (63.6%, Fisher's exact test p=0.000).

"""CUX1 stimulates APE1 enzymatic activity and increases the resistance of glioblastoma cells to the mono-alkylating agent temozolomide.""","""Background: Cut Like homeobox 1 (CUX1), which encodes an auxiliary factor in base excision repair, resides on 7q22.1, the most frequently and highly amplified chromosomal region in glioblastomas. The resistance of glioblastoma cells to the mono-alkylating agent temozolomide is determined to some extent by the activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). Methods: To monitor the effect of CUX1 and its CUT domains on APE1 activity, DNA repair assays were performed with purified proteins and cell extracts. CUX1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a tumor microarray of 150 glioblastoma samples. The effect of CUX1 knockdown and overexpression on the resistance of glioblastoma cell lines to temozolomide was investigated. Results: We show that CUT domains stimulate APE1 activity. In agreement with these findings, CUX1 knockdown causes an increase in the number of abasic sites in genomic DNA and a decrease in APE1 activity as measured in cell extracts. Conversely, ectopic CUX1 expression increases APE1 activity and lowers the number of abasic sites. Having established that CUX1 is expressed at high levels in most glioblastomas, we next show that the resistance of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide and to a combined treatment of temozolomide and ionizing radiation is reduced following CUX1 knockdown, but increased by overexpression of CUX1 or a short protein containing only 2 CUT domains, which is active in DNA repair but devoid of transcriptional activity. Conclusion: These findings indicate that CUX1 expression level impacts on the response of glioblastoma cells to treatment and identifies the CUT domains as potential therapeutic targets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29036362

Molecular genetic studies generally involve searching for candidate proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes by comparing DNA from tumor material with constitutional (germline) DNA. However, it remains difficult to distinguish causative genetic aberrations from chaotic neoplastic processes, and studies so far have not yielded consistent information on the location of such causative genetic lesions.

We hypothesized that TILs in glioblastoma are associated with molecular alterations, histologies, and survival. Experimental design: We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate molecular, histologic, and clinical correlates of TILs in glioblastomas. Lymphocytes were categorized as absent, present, or abundant in histopathologic images from 171 TCGA glioblastomas. Associations were examined between lymphocytes and histologic features, mutations, copy number alterations, CpG island methylator phenotype, transcriptional class, and survival. We validated histologic findings using CD3G gene expression. Results: We found a positive correlation between TILs and glioblastomas with gemistocytes, sarcomatous cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells. Lymphocytes were enriched in the mesenchymal transcriptional class and strongly associated with mutations in NF1 and RB1. These mutations are frequent in the mesenchymal class and characteristic of gemistocytic, sarcomatous, epithelioid, and giant cell histologies. Conversely, TILs were rare in glioblastomas with small cells and oligodendroglioma components. Lymphocytes were depleted in the classical transcriptional class and in EGF receptor (EGFR)-amplified and homozygous PTEN-deleted glioblastomas. These alterations are characteristic of glioblastomas with small cells and glioblastomas of the classical transcriptional class. No association with survival was shown. Conclusions: TILs were enriched in glioblastomas of the mesenchymal class, strongly associated with mutations in NF1 and RB1 and typical of histologies characterized by these mutations.

The mechanisms underlying GSCs resistance to TMZ are not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged to play important roles in tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Previous study showed that miR-125b was necessary for GSCs fission and for making stem cells insensitive to chemotherapy. Thus, exploring the functions and mechanisms of miR-125b action on TMZ-treated GSCs would be valuable. In this study, we found that miR-125b was up-regulated in TMZ-resistant cells, inhibition of which caused a marked increase of TMZ-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent decrease in the resistance to TMZ in GSCs. Moreover, we demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak1) was a direct target of miR-125b. Down-regulation of Bak1 inhibited TMZ-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to TMZ. Restoring Bak1 expression recovered TMZ sensitivity on GSCs.

HGF also mediates migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to sites of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, MSC show tropism for glioblastomas, which is exploited in gene therapy to deliver the therapeutics to the tumor cells. Here, we have studied whether HGF contributes to the recruitment of MSC by glioblastoma cells and whether aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (ALA/PDT), a novel therapeutic approach that induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, affects HGF release and this migratory response. MSC expressed the HGF receptor MET and migrated towards U87 and U251 glioblastoma spheroids. Migration increased significantly when spheroids were subjected to ALA/PDT, which was associated with induction of apoptosis and up-regulation of HGF. Neutralizing HGF resulted in significant inhibition of MSC migration towards untreated as well as ALA/PDT-treated spheroids. Thus, glioblastoma cells express HGF, which contributes to the attraction of MSC. ALA/PDT induces apoptosis and augments HGF release causing enhanced MSC migration towards the tumor cells. ALA/PDT may therefore be exploited to improve targeting of MSC delivered gene therapy, but it may also constitute a risk in terms of beneficial effects for the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333382

To evaluate the potential for p53 gene therapy of glioblastoma, we have analyzed the response of human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo to experimental therapy with replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type p53 (rAd-p53). Western blot analyses showed high-level expression of p53 protein after treatment with rAd-p53, and transgene expression was dependent on promoter strength. A p53-specific dose-dependent inhibition of in vitro cellular proliferation was observed in 5 of 6 cell lines, and growth inhibition corresponded to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and expression. p53-specific cell death was quantitated by release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Fragmentation of DNA into nucleosomal oligomers and the occurrence of a hypodiploid cell population detected by flow cytometry provided evidence for apoptosis. Studies in nude mice demonstrated that ex vivo infection with rAd-p53 suppressed the tumorigenic potential of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, direct injection of rAd-p53 into established s.c. xenografts inhibited tumor growth.

Patients and methods: We used accelerated failure time (AFT) modeling using data from 721 newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (from 1993 to 2010) to model the factors affecting individualized survival after surgical resection, and we used the model to construct probabilistic, patient-specific tools for survival prediction. We validated this model with independent data from 109 patients from a second institution. Results: AFT modeling using age, Karnofsky performance score, EOR, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy produced a continuous, nonlinear, multivariable survival model for glioblastoma. The median personalized predictive error was 4.37 months, representing a more than 20% improvement over current methods. Subsequent model-based calculations yield patient-specific predictions of the incremental effects of EOR and adjuvant therapy on survival. Conclusion: Nonlinear, multivariable AFT modeling outperforms current methods for estimating individual survival after glioblastoma resection. The model produces personalized survival curves and quantifies the relationship between variables modulating patient-specific survival. This approach provides comprehensive, personalized, probabilistic, and clinically relevant information regarding the anticipated course of disease, the overall prognosis, and the patient-specific influence of EOR and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The continuous, nonlinear relationship identified between expected median survival and EOR argues against a surgical management strategy based on rigid EOR thresholds and instead provides the first explicit evidence supporting a maximum safe resection approach to glioblastoma surgery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24516010
"""Cochlear implants in the etiopathogenesis of glioblastoma--an interesting observation or independent finding?""","""Various risk factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas including ionizing radiation. Recent evidence has suggested a possible association between exposure to nonionizing radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) generated from mobile phones and wireless devices to cause malignant transformation of the neuroglial cells, albeit this is widely debated. In this report, we discuss the development of glioblastoma in two geopolitically unrelated patients, an elderly male from the United States and a middle-aged woman from Sweden, with long-standing cochlear implants (CI). We hypothesize that the low-frequency RF-EMF emanating from the transcutaneous link of the CI prosthesis over a long period has potentially triggered tumor development in these patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26858207
"""Classification of microvascular patterns via cluster analysis reveals their prognostic significance in glioblastoma.""","""There are limited researches focusing on microvascular patterns (MVPs) in human glioblastoma and their prognostic impact. We evaluated MVPs of 78 glioblastomas by CD34/periodic acid-Schiff dual staining and by cluster analysis of the percentage of microvascular area for distinct microvascular formations. The distribution of 5 types of basic microvascular formations, that is, microvascular sprouting (MS), vascular cluster (VC), vascular garland (VG), glomeruloid vascular proliferation (GVP), and vasculogenic mimicry (VM), was variable. Accordingly, cluster analysis classified MVPs into 2 types: type I MVP displayed prominent MSs and VCs, whereas type II MVP had numerous VGs, GVPs, and VMs. By analyzing the proportion of microvascular area for each type of formation, we determined that glioblastomas with few MSs and VCs had many GVPs and VMs, and vice versa. VG seemed to be a transitional type of formation. In case of type I MVP, expression of Ki-67 and p53 but not MGMT was significantly higher as compared with those of type II MVP (P < .05). Survival analysis showed that the type of MVPs presented as an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (both P < .001). Type II MVP had a more negative influence on PFS and OS than did type I MVP. We conclude that the heterogeneous MVPs in glioblastoma can be categorized properly by certain histopathologic and statistical analyses and may influence clinical outcome.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25455996
"""Molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas: does location matter?""","""Glioblastomas in adults are highly heterogeneous tumors that can develop throughout the brain. To date no predictive-location marker has been identified. We previously derived two glioblastoma cell lines from cortical and periventricular locations and demonstrated distinct transcriptomic profiles. Based on these preliminary results, the aim of this study was to correlate glioblastoma locations with the expression of ten selected genes (VEGFC, FLT4, MET, HGF, CHI3L1, PROM1, NOTCH1, DLL3, PDGFRA, BCAN). Fifty nine patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were retrospectively included. Tumors were classified into cortical and periventricular locations, which were subsequently segregated according to cerebral lobes involved: cortical fronto-parietal (C-FP), cortical temporal (C-T), periventricular fronto-parietal (PV-FP), periventricular temporal (PV-T), and periventricular occipital (PV-O). Gene expression levels were determined using RT-qPCR. Compared to cortical glioblastomas, periventricular glioblastomas were characterized by a higher expression of two mesenchymal genes, VEGFC (p = 0.001) and HGF (p = 0.001). Among cortical locations, gene expressions were homogeneous. In contrast, periventricular locations exhibited distinct expression profiles. PV-T tumors were associated with higher expression of two proneural and cancer stem cell genes, NOTCH1 (p = 0.028) and PROM1 (p = 0.033) while PV-FP tumors were characterized by high expression of a mesenchymal gene, CHI3L1 (p = 0.006). Protein expression of NOTCH1 was correlated with RNA expression levels. PV-O glioblastomas were associated with lower expression of VEGFC (p = 0.032) than other periventricular locations, whereas MET overexpression remained exceptional. These data suggest a differential gene expression profile according to initial glioblastoma location.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26637806
"""Diffusion tensor imaging discriminates between glioblastoma and cerebral metastases in vivo.""","""In a prospective study, patients with a radiologically proven brain tumour underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) prior to definitive diagnosis and treatment. Twenty-eight patients with a histologically proven glioblastoma or metastasis were included in the study. Following the definition of regions of interest, DTI metrics [mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)] were calculated for the tumour volume and the surrounding region of peritumoral oedema. These metrics were then subjected to logistic regression to investigate their ability to discriminate between glioblastomas and cerebral metastases. A cross-validation was performed to investigate the ability of the model to predict tumour. The logistic regression analysis correctly distinguished glioblastoma in 15 of 16 cases (93.8%) and metastasis in 11 of 12 cases (91.7%). Cross-validation resulted in the model correctly predicting 14 of 16 (87.5%) glioblastomas and 10 of 12 (83.3%) metastases studied. MD was significantly higher (p = 0.02) and FA was significantly lower (p = 0.04) within the oedema surrounding metastases than within the oedema around glioblastomas. MD was significantly higher (p = 0.02) within the tumour volume of the glioblastomas. Our results demonstrate that, when DTI metrics from the tumour volume and surrounding peritumoral oedema are studied in combination, glioblastoma can be reliably discriminated from cerebral metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20665905

To correlate gene expression signatures of glioblastoma cell lines or tumors with response to chemotherapy (DeLay et al., Clin Cancer Res 18(10):2930-2942, 2012). ii. To correlate gene expression patterns with biological features like proliferation or invasiveness of the glioblastoma cells (Jiang et al., PLoS One 8(6):e66008, 2013). iii.

Our aim was to assess this risk. Methods: Our institution's database (from 2005 to 2017) was screened for patients with GBM or MET and AF with an indication for AC according to their CHA2DS2VASc stroke risk score (≥ 2). Required follow-up was at least 3 months. AC was either performed with heparins, phenprocoumon or non-Vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. Applying the propensity score approach, patient cohorts (matched according to primary tumor, age, sex) were generated (GBM [or MET] with AF ± AC, GBM [or MET] without AF/AC, no GBM [or MET] but AF on AC). ICH was defined as clinical deterioration caused by new blood on imaging. A log rank test was performed to compare the risk for ICH between the three groups. Results: In total, 104 patients were identified of which 49 with GBM (37% on AC) and 37 with MET (46% on AC) were successfully matched. Median follow up was 8.6 and 7.2 months, respectively. ICH occurred in 10.2% of GBM + AF and 12.2% GBM-AF, whereas 8% of patients with AF on AC suffered ICH (p = 0.076). 13.5% of patients with MET + AF had ICHs, in the controls it was 16% for MET-AF and 8% for AF on AC (p = 0.11).

Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative measurement of T1 (qT1) discovers a subtle enhancement in GBM patients that is invisible in standard MRI. We assessed the volume change of this 'cloudy' enhancement during radio-chemotherapy and its impact on patients' progression-free survival (PFS). We enrolled 18 GBM patients in this observational, prospective cohort study and measured 3T-MRI pre- and post contrast agent with standard T1-weighted (T1w) and with sequences to quantify T1 before radiation, and at 6-week intervals during radio-chemotherapy. We measured contrast enhancement by subtracting pre from post contrast contrast images, yielding relative signal increase ∆T1w and relative T1 shortening ∆qT1. On ∆qT1, we identified a solid and a cloudy-enhancing compartment and evaluated the impact of their therapy-related volume change upon PFS. In ∆qT1 maps cloudy-enhancing compartments were found in all but two patients at baseline and in all patients during therapy. The qT1 decrease in the cloudy-enhancing compartment post contrast was 21.64% versus 1.96% in the contralateral control tissue (P < 0.001). It was located at the margin of solid enhancement which was also seen on T1w. In contrast, the cloudy-enhancing compartment was visually undetectable on ∆T1w. A volume decrease of more than 21.4% of the cloudy-enhancing compartment at first follow-up predicted longer PFS (P = 0.038). Cloudy-enhancing compartment outside the solid contrast-enhancing area of GBM is a new observation which is only visually detectable with qT1-mapping and may represent tumor infiltration. Its early volume decrease predicts a longer PFS in GBM patients during standard radio-chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27891815

Thus, glioblastomas metabolism is now an area of intense research, wherein was documented a high heterogeneity in energy metabolism and in particular in mitochondrial OxPhos. We report results gained by investigating mitochondrial OxPhos and bioenergetics, in a model of three human glioblastoma cell lines characterized by a different PTEN gene status. Functional data are analysed in relation to the expression levels of some main transcription factors and signalling proteins, which can be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. Collectively, our observations indicate for the three cell lines a similar bioenergetic phenotype maintaining a certain degree of mitochondrial oxidative activity, with some difference for PTEN-wild type SF767 cells respect to PTEN-deleted A172 and U87MG characterized by a loss-of-function point mutation of PTEN. SF767 has lower ATP content and higher ADP/ATP ratio, higher AMPK activating-phosphorylation evoking energy impairment, higher OxPhos complexes and PGC1α-Sirt3-p53 protein abundance, in line with a higher respiration. Finally, SF767 shows a similar mitochondrial energy supply, but higher non-phosphorylating respiration linked to dissipation of protonmotive force.

We aimed to determine whether glioblastomas demonstrating a substantial proportion (>33%) of nCET can be sub-classified by different morphologic pattern of nCET. We then assessed whether this improves the ability of MRI to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation status and whether this has prognostic significance independent of IDH1 mutation status. Pre-operative MRIs of patients with a new diagnosis of glioblastoma were reviewed. Tumours with >33% nCET were sub-classified by the dominant morphologic pattern of nCET: mass-like expansion, white matter dissemination, grey matter dissemination or a combination. IDH1 mutation status (by immunohistochemistry) and survival were compared for each pattern. 153 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 34 patients demonstrated >33% nCET. 10 patients had a significant mass-like component, either as the dominant pattern (n=4) or as part of a mixed pattern (n=6). The 10 patients with a significant mass-like component had longer survival than those without (median 387days, compared to 241days), though this was not statistically significant (p=0.242). Three patients had R132H-IDH1 mutations and >33% nCET, and all three had a mass-like component. Using the presence of a mass-like component of nCET for predicting IDH1 mutation status improved the positive predictive value, specificity and overall accuracy of MRI.

In this study, we determine the rate of complications and performance decline after resections and biopsies in a national quality registry, their risk factors and the risk-standardized variation between institutions. Methods: Data from all 3288 adults with first-time glioblastoma surgery at 13 hospitals were obtained from a prospective population-based Quality Registry Neuro Surgery in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2017. Patients were stratified by biopsies and resections. Complications were categorized as Clavien-Dindo grades II and higher. Performance decline was considered a deterioration of more than 10 Karnofsky points at 6 weeks. Risk factors were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Patient-specific expected and observed complications and performance declines were summarized for institutions and analyzed in funnel plots. Results: For 2271 resections, the overall complication rate was 20 % and 16 % declined in performance. For 1017 biopsies, the overall complication rate was 11 % and 30 % declined in performance. Patient-related characteristics were significant risk factors for complications and performance decline, i.e. higher age, lower baseline Karnofsky, higher ASA classification, and the surgical procedure. Hospital characteristics, i.e. case volume, university affiliation and biopsy percentage, were not. In three institutes the observed complication rate was significantly less than expected. In one institute significantly more performance declines were observed than expected, and in one institute significantly less.

A subset of these cancers develops from lower-grade gliomas and can thus be clinically classified as 'secondary,' whereas some glioblastomas occur with no prior evidence of a lower-grade tumor and can be clinically classified as 'primary.' Substantial genetic differences between these groups of glioblastomas have been identified previously. We used large-scale expression analyses to identify glioblastoma-associated genes (GAG) that are associated with a more malignant phenotype via comparison with lower-grade astrocytomas. We have further defined gene expression differences that distinguish primary and secondary glioblastomas. GAGs distinct to primary or secondary tumors provided information on the heterogeneous properties and apparently distinct oncogenic mechanisms of these tumors. Secondary GAGs primarily include mitotic cell cycle components, suggesting the loss of function in prominent cell cycle regulators, whereas primary GAGs highlight genes typical of a stromal response, suggesting the importance of extracellular signaling. Immunohistochemical staining of glioblastoma tissue arrays confirmed expression differences.

"""Marked genomic differences characterize primary and secondary glioblastoma subtypes and identify two distinct molecular and clinical secondary glioblastoma entities.""","""Glioblastoma is classified into two subtypes on the basis of clinical history: 'primary glioblastoma' arising de novo without detectable antecedent disease and 'secondary glioblastoma' evolving from a low-grade astrocytoma. Despite their distinctive clinical courses, they arrive at an indistinguishable clinical and pathologic end point highlighted by widespread invasion and resistance to therapy and, as such, are managed clinically as if they are one disease entity. Because the life history of a cancer cell is often reflected in the pattern of genomic alterations, we sought to determine whether primary and secondary glioblastomas evolve through similar or different molecular pathogenetic routes. Clinically annotated primary and secondary glioblastoma samples were subjected to high-resolution copy number analysis using oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization. Unsupervised classification using genomic nonnegative matrix factorization methods identified three distinct genomic subclasses. Whereas one corresponded to clinically defined primary glioblastomas, the remaining two stratified secondary glioblastoma into two genetically distinct cohorts. Thus, this global genomic analysis showed wide-scale differences between primary and secondary glioblastomas that were previously unappreciated, and has shown for the first time that secondary glioblastoma is heterogeneous in its molecular pathogenesis. Consistent with these findings, analysis of regional recurrent copy number alterations revealed many more events unique to these subclasses than shared. The pathobiological significance of these shared and subtype-specific copy number alterations is reinforced by their frequent occurrence, resident genes with clear links to cancer, recurrence in diverse cancer types, and apparent association with clinical outcome. We conclude that glioblastoma is composed of at least three distinct molecular subtypes, including novel subgroups of secondary glioblastoma, which may benefit from different therapeutic strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17114236

Here, we applied FAP-specific PET imaging to gliomas. We analyzed the target affinity and specificity of two FAP ligands (FAPI-02 and FAPI-04) in vitro, and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice in vivo. Clinically, we used 68Ga-labeled FAPI-02/04 for PET imaging in 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas, 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). Methods: For binding studies with 177Lu-radiolabeled FAPI-02/04, we used the glioblastoma cell line U87MG, FAP-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, and CD26-transfected human embryonic kidney cells. For pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies, U87MG-xenografted mice were injected with 68Ga-labeled compounds followed by small-animal PET imaging and 177Lu-labeled FAPI-02/04, respectively. Clinical PET/CT scans were performed 30 min post intravenous administration of 68Ga-FAPI-02/04. PET and MRI scans were co-registrated. Immunohistochemistry was done on 14 gliomas using a FAP-specific antibody. Results: FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 showed high binding specificity to FAP. FAPI-04 demonstrated higher tumor accumulation and delayed elimination compared with FAPI-02 in preclinical studies. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV, but not grade II, IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake. In glioblastomas, we observed spots with increased uptake in projection on contrast-enhancing areas. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-positive cells with mainly elongated cell bodies and perivascular FAP-positive cells in glioblastomas and an anaplastic IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Conclusions: Using FAP-specific PET imaging, increased tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytomas, but not in diffuse astrocytomas, may allow non-invasive distinction between low-grade IDH-mutant and high-grade gliomas.

"""Glioma occurrence after sellar irradiation: case report and review.""","""Objective: Tumor neogenesis is an uncommon but known consequence after therapeutic irradiation of the central nervous system. Causative agents for glioma induction remain unknown, but laboratory and clinical data suggest a possible role for radiation as a promotor. In the treatment of both pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas, adjunctive conventional radiation therapy has long played a role. Clinical presentation: This report details two cases in which patients received standard sellar irradiation for growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas and later were diagnosed with gliomas, after a latency period of 11 and 18 years, respectively. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the literature with 30 reports of gliomas developing after conventional radiation for treatment of pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas is presented. The mean dose for craniopharyngiomas (n = 8) was 5800 cGy, with a mean latency of 11.5 years from initial diagnosis to the eventual discovery of the gliomas. The mean dose for the treatment of pituitary adenomas (n = 24) was 5300 cGy, with a mean latency of 10.4 years. Conclusion: Typical features of the resulting gliomas included presentation in young patients, histologically high grades, and occurrence within the temporal lobe. A large proportion of gliomas were associated with growth hormone-secreting adenomas. This review assesses the implication of doses of conventional radiotherapy that were previously thought to be benign and concludes that although radiation-associated gliomas are uncommon, they represent a potentially devastating long-term risk.

Dephosphorylation of serine 412 is necessary for Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase transactivation. We hypothesized that altered beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation and activation status could play a role in gliomagenesis. Using monoclonal anti-phospho-(serine 412)- and total beta-arrestin 1 antibodies, we performed immunohistochemistry on 126 human glioma samples and 7 nonneoplastic controls and Western blot analysis on 5 glioblastomas and 5 nonneoplastic controls. We found high constitutive beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly in neurons and neuropil. Most Grade II and III gliomas retained high beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation. By contrast, most of the glioblastoma samples (58/81) showed nearly complete beta-arrestin 1 dephosphorylation by immunohistochemistry and decreased relative phosphorylation by Western blot. Expression of constitutively activated epidermal growth factor receptor vIII in U251 cells caused decreased beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation without altering total beta-arrestin 1 levels.

"""Genes and pathways driving glioblastomas in humans and murine disease models.""","""Human malignant gliomas arise from neural progenitor cells and/or dedifferentiated astrocytes. By now, they are genetically so well characterized that several murine glioma models have emerged that faithfully reiterate the typical histological features of the disease. In experimental animals, only one or two elements of the growth factor/Ras, PI3K/PTEN/PKB, p53/ARF/HDM2, and p16/Rb/cyclinD/CDK4 pathways are targeted. In human gliomas, many additional genes and pathways are targeted due to a most severe mutator phenotype that leads to the accumulation of countless epigenetic and genetic alterations. Changes that convey a growth advantage are selected for, leading to overgrowth of precursor cell populations with increasingly malignant tumor cell clones. While murine models represent a powerful tool for elucidating the role of genetic pathways, mechanisms of response and resistance to new therapeutic agents might be fundamentally different due to the high degree of genomic instability in the human disease. In fact, little is known about the molecular causes of genomic instability involved in gliomas, except for the rare Turcot's syndrome, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, and the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ape-1.

"""The RNA-binding protein SERBP1 functions as a novel oncogenic factor in glioblastoma by bridging cancer metabolism and epigenetic regulation.""","""Background: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) function as master regulators of gene expression. Alterations in RBP expression and function are often observed in cancer and influence critical pathways implicated in tumor initiation and growth. Identification and characterization of oncogenic RBPs and their regulatory networks provide new opportunities for targeted therapy. Results: We identify the RNA-binding protein SERBP1 as a novel regulator of glioblastoma (GBM) development. High SERBP1 expression is prevalent in GBMs and correlates with poor patient survival and poor response to chemo- and radiotherapy. SERBP1 knockdown causes delay in tumor growth and impacts cancer-relevant phenotypes in GBM and glioma stem cell lines. RNAcompete identifies a GC-rich region as SERBP1-binding motif; subsequent genomic and functional analyses establish SERBP1 regulation role in metabolic routes preferentially used by cancer cells. An important consequence of these functions is SERBP1 impact on methionine production. SERBP1 knockdown decreases methionine levels causing a subsequent reduction in histone methylation as shown for H3K27me3 and upregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and function. Further analysis demonstrates that several of these genes are downregulated in GBM, potentially through epigenetic silencing as indicated by the presence of H3K27me3 sites. Conclusions: SERBP1 is the first example of an RNA-binding protein functioning as a central regulator of cancer metabolism and indirect modulator of epigenetic regulation in GBM. By bridging these two processes, SERBP1 enhances glioma stem cell phenotypes and contributes to GBM poorly differentiated state.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762776
"""Metformin repositioning as antitumoral agent: selective antiproliferative effects in human glioblastoma stem cells, via inhibition of CLIC1-mediated ion current.""","""Epidemiological and preclinical studies propose that metformin, a first-line drug for type-2 diabetes, exerts direct antitumor activity. Although several clinical trials are ongoing, the molecular mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here we show that chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) is a direct target of metformin in human glioblastoma cells. Metformin exposure induces antiproliferative effects in cancer stem cell-enriched cultures, isolated from three individual WHO grade IV human glioblastomas. These effects phenocopy metformin-mediated inhibition of a chloride current specifically dependent on CLIC1 functional activity. CLIC1 ion channel is preferentially active during the G1-S transition via transient membrane insertion. Metformin inhibition of CLIC1 activity induces G1 arrest of glioblastoma stem cells. This effect was time-dependent, and prolonged treatments caused antiproliferative effects also for low, clinically significant, metformin concentrations. Furthermore, substitution of Arg29 in the putative CLIC1 pore region impairs metformin modulation of channel activity. The lack of drugs affecting cancer stem cell viability is the main cause of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We identified CLIC1 not only as a modulator of cell cycle progression in human glioblastoma stem cells but also as the main target of metformin's antiproliferative activity, paving the way for novel and needed pharmacological approaches to glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25361004
"""[Glioblastoma: clinical, radiological and biological prognostic factors].""","""The main prognostic factors of glioblastomas (GBM) are age, neurological and cognitive status, frontal tumor location, extent of surgical resection, adjuvant therapies received, presence of IDH1 mutations, and MGMT expression. Other molecular prognostic factors have been proposed, such as mutations of TP53 and PTEN, amplification of EGFR, and deletion of 10q, but their prognostic values remain controversial. MGMT promotor gene methylation is correlated with higher chemosensitivity and consequently is a good prognostic factor only in patients treated with chemotherapy. In the future, the gene expression profile will probably be a stronger prognostic factor than histological grade, but the most relevant gene clusters, whose expression may be correlated with survival, remain to be identified. Long survivors are characterized by younger age, better neurological status, and a more aggressive therapeutic strategy. In daily clinical practice, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classifications can estimate the median survival of a given patient according to several basic factors. RPA class is also important so as to adapt individual therapeutic strategies, considering that the benefit of adjuvant treatments tends to decrease in the highest RPA class patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20869088
"""STAT5b is a marker of poor prognosis, rather than a therapeutic target in glioblastomas.""","""The copy number and mRNA expression of STAT5b were assessed in samples from the TCGA repository of glioblastomas (GBM). The activation of this transcription factor was analyzed on tissue microarrays comprising 392 WHO 2016 GBM samples from our clinical practice. These data were correlated with patient survival using multivariable Cox analysis and, for a subset of 167 tumors, with signs of tumor invasiveness on the MRI. The effects of STAT5b knockdown by siRNA were assessed on the growth, therapeutic resistance, invasion and migration of GBM cell lines U87, U87‑EGFRVIII and LN18 and primary cultures GM2 and GM3. The activation, but not the copy number or the mRNA expression of nuclear transcription factor STAT5b expression correlated inversely with patient survival independently of IDH1R132H status, age, Karnofsky Performance Score, treatment and tumor volume. STAT5b inhibition neither altered the cell proliferation nor reduced the clonogenic proliferative potency of GBM cells, and did not sensitize them to the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation and temozolomide in vitro. STAT5b inhibition significantly increased GBM cell migration, but decreased the invasion of some GBM cells in vitro. There was no correlation between the activation of STAT5b in clinical tumors and the extent of invasion on MRI OF patients. In conclusion, STAT5b is frequently activated in GBM and correlates inversely with patient survival. It does not contribute to the growth and resistance of these tumors, and is thus rather a potential prognostic marker than a therapeutic target in these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36069226
"""[Clinicopathological diagnosis of gliomas by genotype analysis].""","""Currently, the use of microscopical examinations alone is insufficient for the histological classification and grading of gliomas. In recognition of the emerging role of molecular diagnostic approaches to glioma classification, the role of genetic profiles has been emphasized on, as in the distinct subtypes of glioma. Glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) may develop de novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from lower-grade astrocytomas (secondary glioblastomas) both glioblastomas show similar histological features. However, these subtypes of glioblastoma involve distinct disease entities that evolve through different genetic pathways and are likely to differ in prognosis and response to therapy. Oligodendroglioma is recognized as a particular subtype of gliomas that shows remarkable response to chemotherapy [procarbazine+CCNU+vincristine (PCV)], making their correct diagnosis important. However, the histological differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from diffuse astrocytoma could be highly subjective in cases without typical morphological features. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q is correlated with sensitivity to PCV chemotherapy with increased survival in anaplastic oligodendroglioma cases (WHO grade III). Similarly, combined LOH on 1p and 19q has been identified as a predictor of favorable overall survival in oligodendrogliomas. Additionally, the status of the O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase gene (O6-MGMT) is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously found methylation or expression mosaicism of O6-MGMT in gliomas, resulting in problems on tumor sampling and response to TMZ. An assessment of the O6-MGMT methylation mosaicism in heterogeneous glioma may provide a more accurate assessment for the response to TMZ. This article suggests that more biological and molecular approaches to brain tumor classification will provide improved means to treat these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19618854

However, there are some limits to this classification for insight into genetically and clinically distinction between pGBM and sGBM. The aim of this study is to characterize pGBM and sGBM associating with differential molecular subtype distribution. Whole transcriptome sequencing data was used to assess the distribution of molecular subtypes and genetic alterations in 88 pGBM and 34 sGBM in a Chinese population-based cohort, and the biological progression and prognostic impact were analyzed by combining clinical information. Forty-one percentage of pGBM were designated as Mesenchymal subtype, while only 15% were the Proneural subtype. However, sGBM displayed the opposite ratio of Mesenchymal (15%) and Proneural (44%) subtypes. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) were found to be highly concentrated in the Proneural subtypes. In addition, patients with sGBM were 10 years younger on average than those with pGBM, and exhibited clinical features of shorter overall survival and frontal lobe tumor location tendency. Furthermore, in sGBM, gene sets related to malignant progression were found to be enriched. Overall, these results reveal the intrinsic distinction between pGBM and sGBM, and provide insight into the genetic and clinical attributes of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25821160

Recurrent tumours of these patients were removed in 36 patients. Two patients developed multifocal spread of glioblastoma multiforme including spinal drop metastases.

"""Functional diversity of PFKFB3 splice variants in glioblastomas.""","""Tumor cells tend to metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. One of the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis is 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which is allosterically activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate which in turn is produced by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2 or PFKFB). Mounting evidence suggests that cancerous tissues overexpress the PFKFB isoenzyme, PFKFB3, being causing enhanced proliferation of cancer cells. Initially, six PFKFB3 splice variants with different C-termini have been documented in humans. More recently, additional splice variants with varying N-termini were discovered the functions of which are to be uncovered. Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest forms of brain tumors. Up to now, the role of PFKFB3 splice variants in the progression and prognosis of glioblastomas is only partially understood. In this study, we first re-categorized the PFKFB3 splice variant repertoire to simplify the denomination. We investigated the impact of increased and decreased levels of PFKFB3-4 (former UBI2K4) and PFKFB3-5 (former variant 5) on the viability and proliferation rate of glioblastoma U87 and HEK-293 cells. The simultaneous knock-down of PFKFB3-4 and PFKFB3-5 led to a decrease in viability and proliferation of U87 and HEK-293 cells as well as a reduction in HEK-293 cell colony formation. Overexpression of PFKFB3-4 but not PFKFB3-5 resulted in increased cell viability and proliferation. This finding contrasts with the common notion that overexpression of PFKFB3 enhances tumor growth, but instead suggests splice variant-specific effects of PFKFB3, apparently with opposing effects on cell behaviour. Strikingly, in line with this result, we found that in human IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, the PFKFB3-4 to PFKFB3-5 ratio was significantly shifted towards PFKFB3-4 when compared to control brain samples. Our findings indicate that the expression level of distinct PFKFB3 splice variants impinges on tumorigenic properties of glioblastomas and that splice pattern may be of important diagnostic value for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34234350
"""Phenotype vs genotype in the evolution of astrocytic brain tumors.""","""Astrocytic brain tumors are the most frequent human gliomas and they include a wide range of neoplasms with distinct clinical, histopathologic, and genetic features. Diffuse astrocytomas are predominantly located in the cerebral hemispheres of adults and have an inherent tendency to progress to anaplastic astrocytoma and (secondary) glioblastoma. The majority of glioblastomas develop de novo (primary glioblastomas), without an identifiable less-malignant precursor lesion. These subtypes of glioblastoma evolve through different genetic pathways, affect patients at different ages, and are likely to differ in their responses to therapy. Primary glioblastomas occur in older patients and typically show epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, PTEN mutations, p16 deletions, and, less frequently, MDM2 amplification. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and often contain TP53 mutations as their earliest detectable alteration. Morphologic variants of glioblastoma were shown to have intermediate clinical and genetic profiles. The giant cell glioblastoma clinically and genetically occupies a hybrid position between primary (de novo) and secondary glioblastomas. Gliosarcomas show identical gene mutations in the gliomatous and sarcomatous tumor components, which strongly supports the concept that there is a monoclonal origin for gliosarcomas and an evolution of the sarcomatous component due to aberrant mesenchymal differentiation in a highly malignant astrocytic neoplasm.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10669004
"""Scale to predict survival after surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Purpose: Despite initial treatment with surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) virtually always recurs. Surgery is sometimes recommended to treat recurrence. In this study, we sought to devise a preoperative scale that predicts survival after surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Patients and methods: The preoperative clinical and radiographic data of 34 patients who underwent re-operation of recurrent GBM tumors were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. The factors associated with decreased postoperative survival (P < .05) were used to devise a prognostic scale which was validated with a separate cohort of 109 patients. Results: The factors associated with poor postoperative survival were: tumor involvement of prespecified eloquent/critical brain regions (P = .021), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) < or = 80 (P = .030), and tumor volume > or = 50 cm(3) (P = .048). An additive scale (range, 0 to 3 points) comprised of these three variables distinguishes patients with good (0 points), intermediate (1 to 2 points), and poor (3 points) postoperative survival (median survival, 10.8, 4.5, and 1.0 months, respectively; P < .001). The scale identified three statistically distinct groups within the validation cohort as well (median survival, 9.2, 6.3, and 1.9 months, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion: We devised and validated a preoperative scale that identifies patients likely to have poor, intermediate, and good relative outcomes after surgical resection of a recurrent GBM tumor. Application of this simple scale may be useful in counseling patients regarding their treatment options and in designing clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20644085

Specifically, gene expression profiling studies revealed that matrix gla protein (MGP), whose function has traditionally been linked to inhibition of calcification of arteries and cartilage, is overexpressed in glioblastomas and associated with worse outcome. Methods: In order to analyze the role of MGP in glioblastomas, we performed expression, migration and proliferation studies. Results: Real-time PCR and ELISA assays confirmed overexpression of MGP in glioblastoma biopsy specimens and cell lines at mRNA and protein levels as compared to normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry verified positivity of glial tumor cells for MGP. RNAi-mediated knockdown of MGP in three glioma cell lines (U343MG, U373MG, H4) led to marked reduction of migration, as demonstrated by wound healing and transwell assays, while no effect on proliferation was seen. Conclusion: Our data suggest that upregulation of MGP (and possibly other ECM-related components as well) results in unfavorable prognosis via increased migration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19712474

"""Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics predict epidermal growth factor receptor amplification status in glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Two clinical-molecular glioblastoma subtypes have been described: 'primary' glioblastomas arise de novo in older patients and often overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); 'secondary' glioblastomas progress from lower-grade tumors in younger patients and commonly have TP53 mutations. EGFR overexpression correlates in experimental gliomas with increased angiogenesis, edema, and invasion. No radiographic predictors of molecular glioblastoma subtype are known. Experimental design: We retrospectively reviewed 75 glioblastomas, classified as TP53-mutated (n=11), EGFR-amplified (n=31), or neither (non-TP53/non-EGFR; n=33). Four variables were derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging: (a) T2/T1, the ratio of T2-bright volume to enclosed T1-enhancing volume; (b) percentage of tumor volume that was necrosis; and (c and d) T1 and T2 border sharpness coefficients (BSC), the rates of change in grayscale intensity of adjacent 0.02-cm2 voxels traversing the anterior, posterior, and lateral borders on T1-enhanced and T2 images. Results and conclusions: Mean T2/T1 was 4.7 for EGFR-amplified glioblastomas, greater than that of TP53-mutated glioblastomas (2.3) or non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (2.6; P<0.00005). All four tumors with T2/T1>7.2 were EGFR-amplified; 0 of 15 with T2/T1<4.7 underwent gross total resection. The mean T2 BSC of EGFR-amplified glioblastomas was 33.7, less sharp (P<0.0000005) than TP53-mutated (72.2) and non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (81.2). All 15 glioblastomas with T2 BSC<30.8 were EGFR-amplified. Percentage necrosis and T1 BSC did not differ between glioblastoma subtypes. The increased T2/T1 ratio and decreased T2 BSC in EGFR-overexpressing tumors are the first radiographic distinctions described between glioblastoma molecular subtypes.

"""Growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are primary malignant brain tumors with a dismal prognosis. Knowledge of growth rates and underlying growth dynamics is useful for understanding basic tumor biology, developing realistic tumor models, and planning treatment logistics. Methods: By using repeated pretreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from 106 patients (aged 26-83 years), we studied the growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo. Growth rates were calculated as specific growth rates and equivalent volume doubling times. The fit of different possible growth models was assessed using maximum likelihood estimations. Results: There were large variations in growth rates between patients. The median specific growth rate of the tumors was 1.4% per day, and the equivalent volume doubling time was 49.6 days. Exploring 3 different tumor growth models showed similar statistical fit for a Gompertzian growth model and a linear radial growth model and worse fit for an exponential growth model. However, large tumors had significantly lower growth rates than smaller tumors, supporting the assumption that glioblastomas reach a plateau phase and thus exhibit Gompertzian growth. Conclusion: Based on the fast growth rate of glioblastoma shown in this study, it is evident that poor treatment logistics will influence tumor size before surgery and can cause significant regrowth before adjuvant treatment. Since there is a known association between tumor volume, extent of surgical resection, and response to adjuvant therapy, it is likely that waiting times play a role in patient outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25758748
"""[Stem cells: implications in the development of brain tumors].""","""Stem cells are characterized by their capacity for self-renewal, for giving rise to new cells in specific tissues, and for maintaining this capacity throughout the entire life of their host. Stem cells are pluripotent and maintain continuous production of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Stem cells in brain tumors also proliferate, undergo self-renewal, and give rise to other poorly differentiated cells. Unlike non-tumor stem cells, tumor stem cells lack the normal mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation, resulting in uncontrolled production and incomplete differentiation of tumor cells. Discovering the role of tumor stem cells in the brain has given us a new perspective about the molecular pathways involved in signaling and about oncogenesis in the central nervous system; it can also help us explain the high rate of recurrence of some tumors and the diffuse nature of glioblastomas.

Loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway or activated PI3K/Akt pathway that drive increased proliferation, survival, neovascularization, glycolysis, and invasion is found in 70%-80% of malignant gliomas. Thus, PI3K is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant glioma. We report that a new irreversible PI3K inhibitor, PX-866, shows potent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma. PX-866 did not induce any apoptosis in glioma cells; however, an increase in autophagy was observed. PX-866 inhibited the invasive and angiogenic capabilities of cultured glioblastoma cells. In vivo, PX-866 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and increased the median survival time of animals with intracranial tumors. We also assessed the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a noninvasive method to monitor response to PX-866. Our findings show that PX-866 treatment causes a drop in the MRS-detectable choline-to-NAA, ratio and identify this partial normalization of the tumor metabolic profile as a biomarker of molecular drug action. Our studies affirm that the PI3K pathway is a highly specific molecular target for therapies for glioblastoma and other cancers with aberrant PI3K/PTEN expression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156803

During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. Significance: It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults.

We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the γ-interferon pathway.

Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 5 of 40 primary glioblastomas (12,5%). Primary GBM patients carrying IDH1 mutations were significantly younger, mean age of 41±5.06years, than patients with wild-type IDH1, mean age of 57±2,29years, p=0.011.

"""ell clusters isolation in glioblastomas and their functional and molecular characterization using new morphometric approaches.""","""Background: Digital pathology has come a long way in terms of creating tools to improve existing diagnostic approaches. However, several pathology fields, such as neuropathology, are still characterized by low coverage from machine learning tools and neural network analysis, which may be due to the complexity of the internal cellular and molecular structure of the corresponding neoplasms, including glioblastomas. Method: In the framework of this study, using advanced proprietary tools for obtaining images of histological slides and their deep morphometric analysis, we studied samples of 198 patients with glioblastoma with the selection of morphometric cell clusters. Also, cells of each cluster were isolated, and their proliferative, migratory, invasive activity, survival ability, aerobic glycolysis activity, and chemo- and radioresistance were studied. Results: Four morphometric clusters were identified, including small-cell cluster, paracirculonuclear cluster, hypochromic cluster, and macronuclear cluster, which significantly differed in morphometric parameters and functional parameters. Hypochromic cluster cells demonstrated the highest proliferation activity; macronuclear cluster was the most active glucose consumer; paracirculonuclear cluster had the most prominent migratory and invasive activity and hypoxia resistance; small-cell cluster demonstrated predominantly average values of all parameters. Moreover, additional analysis revealed the presence of a separate subcluster of stem cell elements that correspond in their molecular properties to glioma stem cells and are present in all four clusters. It also turned out that several key molecular parameters of glioblastoma, such as mutational modifications in the EGFR, PDGFRA, and NF1 genes, along with the molecular GBM subtype, are significantly correlated with the identified cell clusters.

TP53 mutations were a favorable prognostic factor independent of whether glioblastomas were primary or secondary. LOH1p or 19q, lesions suspected to be over-represented in long term survivors with malignant glioma, were not associated with better survival. However, the combination of LOH1p and LOH19q defined GBM patients with a significantly better survival.

"""The challenges of long-term treatment outcomes in adults with malignant gliomas.""","""Malignant gliomas are among the most devastating tumors, with survival only one to three years after diagnosis even with the best of treatments. For this reason, long-term follow-up has not been established. Patients who do survive have significant disabilities, which compromise patient and family quality of life (QOL). Side effects from a brain tumor are dependent on the location of the tumor in the brain and can cause significant cognitive, emotional, and social effects on patients and families. Surgical treatment options also are dependent on the location of the tumor in the brain, and some sites remain inoperable (e.g., brain stem, motor strip). Radiation therapy continues to remain the mainstay of treatment for this patient population. The advent of newer technologies in radiation and chemotherapy and the development of novel treatments have increased survival. As survival increases, QOL issues become more important to patients and families. Impairment, disability, and handicap are measurements of QOL used by healthcare professionals. A multitude of studies has produced evidence regarding the impact of tumor location and size on QOL, whereas other studies have demonstrated the effects that various treatment modalities have on QOL. Few studies actually have provided insight into the everyday consequences that tumors pose on patients. Understanding the significance and causes of these impairments, disabilities, and handicaps will assist oncology nurses in caring for this special population.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15354923
"""The zinc finger transcription factor ZFX is required for maintaining the tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma stem cells.""","""Glioblastomas are highly lethal brain tumors containing tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs). The molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the GSC phenotype are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger and X-linked transcription factor (ZFX) maintains GSC self-renewal and tumorigenic potential by upregulating c-Myc expression. ZFX is differentially expressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioma cells and neural progenitor cells. Disrupting ZFX by shRNA reduced c-Myc expression and potently inhibited GSC self-renewal and tumor growth. Ectopic expression of c-Myc to its endogenous level rescued the effects caused by ZFX disruption, supporting that ZFX controls GSC properties through c-Myc. Furthermore, ZFX binds to a specific sequence (GGGCCCCG) on the human c-Myc promoter to upregulate c-Myc expression. These data demonstrate that ZFX functions as a critical upstream regulator of c-Myc and plays essential roles in the maintenance of the GSC phenotype. This study also supports that c-Myc is a dominant driver linking self-renewal to malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24831540
"""Improved survival for elderly married glioblastoma patients : Better treatment delivery, less toxicity, and fewer disease complications.""","""Objectives: Marital status is a well-described prognostic factor in patients with gliomas but the observed survival difference is unexplained in the available population-based studies. Methods: A series of 57 elderly glioblastoma patients (≥70 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Patients received radiotherapy or chemoradiation with temozolomide. The prognostic significance of marital status was assessed. Disease complications, toxicity, and treatment delivery were evaluated in detail. Results: Overall survival was significantly higher in married than in unmarried patients (median, 7.9 vs. 4.0 months; p = 0.006). The prognostic significance of marital status was preserved in the multivariate analysis (HR, 0.41; p = 0.011). Married patients could receive significantly higher daily temozolomide doses (mean, 53.7 mg/m² vs. 33.1 mg/m²; p = 0.020), were more likely to receive maintenance temozolomide (45.7 % vs. 11.8 %; p = 0.016), and had to be hospitalized less frequently during radiotherapy (55.0 % vs. 88.2 %; p = 0.016). Of the patients receiving temozolomide, married patients showed significantly lower rates of hematologic and liver toxicity. Most complications were infectious or neurologic in nature. Complications of any grade were more frequent in unmarried patients (58.8 % vs. 30.0 %; p = 0.041) with the incidence of grade 3-5 complications being particularly elevated (47.1 % vs. 15.0 %; p = 0.004). Conclusion: We found poorer treatment delivery as well as an unexpected severe increase in toxicity and disease complications in elderly unmarried glioblastoma patients.

"""Genetic association between mitochondrial DNA copy number and glioma risk: insights from causality.""","""Background: The genetic causal association between the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and the development of glioma and glioblastoma (GBM) remains unclear. Methods: The summary-level datasets for mtDNA-CN were obtained from participants in the UK Biobank and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium. Additionally, summary statistics datasets related to glioma were collected from a comprehensive meta-analysis genome-wide association study, which included 12,488 cases and 18,169 controls. The main method employed was inverse variance weighting, supplemented by Bonferroni correction to account for multiple tests. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed to address potential pleiotropy and strengthen the reliability of the results. Results: In the primary analysis, no genetic causal association was found between mtDNA-CN and glioma (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 0.94-1.52, P = 0.1394), nor with low-grade glioma (OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.79-1.51, P = 0.5588).

"""Cytomegalovirus infection in early childhood may be protective against glioblastoma multiforme, while later infection is a risk factor.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and most aggressive type of primary brain tumor, accounting for 52% of all primary brain tumor cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors. Recently, evidence for a viral cause has been postulated, possibly cytomegalovirus (CMV). In one report, 80% of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme had detectable cytomegalovirus DNA in their peripheral blood, while sero-positive normal donors and other surgical patients did not exhibit detectable virus. However, another study reported that five glioblastoma patients showed no circulating CMV detected either with RT-PCR or blood culture. But CMV could still be a factor in the genesis of glioblastoma multiforme, if age at infection is taken into account, since the incidence of both glioblastoma multiforme and CMV infection are inversely related to socioeconomic status. CMV infection in early childhood, more common in lower socioeconomic groups, may be protective against glioblastoma multiforme, whereas CMV infection in later childhood or adulthood may be a risk factor for glioblastoma. If so, glioblastoma multiforme occurrence would resemble paralytic polio, where low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene and early infection are protective.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22385772

"""Correlation among pathology, genotype, and patient outcomes in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are histologically and genetically heterogeneous. We have investigated to what extent histologic features reflect the genetic profile and whether they are predictive of clinical outcome. Key histologic characteristics, including major cell types (small cell, nonsmall cell), other components such as oligodendroglial components, gemistocytes, multinucleated giant cells, as well as necrosis and microvascular proliferation, of 420 cases of glioblastoma within a population-based study (1) were reassessed and correlated with patients' clinical outcome and key genetic alterations. EGFR amplification and p16 homozygous deletion were significantly more frequent in small cell glioblastomas than in nonsmall cell glioblastomas (EGFR, 46% vs 26%, p = 0.0002; p16 39% vs 25%, p = 0.0167). Multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender showed that small cell glioblastomas had frequent EGFR amplification and p16 deletion but infrequent PTEN mutations. An oligodendroglial component was detected in 20% of glioblastomas; these patients were significantly younger (54.4 +/- 13.6 vs 59.2 +/- 13.8 years; p = 0.0049) and survived longer (10.3 +/- 8.3 vs 8.2 +/- 8.4 months; p = 0.0647). However, multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender did not show the presence of an oligodendroglial component to be predictive of longer survival. After adjustment for age and gender, LOH 1p was associated with longer survival (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.0), whereas LOH 10q was associated with shorter survival (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8) of patients with glioblastoma.

Vascular proliferation was observed in all glioblastomas, whereas large ischemic and/or pseudopalisading necrosis was observed in 366 of 420 (87%) cases.

Multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender confirmed this observation (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0). Multivariate analysis with adjustment for age and gender showed that necrosis was significantly associated with wild-type TP53 and absence of an oligodendroglial component.

Radiomics features were extracted from multiple regions of multiparameter MRI. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to verify the ability of the imaging signature to predict the response of GBM patients to radiotherapy before an operation. Multivariate Cox regression including radiomics signature and preoperative clinical risk factors was used to further improve the ability to predict the overall survival (OS) of individual GBM patients, which was presented in the form of a nomogram. Results: The radiomics signature was built by eight selected features. The C-index of the radiomics signature in the TCIA and independent test cohorts was 0.703 (P < 0.001) and 0.757 (P = 0.001), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that the radiomics signature (HR: 0.290, P < 0.001), age (HR: 1.023, P = 0.01), and KPS (HR: 0.968, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for OS in GBM patients before surgery. When the radiomics signature and preoperative clinical risk factors were combined, the radiomics nomogram further improved the performance of OS prediction in individual patients (C-index = 0.764 and 0.758 in the TCIA and test cohorts, respectively).

"""[Epidemiological features of brain tumors].""","""Brain tumors account for 1.4% of all cancers and 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths.

In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear.

All patients in this study underwent intracranial surgery for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Patients and methods: We performed a single center retrospective study of a cohort of 153 patients who underwent surgery for GBM aided by intraoperative MRI from October of 2009 to January of 2015 at the International Neuroscience Institute (INI), Hannover, Germany. Out of all patients, 75 in comparison to 78 were operated with and without the additional use of IPC, respectively. Both groups received graduated compression stockings, LMWH and physiotherapy postoperatively as a basic thromboprophylaxis. Postoperatively the patients were screened for DVT by Doppler ultrasonography of the limbs and pulmonary embolism (PE) by CT-scan of the chest. Results: DVTs were found in 6 patients with IPC and in 3 patients without IPC. The incidence of developing DVTs was therefore not significantly increased with the application of IPC from 3.9% to 8% (P-value: 0.33). No statistically significant differences were found in the probability of occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) with a reduction from 2.6% to 1.3% (P-value: 0.59). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate, that the surgical intervention and the subsequent patient immobilization, as well as the thromboprophylactic techniques used have a relatively low influence on the occurrence of thromboembolic complications than we expected. Our findings might be attributed to the overall low number of these complications in a glioblastoma multiforme patient population expected to be at a high risk for coagulopathy. In other words, in order to produce statistically significant results, we would need to increase the patient cohort. By doing so we may better detect a positive therapeutic effect. Alternatively, because of the multitude of possible complex risk-factors leading to coagulopathy in a glioblastoma patient population it might be the case that IPC has little or no effect and that there is a different underlying mechanism responsible for the observed coagulopathy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29859696

Methods: In all, 26 patients with supratentorial single lesion glioblastoma underwent tumor resection and intracerebral injection of murine retroviral vector-producer cells for gene therapy with the herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase gene/ganciclovir system. Serial contrast-enhanced MR studies were obtained before treatment and postoperatively on day 1 or 2; weeks 2, 4, 9, 13, 17, 25, and 33; and every 8 weeks thereafter. Iodomethyltyrosine single-photon emission CT (IMT-SPECT) investigations also were performed in selected cases. Results: Twelve patients showed nontumorous enhancement of various intensities after treatment, arising within 18 to 72 hours and persisting at 3 to 10 months. It was characterized by a strong local enhancement up to 20 mm thick, which was initially nodular and later linear along the resection cavity wall and surrounded by massive perifocal edema. This 'flare' enhancement had features that clearly differed from those of residual tumor enhancements and benign postsurgical enhancements. The IMT-SPECT investigations showed increased amino acid uptake in patients with enhancement from residual or relapsing tumor, but not in patients with flare. Conclusion: After local gene therapy, a unique dynamic, transient perifocal flare enhancement can occur on MR images.

"""Strong adverse prognostic impact of hyperglycemic episodes during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: In comparison to normal brain tissue, glioblastomas exhibit significantly increased glucose uptake. Brain edema is a common complication during adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, leading to a requirement for glucocorticoid treatment. Glucocorticoid treatment frequently causes considerable deregulation of blood glucose levels. Therefore, episodes of hyperglycemia may contribute to radio- and/or chemoresistance. Patients and methods: This study comprises a retrospective analysis of the influence of hyperglycemic episodes (HEs) during adjuvant therapy on the overall survival of 106 glioblastoma multiforme patients. Results: The occurrence of one or more deregulated blood glucose value(s) > 10 mM is associated with a reduction in median overall survival from 16.7 to 8.8 months. A significantly poorer overall survival of patients with hyperglycemia could also be detected in subgroup analyses of patients with complete tumor resection and complete treatment according to the EORTC 22891/26891 trial protocol, as well as in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. A history of diabetes mellitus had no influence on prognosis. Discussion: Our data suggest that the observed negative impact of elevated blood glucose levels on overall survival may not solely be explained by the patients' poorer general condition; the elevated blood glucose concentration itself may play a pathogenetic role. This could be due to increased activity of antioxidant systems, elevated expression of DNA damage response proteins and protection of hypoxic tumor cells against apoptosis combined with hypoxia-mediated radioresistance. Conclusion: A possible prognostic impact of elevated blood glucose levels during the period of adjuvant (chemo-) radiotherapy of glioblastoma should be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24938515

Results: Twenty-eight showed apparent 1p/19q codeletion by either FISH and/or PCR-based LOH, but only 1/26 showed codeletion by both tests. Over 90% of tumours with apparent codeletion by either FISH or LOH also had 10q LOH and/or EGFR amplification, features inversely related to true whole-arm 1p/19q codeletion.

Isolated losses of 1p or 19q also had no impact on survival. Conclusions: These data suggest that (i) 1p/19q testing is not useful on gliomas that are histologically GBMs; (ii) codeletion testing should be reserved only for cases with compatible morphology; and (iii) EGFR, 10q, and IDH1 testing can help act as safeguards against a false-positive 1p/19q result.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23363074

The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of DM2, hyperglycemia and metformin on OS of patients with GBM. In addition, we evaluated the effect of these factors on the risk of development of GBM. This review supports accumulating evidence that hyperglycemia, rather than DM2, and elevated BMI are independent risk factors for poor outcome and shorter OS in patients with GBM.

Flow cytometry analysis showed that JUB silencing blocked cell cycle at S and G2/M phases, and induced apoptosis, which could contribute to cell growth suppression. Furthermore, knockdown of JUB caused downregulation of CDK6 and activations of Caspase 3 and PARP. Conclusions: The results in this study uncovered that JUB was a regulator involved in proliferation of glioma cells, and it could be used as a potential therapeutic target for glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26406867

"""Effect of Piezo1 Overexpression on Peritumoral Brain Edema in Glioblastomas.""","""Background and purpose: Previous studies have suggested that increased mortality and disability in patients with brain tumor are associated with peritumoral brain edema. However, the mechanism of peritumoral brain edema in brain tumors is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Piezo1 overexpression on peritumoral brain edema in glioblastomas. Materials and methods: The Piezo1 expression in cell lines and paired samples was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Sixty-four patients with glioblastomas were analyzed retrospectively. The Piezo1 expression of tumor tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. The diameters of tumor and edema were measured by preoperative MR imaging, and the edema index value was calculated. Results: Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that Piezo1 expression was higher in 6 glioma cell lines than in the normal astrocyte cell line. Compared with peritumoral tissues, Piezo1 was up-regulated in tumor tissues. Sixty-four patients with glioblastomas were enrolled in further study. Piezo1 was higher in the moderate edema group than in the mild edema group (P < .001), higher in the severe edema group than in the moderate edema group (P < .001), and correlated with the edema index (r = 0.73; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the edema index yielded an area under the curve of 0.867 (95% CI, 0.76-0.97; P < .001), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 70%. Conclusions: Piezo1 overexpression is positively correlated with the degree of peritumoral brain edema in glioblastomas. Predicting high Piezo1 expression in tumor tissues based on the edema extent shows good sensitivity and specificity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675337
"""Molecular pathological epidemiology gives clues to paradoxical findings.""","""A number of epidemiologic studies have described what appear to be paradoxical associations, where an incongruous relationship is observed between a certain well-established risk factor for disease incidence and favorable clinical outcome among patients with that disease. For example, the 'obesity paradox' represents the association between obesity and better survival among patients with a certain disease such as coronary heart disease. Paradoxical observations cause vexing clinical and public health problems as they raise questions on causal relationships and hinder the development of effective interventions. Compelling evidence indicates that pathogenic processes encompass molecular alterations within cells and the microenvironment, influenced by various exogenous and endogenous exposures, and that interpersonal heterogeneity in molecular pathology and pathophysiology exists among patients with any given disease. In this article, we introduce methods of the emerging integrative interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE), which is founded on the unique disease principle and disease continuum theory. We analyze and decipher apparent paradoxical findings, utilizing the MPE approach and available literature data on tumor somatic genetic and epigenetic characteristics. Through our analyses in colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma (malignant brain tumor), we can readily explain paradoxical associations between disease risk factors and better prognosis among disease patients. The MPE paradigm and approach can be applied to not only neoplasms but also various non-neoplastic diseases where there exists indisputable ubiquitous heterogeneity of pathogenesis and molecular pathology. The MPE paradigm including consideration of disease heterogeneity plays an essential role in advancements of precision medicine and public health.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445996

Currently, the literature on mediation analyses with survival outcomes largely focused on settings with a single mediator and quantified the mediation effects on the hazard, log hazard and log survival time (Lange and Hansen 2011; VanderWeele 2011). In this article, we propose a multi-mediator model for survival data by employing a flexible semiparametric probit model. We characterize path-specific effects (PSEs) of the exposure on the outcome mediated through specific mediators. We derive closed form expressions for PSEs on a transformed survival time and the survival probabilities. Statistical inference on the PSEs is developed using a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator under the semiparametric probit model and the functional Delta method. Results from simulation studies suggest that our proposed methods perform well in finite sample.

Treatment failures include radiation-induced glioblastomas (RIG), which are often diagnosed solely on imaging. Recent studies suggest that RIGs differ from spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), based on microarray gene-expression profiling. Retrospective review of children with average-risk medulloblastoma treated from 1996 to 2003 included 16 patients with 5 treatment failures. One died of disease progression, 1 died as a result of radiation necrosis, and 3 children died of pathology-confirmed GBM. Of these 3 GBMs, one was studied with electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and gene-expression microarray analysis. This tumor had focal medulloblastoma and similarity by gene-expression microarray with other RIGs. With both components in the recurrent tumor, we suggest it was in the process of transitioning from medulloblastoma to RIG, that is, 'catching the tumor in the act.' Some radiation-induced nervous system tumors may develop as a direct result of severe oncologic changes within the original tumor cells, with the tumor evolving into a different phenotypic tumor type.

Its high intratumor heterogeneity contributes to therapeutic resistance, tumor progression and recurrence. We sequenced 31 loci in 11 patients with glioblastoma (including one patient with samples available from the primary and recurrent tumors) to determine the genetic basis and intratumor heterogeneity of glioblastoma. By analyzing the somatic mutations, known driver genes were identified, including EGFR, PTEN and TP53, and the MUC16 gene exhibited the highest mutation rate in the samples examined. Through an evolutionary analysis of the sequencing results, the EGFR p.L861Q mutation was determined to play a role in the progression from the primary tumor to a relapsing tumor in one patient. We analyzed 1403 genes in blood-derived ctDNA that were previously revealed to play a role in tumorigenesis and the progression of cancer. Somatic mutations identified through ctDNA sequencing that match the results of multipoint exon sequencing in tumor tissues were detected, such as EGFR p.L861Q.

The combination of Adp53, at low multiplicity in order to mimic the low in vivo efficiency of virus-mediated gene delivery, with X-ray irradiation resulted in a marked decrease of glioblastoms cell survival.

The expression level of 15 genes was more than two-fold higher in the first group of glioblastoma (80 samples) in comparison with the second group (144 samples) and 401 genes and--more than two-fold lower as compared to the second group. 10 of 15 genes, which expression level prevailed in the first group, encode the proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation. A significant percentage of 401 genes are the genes that encode proteins involved in the functioning of neural cells and participating in the processes such as synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, the formation of myelin sheath, axon formation. Kohonen map, built on the basis of the data of 15 genes with prevailed expression in the first group and 60 (of4 01) genes, whose expression level elevated in the second group, confirmed the existence of two glioblastoma groups with specific gene expression profiles. Distribution of the glioblastomas into two groups may reflect two pathways of astrocytic glioma development, one of which leads to the formation of tumors with higher levels of gene expression, which protein products are involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation.

"""Incidence and prognostic significance of non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality in glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: The presence of non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality is useful for differentiating between glioblastoma and metastatic disease, but its significance has not been studied. We aimed to determine the incidence and prognostic implications of non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality in glioblastomas. Methods: Patients with a new diagnosis of glioblastoma between September 2007 and December 2010 were identified. Only patients with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences were included. Pre-operative MRIs were reviewed together by two readers to determine whether there was evidence of non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality, based primarily on the FLAIR sequence. The results were compared with patient survival using both univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: One hundred fifty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-seven patients (51%) had evidence of non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality. On both univariate and multivariate analysis, there was overall no significant difference in survival between patients with non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality and those without. Peripheral enhancing lesions (51 patients) were generally associated with the longest survival, but subgroup analysis suggested that non-enhancing signal abnormality was associated with worse survival in these patients (P = 0.004), conveying an intermediate prognosis. Conclusions: Non-enhancing cortical signal abnormality is a common feature of glioblastomas, occurring in about half of cases. It does not affect survival overall, but appears to be associated with worse survival in the setting of a peripherally located enhancing lesion. This has the potential to alter surgical management.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26597591
"""Integration of global spectral karyotyping, CGH arrays, and expression arrays reveals important genes in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system in adults. Patients with GBM have few treatment options, and their disease is invariably fatal. Molecularly targeted agents offer the potential to improve patient treatment; however, the use of these will require a fuller understanding of the genetic changes in this complex tumor. Methods: We analyzed a series of 32 patients with GBM with array comparative genomic hybridization in combination with gene expression analysis. We focused on the recurrent breakpoints found by spectral karyotyping (SKY). Results: By SKY we identified 23 recurrent breakpoints of the 202 translocations found in GBM cases. Gains and losses were identified in chromosomal regions close to the breakpoints by array comparative genomic hybridization. We evaluated the genes located in the regions involved in the breakpoints in depth. A list of 406 genes that showed a level of expression significantly different between patients and control subjects was selected to determine their effect on survival. Genes CACNA2D3, PPP2R2B, SIK, MAST3, PROM1, and PPP6C were significantly associated with shorter survival (median 200 days vs. 450 days, P≤0.03).

We investigated 80 primary untreated GBM using both G-banding analysis and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH). Abnormal karyotypes were found in 83% of the tumors. The most common numerical chromosome aberrations were +7, -10, -13, -14, -15, +20, and -22. Structural abnormalities most commonly involved chromosomes 1 and 3, and the short arm of chromosome 9. HR-CGH verified these findings and revealed additional frequent losses at 1p34-36, 6q22-27, and 19q12-13 and gains of 3q26 and 12q13-15. Although most karyotypes and gain/loss patterns were complex, there was also a distinct subset of tumors displaying simple karyotypic changes only. There was a statistically significant association between trisomy 7 and monosomy 10, and also between +7/-10 as putative primary aberrations and secondary losses of 1p, 9p, 13q, and 22q. The low number of tumors in the rarer histological tumor subgroups precludes definite conclusions, but there did not seem to be any clear-cut cytogenetic-pathological correlations, perhaps with the exception of ring chromosomes in giant cell glioblastomas.

"""Determining a cut-off residual tumor volume threshold for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy: A multicenter cohort study.""","""Standard-of-care treatment of glioblastomas involves maximal safe resection and adjuvant temozolomide chemo-radiotherapy. Although extent of resection (EOR) is a well-known surgical predictor for overall survival most lesions cannot be completely resected. We hypothesize that in the event of incomplete resection, residual tumor volume (RTV) may be a more significant predictor than EOR. This was a multicenter retrospective review of 147 adult glioblastoma patients (mean age 53 years) that underwent standard treatment. Semiautomatic magnetic resonance imaging segmentation was performed for pre- and postoperative scans for volumetric analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for prognostic factors including: age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, EOR and RTV. EOR and RTV cut-off values for improved OS were determined and internally validated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for 12-month overall survival. Half of the tumors had MGMT promoter methylation (77, 52%). The median tumor volume, EOR and RTV were 43.20 cc, 93.5%, and 3.80 cc respectively. Gross total resection was achieved in 52 patients (35%). Cox proportional hazards regression, ROC and maximum Youden index analyses for RTV and EOR showed that a cut-off value of <3.50 cc (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48-0.98) and ≥84% (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.96) respectively conferred an overall survival advantage. Independent overall survival predictors were MGMT promoter methylation (adjusted HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.55) and a RTV of <3.50 cc (adjusted HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.95), but not EOR for incompletely resected glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712777
"""Failure pattern following complete resection plus radiotherapy and temozolomide is at the resection margin in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are highly motile cancers that invade through normal brain. In the absence of curative chemotherapy this invasion, beyond surgical and radiotherapy margins, to distant brain sites is thought to be an important cause of treatment failure. Paradoxically, studies analyzing failure patterns have consistently shown that the large majority of failures occur at the original tumor site. This conflict may be explained by the fact these cancers are often only sub-totally resected and radiotherapy and chemotherapies fail to control this significant local cancer burden. We analyzed the failure pattern in 20 consecutive patients with complete resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portion of GBM demonstrated on the immediate post-operative magnetic resonance study, and who underwent a radical course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We found that recurrences occurred only at the resection margin in 17 of 20 patients. Recurrences were exclusively distant in 2 of 20 patients and occurred at both the resection margin and a distant site in 1 of 20 cases.

"""The critical role of ERK in death resistance and invasiveness of hypoxia-selected glioblastoma cells.""","""Background: The rapid growth of tumor parenchyma leads to chronic hypoxia that can result in the selection of cancer cells with a more aggressive behavior and death-resistant potential to survive and proliferate. Thus, identifying the key molecules and molecular mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic changes associated with chronic hypoxia has valuable implications for the development of a therapeutic modality. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular basis of the phenotypic changes triggered by chronic repeated hypoxia. Methods: Hypoxia-resistant T98G (HRT98G) cells were selected by repeated exposure to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Cell death rate was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method and protein expression levels were examined by western blot analysis. The invasive phenotype of the tumor cells was determined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of proteins in the brain tumor samples. The Student T-test and Pearson Chi-Square test was used for statistical analyses. Results: We demonstrate that chronic repeated hypoxic exposures cause T98G cells to survive low oxygen tension. As compared with parent cells, hypoxia-selected T98G cells not only express higher levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and phosphorylated ERK, but they also have a more invasive potential in Matrigel invasion chambers. Activation or suppression of ERK pathways with a specific activator or inhibitor, respectively, indicates that ERK is a key molecule responsible for death resistance under hypoxic conditions and a more invasive phenotype. Finally, we show that the activation of ERK is more prominent in malignant glioblastomas exposed to hypoxia than in low grade astrocytic glial tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggests that activation of ERK plays a pivotal role in death resistance under chronic hypoxia and phenotypic changes related to the invasive phenotype of HRT98G cells compared to parent cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161638

Therefore, numerous studies have focused on the molecular biology of glioblastoma and its linkage to clinical behavior. Here we investigated 70 glioblastomas using the array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) with GenoSensor Array 300 to identify recurrent DNA copy number imbalances associated with patient outcomes. Univariate log-rank analysis of array-CGH data revealed 46 copy number aberrations (CNAs) associated with outcome. Among them, 26 CNAs were associated with shortened survival whereas the remaining 20 CNAs correlated with good prognosis. A hierarchical cluster analysis disclosed two genetically distinct groups of glioblastomas (1 and 2; 56 and 14 tumors, respectively). Univariate log-rank test discerned significant difference in survival between both genetic subsets while the 5-year survival rate consisted of 0 for group 1 and 63% for group 2. Multivariate analysis revealed that unfavorable genetic signature is an independent prognostic factor increasing a risk of patient death (hazard ratio, 4.38; P=0.00001). In conclusion, our current study suggests that glioblastomas can be subdivided into clinically relevant genetic subsets.

We show that tTG significantly enhances the signaling activity and lifespan of EGF receptors (EGFRs) in these brain cancer cells. Moreover, overexpressing tTG in T98G glioblastoma cells that normally express low levels of tTG caused a marked upregulation of EGFR expression and transforming activity. Furthermore, we show that tTG accentuates EGFR signaling by blocking c-Cbl-catalyzed EGFR ubiquitylation through the ability of tTG to bind GTP and adopt a specific conformation that enables it to interact with c-Cbl. These findings demonstrate that tTG contributes to gliomagenesis by interfering with EGFR downregulation and, thereby, promoting transformation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23770238

Next generation sequencing and genotyping approaches were applied to assess genetic risk factors in the haemostatic system. Clinical data including surgery, reoperation as well as blood group and patient information such as age and gender were available from patient records. Logistic regression analysis was performed to asses VTE risk. Results: In the study 47 patients (34%) were diagnosed for VTE during the course of their disease. When genetic and non-genetic potential risk factors were evaluated, only B blood group was found to be significantly associated with VTE incidence (odds ratio [OR] = 6.91; confidence interval [CI] = 2.19-24.14; P = 0.001).

Frontal lobe tumor location also seemed to slightly increase VTE risk compared to other brain sites (OR = 3.14; CI = 1.1-10.7) although the significance level was at borderline (P = 0.05). Current study identified B blood group as the component in non-O blood groups that is responsible for increased VTE risk.

Following incubation, colonies were counted to determine percent survival. All six cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to Taxol (LD50 1 nM to > 250 nM). However, even at concentrations exceeding those achievable clinically, all cell lines had surviving cells, indicating a saturation threshold for Taxol cytotoxicity. Cell locomotion was evaluated using the radial dish assay to determine the rate of egress of cells from a region of high cell density to the periphery. Increasing Taxol concentration caused increased locomotion in all six cell lines (p < 0.0001). Although Taxol has significant cytocidal impact, it increases in vitro locomotion of glioblastoma cells.

In order to pinpoint the genes expressed differentially in the intracranial primary tumor and the metastatic tumors, we used cDNA microarray. The patterns of gene expression in these 2 samples were highly similar, suggesting that the mechanism of metastasis was direct infiltration of tumor cells into extracranial blood vessels. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 was overexpressed in both primary and metastatic tumors. Immunohistochemical studies of DNA-dependent protein kinase, which participates in the repair of DNA, was strongly positive in the samples obtained at the first and second operations, but the positive rates were markedly reduced in the specimens obtained at the third and fourth operations.

The mechanistic consequences of this mutation have not yet been fully clarified, with conflicting opinions existing in the literature; however, IDH-1 mutation may be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish between primary and secondary glioblastoma multiforme (sGBM) from malignant progression of a lower grade glioma. We develop a mathematical model of IDH-1 mutated secondary glioblastoma using evolutionary game theory to investigate the interactions between four different phenotypic populations within the tumor: autonomous growth, invasive, glycolytic, and the hybrid invasive/glycolytic cells. Our model recapitulates glioblastoma behavior well and is able to reproduce two recent experimental findings, as well as make novel predictions concerning the rate of invasive growth as a function of vascularity, and fluctuations in the proportions of phenotypic populations that a glioblastoma will experience under different microenvironmental constraints.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21301070
"""Suppression of the tissue factor-dependent coagulation cascade: a contributing factor for the development of intratumoral hemorrhage in glioblastoma.""","""To clarify factors that may contribute to the development of intratumoral hemorrhage, we analyzed the expression of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in glioblastomas with or without massive intratumoral hematoma. Among 196 glioma cases reviewed, there were 13 with macroscopic intratumoral hemorrhage. We focused on the glioblastomas and used immunoblot- and immunohistochemical methods to compare the expression of TF and TFPI in 9 glioblastomas with macroscopic hematoma and 30 glioblastomas without macroscopic hemorrhage. Although TF was expressed in most glioblastomas irrespective of the presence or absence of macroscopic hemorrhage, the staining patterns differed significantly: TF-positive glioma cells were diffusely present in the non-hemorrhage group; in the group with hemorrhage, positive cells, primarily macrophages, were scattered throughout the tissue examined. The expression of TFPI was significantly higher in the group with than in the group without hemorrhage. Our results suggest that local suppression of the TF-dependent coagulation cascade is a contributing factor that permits the occurrence of intratumoral hemorrhage.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10934288
"""A functional screen identifies miRs that induce radioresistance in glioblastomas.""","""The efficacy of radiotherapy in many tumor types is limited by normal tissue toxicity and by intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular network responsible for regulating radiosensitivity/resistance. Here, an unbiased functional screen identified four microRNAs (miR1, miR125a, miR150, and miR425) that induce radioresistance. Considering the clinical importance of radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma, the impact of these miRNAs on glioblastoma radioresistance was investigated. Overexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with TGFβ signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGFβ and antagonized by a TGFβ receptor inhibitor. Together, these results identify and characterize a new role for miR425, miR1, miR125, and miR150 in promoting radioresistance in glioblastomas and provide insight into the therapeutic application of TGFβ inhibitors in radiotherapy. Implications: Systematic identification of miRs that cause radioresistance in gliomas is important for uncovering predictive markers for radiotherapy or targets for overcoming radioresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256711
"""Postoperative resveratrol administration improves prognosis of rat orthotopic glioblastomas.""","""Background: Although our previous study revealed lumbar punctured resveratrol could remarkably prolong the survival of rats bearing orthotopic glioblastomas, it also suggested the administration did not completely suppress rapid tumour growth. These evidences led us to consider that the prognosis of tumour-bearing rats may be further improved if this treatment is used in combination with neurosurgery. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the combined treatment on rat orthotopic glioblastomas. Methods: Rat RG2 glioblastoma cells were inoculated into the brains of 36 rats. The rats were subjected to partial tumour removal after they showed symptoms of intracranial hypertension. There were 28 rats that survived the surgery, and these animals were randomly and equally divided into the control group without postoperative treatment and the LP group treated with 100 μl of 300 μM resveratrol via the LP route. Resveratrol was administered 24 h after tumour resection in 3-day intervals, and the animals received 7 treatments. The intracranial tumour sizes, average life span, cell apoptosis and STAT3 signalling were evaluated by multiple experimental approaches in the tumour tissues harvested from both groups. Results: The results showed that 5 of the 14 (35.7%) rats in the LP group remained alive over 60 days without any sign of recurrence. The remaining nine animals had a longer mean postoperative survival time (11.0 ± 2.9 days) than that of the (7.3 + 1.3 days; p < 0.05) control group. The resveratrol-treated tumour tissues showed less Ki67 labelling, widely distributed apoptotic regions, upregulated PIAS3 expression and reduced p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that postoperative resveratrol administration efficiently improves the prognosis of rat advanced orthotopic glioblastoma via inhibition of growth, induction of apoptosis and inactivation of STAT3 signalling. Therefore, this therapeutic approach could be of potential practical value in the management of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30176837

The results of the present study may provide potential therapeutic targets that are involved in the development of glioblastoma. The GSE4290 raw data set was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and consisted of 23 non‑tumor samples and 77 glioblastoma (grade 4) tumor samples. Robust Multichip Averaging was used to identify DEGs between the glioblastoma and non‑tumor samples. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs was also performed. Based on the TRANSFAC® database, TFs associated with the glioblastoma gene expression profile were used to construct a regulatory network. Furthermore, trimmed subnets were identified according to calculated Z‑scores. A total of 676 DEGs were identified, of which 190 were upregulated and 496 were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that the majority of these DEGs were functionally enriched in synaptic transmission, regulation of vesicle‑mediated transport and ion‑gated channel activity. In addition, the enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway included neuroactive ligand‑receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle. Based on the TRANSFAC® database, transcriptional regulatory networks with 2,246 nodes and 4,515 regulatory pairs were constructed. According to the Z‑scores, the following candidate TFs were identified: TP53, SP1, JUN, STAT3 and SPI1; alongside their downstream DEGs. TP53 was the only differentially expressed TF. These candidate TFs and their downstream DEGs may have important roles in the progression of glioblastoma, and could be potential biomarkers for clinical treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25514975
"""The expression level of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 is related to MIB-1 labeling index and predicts survival of glioblastoma patients.""","""Although there are many reports on the clinical use of the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), which is a measure of proliferative activity in astrocytomas; its significance varies between studies. There are no known molecules that are directly linked to the MIB-1 LI in astrocytomas. We evaluated the clinical value of the MIB-1 LI in our human glioblastoma cases and determined the molecules that possibly influenced the MIB-1 LI. An immunohistochemical study of the MIB-1 protein was performed and MIB-1 LIs of 38 glioblastomas were determined. In the same cases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P(1)), which are known regulators of glioma cell proliferation, were detected and quantified by quantitative real-time-PCR or western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 38 patients with glioblastomas showed that a high MIB-1 LI correlated with poor survival (P < 0.05). Among the molecules tested, only the low expression of S1P(1) was significantly correlated with the high MIB-1 LI in glioblastomas (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the S1P(1) expression level was a significant prognostic factor. Our results indicate that the MIB-1 LI is an important prognostic factor in human glioblastomas. Furthermore, downregulation of S1P(1) expression increases proliferative activity, and thus enhances the malignancy of glioblastomas, resulting in a poor survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19937366

MGMT promoter methylation has been associated with TP53 G: C to A:T transition mutations in various types of cancers, and with poor prognosis in patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Mutations of TP53 are more frequent in secondary than in primary glioblastoma, thus the expected MGMT promoter methylation was low in primary glioblastoma. Glioblastoma patients with MGMT promoter methylation showed better response to chemotherapy based on alkylating agents and longer survival than patients without MGMT methylation. We examined 32 primary glioblastomas, treated with radiotherapy and surgery, for TP53 mutation by direct sequencing and MGMT promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutations were detected in 72% and 31% of primary glioblastoma, respectively. Although not statistically significant, the frequency of TP53 G:C to A:T mutations were higher in cases with (26%) than without (11%) MGMT promoter methylation (p=0.376). MGMT promoter methylation had no impact on patient survival. Our data indicate that MGMT promoter methylation occurs frequently in primary glioblastoma, but does not lead to G:C to A:T TP53 mutations, has no independent prognostic value and is not a predictive marker unless glioblastoma patients are treated with chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19100509

"""Glioblastoma multiforme in two non-nuclear family members.""","""Background: In spite of traditional and current epidemiological research, there have been few environmental risk factors identified for malignant brain tumors. It has been an equally difficult challenge to identify genetic causes for brain tumors because of the rarity of families with multiple affected individuals, which prevents the use of traditional methods of genetic analysis such as genetic linkage, sib-pair, or even population-based association studies. Thus, it is important to take advantage of rare occasions of familial brain tumors. Methods: Identification and careful study of such families may provide important clues about the etiology of brain malignancies. We studied one family of which two nonnuclear family members were affected with pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were used on archival sections from each patient's tumor to investigate the loss and/or gain of important allelic endpoints. Tissue sections were prepared and processed for FISH. DNA probes for targeted gene loci were used to assess allelic gain/loss. FISH probes targeted regions including 19q13, 1p36, 10q/phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN), chromosome 3, chromosome 7, chromosome 17/17q and p53/17p. Results: FISH analyses identified distinct abnormalities in the two patients, suggesting that despite the familial connections and histologically similar tumors, genetic abnormalities are abundant and heterogeneous among these malignancies.

In the current study, the overarching goal is to demonstrate that primary (glioblastomas) and secondary (brain metastases) malignancies can be differentiated based on the microstructure of the peritumoral region. This is achieved by exploiting the extracellular water differences between vasogenic edema and infiltrative tissue and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-derived free water volume fraction. We obtained 85% accuracy in discriminating extracellular water differences between local patches in the peritumoral area of 66 glioblastomas and 40 metastatic patients in a cross-validation setting. On an independent test cohort consisting of 20 glioblastomas and 10 metastases, we got 93% accuracy in discriminating metastases from glioblastomas using majority voting on patches. This level of accuracy surpasses CNNs trained on other conventional DTI-based measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), that have been used in other studies. Additionally, the CNN captures the peritumoral heterogeneity better than conventional texture features, including Gabor and radiomic features. Our results demonstrate that the extracellular water content of the peritumoral tissue, as captured by the free water volume fraction, is best able to characterize the differences between infiltrative and vasogenic peritumoral regions, paving the way for its use in classifying and benchmarking peritumoral tissue with varying degrees of infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34262079

"""Macrophage migration inhibitory factor downregulation: a novel mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.""","""Anti-angiogenic therapies for cancer such as VEGF neutralizing antibody bevacizumab have limited durability. While mechanisms of resistance remain undefined, it is likely that acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy will involve alterations of the tumor microenvironment. We confirmed increased tumor-associated macrophages in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastoma patient specimens and two novel glioblastoma xenograft models of bevacizumab resistance. Microarray analysis suggested downregulated macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to be the most pertinent mediator of increased macrophages. Bevacizumab-resistant patient glioblastomas and both novel xenograft models of resistance had less MIF than bevacizumab-naive tumors, and harbored more M2/protumoral macrophages that specifically localized to the tumor edge. Xenografts expressing MIF-shRNA grew more rapidly with greater angiogenesis and had macrophages localizing to the tumor edge which were more prevalent and proliferative, and displayed M2 polarization, whereas bevacizumab-resistant xenografts transduced to upregulate MIF exhibited the opposite changes. Bone marrow-derived macrophage were polarized to an M2 phenotype in the presence of condition-media derived from bevacizumab-resistant xenograft-derived cells, while recombinant MIF drove M1 polarization. Media from macrophages exposed to bevacizumab-resistant tumor cell conditioned media increased glioma cell proliferation compared with media from macrophages exposed to bevacizumab-responsive tumor cell media, suggesting that macrophage polarization in bevacizumab-resistant xenografts is the source of their aggressive biology and results from a secreted factor. Two mechanisms of bevacizumab-induced MIF reduction were identified: (1) bevacizumab bound MIF and blocked MIF-induced M1 polarization of macrophages; and (2) VEGF increased glioma MIF production in a VEGFR2-dependent manner, suggesting that bevacizumab-induced VEGF depletion would downregulate MIF. Site-directed biopsies revealed enriched MIF and VEGF at the enhancing edge in bevacizumab-naive patients. This MIF enrichment was lost in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas, driving a tumor edge M1-to-M2 transition. Thus, bevacizumab resistance is driven by reduced MIF at the tumor edge causing proliferative expansion of M2 macrophages, which in turn promotes tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28218903

Methods: Pre-operative MR images were segmented automatically into contrast enhancing (CE) tumor volumes using Iterative Probabilistic Voxel Labeling (IPVL). Distances were calculated from the centroid of CE tumor volumes to the SVZ and correlated with gene expression profiles of the corresponding glioblastomas. Correlative analyses were performed between SVZ distance, gene expression patterns, and clinical survival. Results: Glioblastoma located in proximity to the SVZ showed increased mRNA expression patterns associated with the cancer stem-cell state, including CD133 (P = 0.006). Consistent with the previous observations suggesting that glioblastoma stem cells exhibit increased DNA repair capacity, glioblastomas in proximity to the SVZ also showed increased expression of DNA repair genes, including MGMT (P = 0.018). Reflecting this enhanced DNA repair capacity, the genomes of glioblastomas in SVZ proximity harbored fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to those located distant to the SVZ (P = 0.003). Concordant with the notion that glioblastoma stem cells are more aggressive and refractory to therapy, patients with glioblastoma in proximity to SVZ exhibited poorer progression free and overall survival (P < 0.01).

Methods: Medical records from 65 consecutive patients diagnosed with molGBM at three tertiary-care centers from our institution were retrospectively reviewed from November 2017-October 2021. Only patients who underwent reoperation for tumor recurrence and whose tissue at initial diagnosis and recurrence was available were included in this study.

Associations between these parameters and patterns of gene expression were analyzed using DAVID functional enrichment analysis. Glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) glioblastomas were poorly enhancing. Otherwise, no differences in CE parameters were found between proneural, neural, mesenchymal, and classical glioblastomas. High CEi was associated with expression of genes that mediate inflammatory responses. High CEh was associated with increased expression of genes that regulate remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and endothelial permeability. High CEr was associated with increased expression of genes that mediate cellular response to stressful metabolic states, including hypoxia and starvation.

"""Genomic expression patterns distinguish long-term from short-term glioblastoma survivors: a preliminary feasibility study.""","""We used microarray analysis to investigate associations between genotypic expression profiles and survival phenotypes in patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM). Tumor samples from 7 long-term glioblastoma survivors (>24 months) and 13 short-term survivors (<9 months) were analyzed to detect differential patterns of gene expression between these groups and to identify genotypic subclasses of glioblastomas that correlate with survival phenotypes. Five unsupervised and three supervised clustering algorithms consistently and accurately grouped the tumors into genotypic subgroups corresponding to the two clinical survival phenotypes. Three unique prospective mathematical classification algorithms were subsequently trained to use expression data to stratify unknown glioblastomas between survival groups and performed this task with 100% accuracy in validation studies. A set of 1478 genes with significant differential expression (p<0.01) between long-term and short-term survivors was identified, and additional mathematical filtering was used to isolate a 43-gene 'fingerprint' that distinguished survival phenotypes. Differential regulation of a subset of these genes was confirmed using RT-PCR. Gene ontology analysis of the fingerprint demonstrated pathophysiologic functions for the gene products that are consistent with current models of tumor biology, suggesting that differential expression of these genes may contribute etiologically to the observed differences in survival. These results demonstrate that unique expression profiles characterize genotypic subsets of primary GBMs associated with differential survival phenotypes, and these profiles can be used in a prospective fashion to assign unknown tumors to survival groups.

"""A novel path-specific effect statistic for identifying the differential specific paths in systems epidemiology.""","""Background: Biological pathways play an important role in the occurrence, development and recovery of complex diseases, such as cancers, which are multifactorial complex diseases that are generally caused by mutation of multiple genes or dysregulation of pathways. Results: We propose a path-specific effect statistic (PSE) to detect the differential specific paths under two conditions (e.g. case VS. control groups, exposure Vs. nonexposure groups). In observational studies, the path-specific effect can be obtained by separately calculating the average causal effect of each directed edge through adjusting for the parent nodes of nodes in the specific path and multiplying them under each condition. Theoretical proofs and a series of simulations are conducted to validate the path-specific effect statistic. Applications are also performed to evaluate its practical performances. A series of simulation studies show that the Type I error rates of PSE with Permutation tests are more stable at the nominal level 0.05 and can accurately detect the differential specific paths when comparing with other methods. Specifically, the power reveals an increasing trends with the enlargement of path-specific effects and its effect differences under two conditions. Besides, the power of PSE is robust to the variation of parent or child node of the nodes on specific paths. Application to real data of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), we successfully identified 14 positive specific pathways in mTOR pathway contributing to survival time of patients with GBM. All codes for automatic searching specific paths linking two continuous variables and adjusting set as well as PSE statistic can be found in supplementary materials. CONCLUSION: The proposed PSE statistic can accurately detect the differential specific pathways contributing to complex disease and thus potentially provides new insights and ways to unlock the black box of disease mechanisms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770935
"""Hypothesis test of mediation effect in causal mediation model with high-dimensional continuous mediators.""","""Causal mediation modeling has become a popular approach for studying the effect of an exposure on an outcome through a mediator. However, current methods are not applicable to the setting with a large number of mediators. We propose a testing procedure for mediation effects of high-dimensional continuous mediators. We characterize the marginal mediation effect, the multivariate component-wise mediation effects, and the L2 norm of the component-wise effects, and develop a Monte-Carlo procedure for evaluating their statistical significance. To accommodate the setting with a large number of mediators and a small sample size, we further propose a transformation model using the spectral decomposition. Under the transformation model, mediation effects can be estimated using a series of regression models with a univariate transformed mediator, and examined by our proposed testing procedure. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of our methods for continuous and dichotomous outcomes. We apply the methods to analyze genomic data investigating the effect of microRNA miR-223 on a dichotomous survival status of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We identify nine gene ontology sets with expression values that significantly mediate the effect of miR-223 on GBM survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26414245
"""The clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of multiple lesions in glioblastomas.""","""Objective: Multiple glioblastomas (GBM) are the uncommon presentation of the disease. We aimed to identify the variables associated with the survival of patients with multiple GBMs according to the updated WHO classification. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 173 patients with newly diagnosed GBM between January 2003 and December 2018 and analyzed patients with multiple lesions at the time of diagnosis. The clinical, radiographic, and biomarkers were evaluated for descriptive analysis. The median overall survival and the Kaplan-Meier curves of the multiple GBMs were estimated. Furthermore, the Cox proportional hazard regression was the estimated hazard ratio for death according to various factors. Moreover, Schoenfeld's global test was performed for estimating assumptions. Results: Of these, 30 (17.3%) of all GBMs were multiple GBMs, and multifocal and multicentric GBMs were found in 27 (90%) and 3 (10%), respectively. The median survival of the multiple GBMs was significantly shorter than solitary GBM (6 vs. 12 months, p = 0.003). Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the independent prognostic factors of multiple GBMs were concomitant Temozolomide with radiotherapy, wild-type IDH1, methylated MGMT promoter methylation in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, concomitant Temozolomide (TMZ) with radiotherapy (RT) was the strongest predictor associated with prognosis in multiple GBMs (0.40, 95%CI 0.16-0.97). Conclusions: Multiple lesions are uncommon findings in glioblastoma with poor prognostic features. Concomitant TMZ with RT was the strongest predictor of prognosis. In the future., IDH1 mutation and MGMT promoter methylation should be further explored as prognostic factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32480195
"""The Value of Immunohistochemical Methods and Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Diagnosis of IDH1 Mutant Glioblastomas.""","""Aim: To assess the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 mutation in glioblastomas using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the gold standard in the diagnosis of IDH1 mutation; by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which is available in most of the pathology laboratories; and by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, which is a non-invasive method. We also investigated the relationship between these methods and their usability in routine practice. Material and methods: RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the presence of IDH1-R132H mutation on the blocks of 70 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, and IDH1 stain was applied to the same blocks as IHC. Radiologically, preoperative magnetic resonance images of the patients were reviewed in terms of tumor size, localization, and presence of non-contrast-enhancing solid tumor component. Results: Evaluation by RT-PCR revealed that 15 (21.4%) patients were IDH-mutant, whereas IHC examination revealed 13 (18.6%) and radiological evaluation revealed 11 (15.7%) patients were IDH-mutant. There was a statistically significant difference between the IDH1 mutation detected by RT-PCR and by IHC or radiological methods (p=0.034 and p=0.000, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of IHC method in detecting IDH1 mutation were 86.6% and 100%, respectively, whereas those of radiological methods were 33.3% and 89%, respectively. Conclusion: Conclusively, radiological and IHC methods can be used in cases where RT-PCR cannot be applied for detecting IDH1 mutation. However, the results need to be confirmed by RT-PCR when necessary as these methods may sometimes overlook some IDH-mutant patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859824
"""TERT promoter mutations in primary and secondary glioblastomas.""","""Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is up-regulated in a variety of human neoplasms. Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23955565
"""Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in glioblastoma: an analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype by CISH method.""","""We examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression and EGFR gene amplification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in 109 glioblastomas, including 98 primary glioblastomas and 11 secondary glioblastomas. EGFR overexpression and EGFR gene amplification were found in 33% and 24% of glioblastoma, respectively, and all of those cases were primary glioblastoma. Large ischemic necrosis was significantly more frequent in primary glioblastomas than in secondary glioblastomas (54% vs. 18%), but pseudopalisading necrosis was not (65% vs. 54%). EGFR gene amplification was detected significantly more frequently in cases with both types of necrosis. Although glioblastomas with EGFR gene amplification invariably exhibited EGFR overexpression at the level of the whole tumor, tumor cells with EGFR gene amplification did not always show EGFR overexpression at the level of individual tumor cells. Cases of 'strong' EGFR overexpression on IHC could be regarded as having EGFR gene amplification, and cases without EGFR overexpression could not. Cases of 'weak' EGFR overexpression should be tested with CISH to confirm the presence of EGFR gene amplification. We found that 54% of glioblastomas with EGFR gene amplification were composed of areas with and without EGFR gene amplification; however, there were no obvious differences in morphology between tumor cells with and without EGFR gene amplification. Although small cell architecture might be associated with EGFR gene amplification at the level of the whole tumor, it did not always suggest amplification of the EGFR gene at the level of individual tumor cells. In one case, it seemed to suggest that a clone with EGFR gene amplification may arise in pre-existing tumor tissue and extend into the surrounding area. In cases of overall EGFR amplification, CISH would be a useful tool to decide the tumor border in areas infiltrated by tumor cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18021194
"""Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection was not correlated with overall survival in glioblastomas.""","""There were many arguments about the presence of HCMV (Human Cytomegalovirus) in malignant gliomas. This study was to investigate the presence and prognostic value of HCMV in glioblastomas. 68 patients including 64 primary glioblastomas and 4 secondary glioblastomas were involved in this study. Immunofluorescence was adopted for detecting glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein H (gH) of HCMV's in glioblastoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier Analysis and Chi Square were used to evaluate patients' survival and the association between HCMV infection and patients' characteristics respectively. We found that the presence rate of gB and gH were 48.5% (33/68) and 42.6% (29/68) in glioblastomas respectively. The co-occurrence of gB and gH was 30.8%, and the presence rates of either gB or gH in glioblastomas was 60.3%. While IDH R132H mutations were significantly correlated with a better clinical outcome (p=0.006), the presence of neither gB (p=0.551) nor gH (p=0.871) had prognostic values. Furthermore, there was no significant association between the presence of HCMV and gliomas' characteristics, neither with patients' age, gender, KPS, IDH mutations nor PTEN loss. In conclusion, our results supported the fact that HCMV was detected in glioblastomas. However, no predictive value of HCMV was observed, the treatment of glioblastomas targeting HCMV was needed to be revalued by studied again.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29788727
"""Expression of vascular permeability factor in glioblastoma specimens: correlation with tumor vascular endothelial surface and peritumoral edema.""","""Keeping in mind that the expression of vascular permeability factor (VPF) in astrocytic tumors has been related to tumor angiogenesis and peritumoral edema (PE), the aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between degree of VPF expression by tumor cells, and degree of PE and vascular endothelial surface (VES) in glioblastoma. Tumor tissue and neuroimaging data were studied in a series of 38 patients with glioblastoma. For each tumor, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies were performed in order to obtain a score of VPF expression, and a VES score, expressed as the CD-34 immunostained endothelial surface per each 1000 tumor cells. These parameters were related to the degree of PE. The results show that in glioblastomas there exist a clear correlation between the tumor-cell expression of VPF and VES, but we failed to obtain a significant correlation between degree of PE and degree of VES, or between degree of VPF expression and degree of PE. Our present results suggest that in glioblastomas, tumor angiogenesis is clearly related to the expression of VPF by tumor cells, but factors other than intratumoralpresence of VPF may contribute to the development of PE.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11131986
"""The prognostic role of IDH mutations in homogeneously treated patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.""","""The detection of IDH mutations in patients with diffusely infiltrating malignant astrocytomas resulted in substantial modifications in the concept of WHO classification of these tumors. An important underlying observation was that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) without IDH mutation had a clinical course similar to that of patients with glioblastomas (GBM). The underlying observations of the German Glioma Network and NOA-04, however, were based on mixed patient cohorts. While most GBM patients received combined radiochemotherapy, patients with AA usually had radiotherapy or chemotherapy only. This intrinsic shortcoming of the study raised the question of whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III, might have better prognosis if treated with combined radiochemotherapy than patients with GBM receiving the same combination therapy. Thus, the question remains whether the established histopathological grading criteria for malignant astrocytomas in the absence of an IDH mutation are still important if neither vascular proliferation nor necrosis are detectable. All patients in the cohort investigated here with the diagnosis of AA or GBM were subjected to a combined radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol independently of the histopathological diagnosis. Thus, the analysis of these patients allows to clarify whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III have a prognosis similar to that of GBM, IDH wildtype, WHO grade IV, even under equivalent therapeutic conditions. We determined the IDH1 and IDH2 status by sequencing, the MGMT status by pyrosequencing after bisulfite treatment and the EGFR status of the patients by FISH. In fact, the patients with the histopathological diagnosis of an AA IDH wild-type under similar aggressive therapy showed a comparable and therefore no better prognosis (median overall survival (mOS) 16 months) than patients with a GBM (mOS 13 months). Instead, patients with an AA and an IDH mutation receiving the same therapy had a mOS of 54 months. Thus, it can be concluded that in the absence of an IDH mutation, the established histopathological grading criteria 'necrosis' and 'vascular proliferation' actually lose their prognostic significance. If, on the other hand, patients with malignant astrocytomas and an IDH mutation are examined, there is still a difference between patients with necrosis and/or vascular proliferation and those whose tumors do not show such characteristics. Accordingly, in patients with malignant astrocytomas with IDH mutation it can be concluded that a histological differentiation between AA IDH mutated and GBM IDH mutated remains beneficial from a prognostic perspective.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31623667
"""Long-term survival enhanced by cordectomy in a patient with a spinal glioblastoma multiforme and paraplegia. Case report.""","""Spinal glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs) are rare lesions of the central nervous system with a prognosis as poor as that of their intracranial counterpart. The authors present a case of a 50-year-old man with a GBM of the spinal cord treated with surgical removal of the mass and cordectomy after the onset of paraplegia. Six years later, the patient developed hepatitis C and received interferon therapy. Six months after the start of interferon therapy, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right cerebellar mass pathologically consistent with a GBM. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient died 1 month later. Although intracranial dissemination of spinal GBMs has been reported, this case illustrates the longest reported interval between the occurrence of a spinal GBM and its intracranial dissemination. Thus, cordectomy should be considered as a reasonable alternative in patients with complete loss of neurological function at and below the level where they harbor a malignant spinal cord astrocytoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18074692

These tumors exhibit a high degree of vascularization, and malignant progression from astrocytoma to glioblastoma is often accompanied by increased angiogenesis and the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors. In this study, we investigated the in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) using human glioblastoma cell lines. Glioblastoma cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding BAI1 (AdBAI1), and Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively, demonstrated BAI1 mRNA and protein expression in the transduced tumor cells. Using an in vivo neovascularization assay, we found that angiogenesis surrounding AdBAI1-transduced glioblastoma cells transplanted into transparent skinfold chambers of SCID mice was significantly impaired compared to control treated cells. Additionally, in vivo inoculation with AdBAI1 of established subcutaneous or intracerebral transplanted tumors significantly impaired tumor growth and promoted increased mouse survival. Morphologically, the tumors exhibited signs of impaired angiogenesis, such as extensive necrosis and reduced intratumoral vascular density. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that BAI1 may be an excellent gene therapy candidate for the treatment of brain tumors, especially human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244591

However, familial gliomas have also been described, although less frequently, independently of these genetic syndromes showing some special features regarding its etiology and clinical manifestations. Less than 10% of gliomas may be considered as true multicentric tumours either synchronous or metachronous in clinical presentation. Metachronous glioblastomas have been associated to better prognosis in some studies, with genetic studies having found clear differences among the tumors within same patients. Familial glioblastoma with metachronous presentation is an exceptional disorder. These tumors show special therapeutic implications due to the limitations of radiotherapy once the patient has already irradiated. A variety of non-specific mutations have been found in these patients but true characterization of this disorder remains unclear and will be based on further genetic studies.

"""A REST derived gene signature stratifies glioblastomas into chemotherapy resistant and responsive disease.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common central nervous system neoplasia in adults, with 9,000 cases in the US annually. Glioblastoma multiformae, the most aggressive glioma subtype, has an 18% one-year survival rate, and 3% two year survival rate. Recent work has highlighted the role of the transcription factor RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor, REST in glioblastoma but how REST function correlates with disease outcome has not been described. Method: Using a bioinformatic approach and mining of publicly available microarray datasets, we describe an aggressive subtype of gliomas defined by a gene signature derived from REST. Using this REST gene signature we predict that REST function is enhanced in advanced glioblastoma. We compare disease outcomes between tumors based on REST status and treatment regimen, and describe downstream targets of REST that may contribute to the decreased benefits observed with high dose chemotherapy in REM tumors. Results: We present human data showing that patients with 'REST Enhanced Malignancies' (REM) tumors present with a shorter disease free survival compared to non-REM gliomas. Importantly, REM tumors are refractory to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and patients fail to respond to this line of treatment. Conclusions: This report is the first to describe a REST gene signature that predicts response to multiple rounds of chemotherapy, the mainline therapy for this disease. The REST gene signature may have important clinical implications for the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23216891
"""Identification of Hedgehog pathway responsive glioblastomas by isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation.""","""The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway regulates the growth of a subset of adult gliomas and better definition of Hh-responsive subtypes could enhance the clinical utility of monitoring and targeting this pathway in patients. Somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes occur frequently in WHO grades II and III gliomas and WHO grade IV secondary glioblastomas. Hh pathway activation in WHO grades II and III gliomas suggests that it might also be operational in glioblastomas that developed from lower-grade lesions. To evaluate this possibility and to better define the molecular and histopathological glioma subtypes that are Hh-responsive, IDH genes were sequenced in adult glioma specimens assayed for an operant Hh pathway. The proportions of grades II-IV specimens with IDH mutations correlated with the proportions that expressed elevated levels of the Hh gene target PTCH1. Indices of an operational Hh pathway were measured in all primary cultures and xenografts derived from IDH-mutant glioma specimens, including IDH-mutant glioblastomas. In contrast, the Hh pathway was not operational in glioblastomas that lacked IDH mutation or history of antecedent lower-grade disease. IDH mutation is not required for an operant pathway however, as significant Hh pathway modulation was also measured in grade III gliomas with wild-type IDH sequences. These results indicate that the Hh pathway is operational in grades II and III gliomas and glioblastomas with molecular or histopathological evidence for evolvement from lower-grade gliomas. Lastly, these findings suggest that gliomas sharing this molecularly defined route of progression arise in Hh-responsive cell types.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063752
"""The neural adhesion molecule L1CAM confers chemoresistance in human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common and malignant brain tumor. GBM tissues exhibit elevated expression of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) and the adhesion molecule L1CAM. This study investigated the mechanism of L1CAM regulation in GBM cells and its role in the mediation of chemoresistance. L1CAM expression levels varied in GBM cells being highest in A172 cells and low in T98G cells. Inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling in A172 cells reduced L1CAM expression and vice versa stimulation with exogenous TGF-β1 led to upregulation of L1CAM in T98G cells. Additionally, TGF-β1 and L1CAM expression increased during differentiation of glioma stem-like cells. L1CAM expressing GBM cells and differentiated glioma stem-like cells showed a reduced apoptotic response after treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of L1CAM in A172 cells and differentiated glioma stem-like cells increased chemosensitivity, whereas overexpression of L1CAM in T98G cells and glioma spheroids diminished the apoptotic response. Elevated L1CAM expression caused a diminished expression of caspase-8 in GBM and differentiated glioma stem-like cells. These data show that TGF-β1 dependent upregulation of L1CAM expression in GBM cells leads to the downregulation of caspase-8 and apoptosis resistance pointing to L1CAM as potential target for improved therapy of GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22948185

In addition, amplified EGFR levels indicate a bad prognosis and shorter overall survival [5].

Therefore, 24 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The pooled HR of 0.358 (95% CI 0.264-0.487, P < 0.001) indicated that IDH mutations were associated with better OS. Similarly, the pooled HR of 0.322 (95% CI 0.24200.455, P < 0.001) indicated that IDH mutations were associated with better PFS.

"""Different angiogenic phenotypes in primary and secondary glioblastomas.""","""Primary and secondary glioblastomas (pGBM, sGBM) are supposed to evolve through different genetic pathways, including EGF receptor and PDGF and its receptor and thus genes that are involved in tumor-induced angiogenesis. However, whether other angiogenic cytokines are also differentially expressed in these glioblastoma subtypes is not known so far, but this knowledge might be important to optimize an antiangiogenic therapy. Therefore, we studied the expression of several angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF-A, HGF, bFGF, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, G-CSF and GM-CSF in pGBMs and sGBMs as well as in gliomas WHO III, the precursor lesions of sGBMs. In tumor tissues, expression of all cytokines was observed albeit with marked differences concerning intensity and distribution pattern. Quantification of the cytokines in the supernatant of 30 tissue-corresponding glioma cultures revealed a predominant expression of VEGF-A in pGBMs and significantly higher expression levels of PDGF-AB in sGBMs. HGF and bFGF were determined in nearly all tumor cultures but with no GBM subtype or malignancy-related differences. Interestingly, GM-CSF and especially G-CSF were produced less frequently by tumor cells. However, GM-CSF secretion occurred together with an increased number of simultaneously secreted cytokines and correlated with a worse patient prognosis and may thus represent a more aggressive angiogenic phenotype. Finally, we confirmed an independent contribution of each tumor-derived cytokine analyzed to tumor-induced vascularization. Our data indicate that an optimal antiangiogenic therapy may require targeting of multiple angiogenic pathways that seem to differ markedly in pGBMs and sGBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16331629

DUSP6 is a critical regulator of the ERK signaling cascade and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor. We report here experimental evidences that DUSP6 is transcriptionally upregulated in primary and long-term cultures of human glioblastoma, as assayed by northern hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, producing constitutive high level of protein expression. Functional assays were performed with adenovirus-mediated expression of DUSP6 in glioblastoma cultures. Protein overexpression inhibits growth by inducing G1-phase delay and increased mitogenic/anchorage dependence and clonogenic potential in vitro. Changes in cell morphology were associated with an increased tumor growth in vivo. Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure and poor outcome in human glioblastomas. Importantly, DUSP6 overexpression increased resistance to cisplatin-mediated cell death in vitro and in vivo. Antisense-mediated depletion of DUSP6 acted in lowering the threshold to anticancer DNA-damaging drugs.

In this study, we used an encapsulated murine packaging cell line to test the effects of in situ delivery of a retrovirus bearing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene in a rat model of orthotopic glioblastoma. Materials and methods: To test gene transfer in vitro, encapsulated murine psi2-VIK packaging cells were co-cultured with baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and the percentage of transfected BHK cells was determined. For in vivo experiments, orthotopic C6 glioblastomas were established in Wistar rats. Capsules containing psi2-VIK cells were stereotaxically implanted into these tumours and the animals were treated with ganciclovir (GCV). Tumours were harvested 14 days after initiation of GCV therapy for morphometric analysis. Results: Encapsulation of psi2-VIK cells increased transfection rates of BHK target cells significantly in vitro compared to psi2-VIK conditioned medium (3 x 10(6) vs 2.3 x 10(4) cells; P<0.001). In vivo treatment with encapsulated packaging cells resulted in 3% to 5% of C6 tumour cells transduced and 45% of tumour volume replaced by necrosis after GCV (P<0.01 compared to controls). Conclusion: In this experimental model of glioblastoma, encapsulation of a xenogeneic packaging cell line increased half-life and transduction efficacy of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and caused significant tumour necrosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12711288
"""Comparative expression study of the endo-G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) repertoire in human glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells, U87-MG cells and non malignant cells of neural origin unveils new potential therapeutic targets.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly aggressive, invasive brain tumors with bad prognosis and unmet medical need. These tumors are heterogeneous being constituted by a variety of cells in different states of differentiation. Among these, cells endowed with stem properties, tumor initiating/propagating properties and particularly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapies are designed as the real culprits for tumor maintenance and relapse after treatment. These cells, termed cancer stem-like cells, have been designed as prominent targets for new and more efficient cancer therapies. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of membrane receptors, play a prominent role in cell signaling, cell communication and crosstalk with the microenvironment. Their role in cancer has been highlighted but remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a descriptive study of the differential expression of the endo-GPCR repertoire in human glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GSCs), U-87 MG cells, human astrocytes and fetal neural stem cells (f-NSCs). The endo-GPCR transcriptome has been studied using Taqman Low Density Arrays. Of the 356 GPCRs investigated, 138 were retained for comparative studies between the different cell types. At the transcriptomic level, eight GPCRs were specifically expressed/overexpressed in GSCs. Seventeen GPCRs appeared specifically expressed in cells with stem properties (GSCs and f-NSCs). Results of GPCR expression at the protein level using mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis are also presented. The comparative GPCR expression study presented here gives clues for new pathways specifically used by GSCs and unveils novel potential therapeutic targets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662753

"""Characterization of genes with increased expression in human glioblastomas.""","""In the present study, we have used the gene expression data available in the SAGE database in an attempt to identify glioblastoma molecular markers. Of 129 genes with more than 5-fold difference found by comparison of nine glioblastoma with five normal brain SAGE libraries, 44 increased their expression in glioblastomas. Most corresponding proteins were involved in angiogenesis, host-tumor immune interplay, multidrug resistance, extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, IGF-signalling, or MAP-kinase pathway. Among them, 16 genes had a high expression both in glioblastomas and in glioblastoma cell lines suggesting their expression in transformed cells. Other 28 genes had an increased expression only in glioblastomas, not in glioblastoma cell lines suggesting an expression possibly originated from host cells. Many of these genes are among the top transcripts in activated macrophages, and involved in immune response and angiogenesis. This altered pattern of gene expression in both host and tumor cells, can be viewed as a molecular marker in the analysis of malignant progression of astrocytic tumors, and as possible clues for the mechanism of disease. Moreover, several genes overexpressed in glioblastomas produce extracellular proteins, thereby providing possible therapeutic targets. Further characterization of these genes will thus allow them to be exploited in molecular classification of glial tumors, diagnosis, prognosis, and anticancer therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16396319

Results: The occurrence of the tumor was preponderant in adults (mean age 55 years old), men (55.82%), and frontal lobe (approximately 40%). The principal motor impairment was hemiparesis, with the exception of 2 cases in the frontal lobe, 2 temporal, 1 parietal, 1 occipital and 1 frontotemporal.

Here, we aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of a glioma-tailored 48-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for integrated glioma diagnosis. We designed a glioma-tailored 48-gene NGS panel for detecting 1p/19q codeletion and mutations in IDH1/2, TP53, PTEN, PDGFRA, NF1, RB1, CDKN2A/B, CDK4, and the TERT promoter (TERTp). We analyzed 106 glioma patients (grade II: 19 cases, grade III: 23 cases, grade IV: 64 cases) using this system. The 1p/19q codeletion was detected precisely in oligodendroglial tumors using our NGS panel. In a cohort of 64 grade Ⅳ gliomas, we identified 56 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Within these IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, 33 samples (58.9%) showed a mutation in TERTp. Notably, PDGFRA mutations and their amplification were more commonly seen in TERTp-wildtype glioblastomas (43%) than in TERTp-mutant glioblastomas (6%) (P = .001). Hierarchical molecular classification of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas revealed 3 distinct groups of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. One major cluster was characterized by mutations in PDGFRA, amplification of CDK4 and PDGFRA, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, and absence of TERTp mutations. This cluster was significantly associated with older age (P = .021), higher Ki-67 score (P = .007), poor prognosis (P = .012), and a periventricular tumor location.

Dissections of the tumor border contacting the dominant SLF caused speech arrests 8 times, with full recovery. At postoperative day 2, edema caused transient mild aphasia and paraphasic errors. Postoperative DTI showed an inferior-lateral resection cavity in immediate proximity to the supracallosal aspect of the left SLF. The case demonstrates excellent correlation between tumor border proximity to the dominant SLF shown at DTI and speech deficits caused by intraoperative dissections and postoperative edema.

Based on the assumption that diverse diseases with similar phenotype associations show similar molecular mechanisms, we presented a pan-cancer network-based prioritization approach to systematically identify disease-specific risk lncRNAs by integrating disease phenotype associations. We applied this strategy to approximately 2800 tumor samples from 14 cancer types for prioritizing disease risk lncRNAs. Our approach yielded an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 80.66%, with the highest AUC (98.14%) for medulloblastoma. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for prioritization of disease candidate genes, the average AUC score of 97.16% was achieved. Moreover, we demonstrated the robustness as well as the integrative importance of this approach, including disease phenotype associations, known disease genes and the numbers of cancer types. Taking glioblastoma multiforme as a case study, we identified a candidate lncRNA gene SNHG1 as a novel disease risk factor for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

"""Glycosylation-related gene expression is linked to differentiation status in glioblastomas undifferentiated cells.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor with still poor prognosis. Tumor initiation, growth and recurrences might depend on Brain Tumor Stem Cells (BTSCs) which can promote tumor aggressiveness and potentially affords new therapeutic target. Recent works emphasized aberrant cell-surface glyco-conjugate expression in brain tumors suggesting that altered glycosylation is closely linked to cancer tumor metastasis and invasive process. Post-translational changes might play a key role in determining the fates of most aggressive and undifferentiated cells such as self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. In order to characterize the glycosylation-related genes involved in differentiation status of the BTSCs, two glioblastoma cell lines, U87-MG and U251 have been cultured according to two conditions leading to undifferentiated floating cells or differentiated adherent cells. The expression level of 559 glycosylation related genes has been analyzed by Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) analysis and allowed to isolate eight up-regulated genes specific of a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells. Protein expression has been confirmed. Among main selected genes, five are also over-expressed in the undifferentiated condition in primary cultures provided by three GBM freshly isolated from patient. This work suggests that new Glycosylation-related gene signature might improve the characterization of the most aggressive and undifferentiated cells and supports that in future, N-linked glycosylation might provide new target to develop therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21899947

To date, no systematic researches have been performed on the expression pattern of miRNA during progression from low grade gliomas to anaplastic gliomas or secondary glioblastomas and those prognostic miRNAs in anaplastic gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. In the present study, high-throughput microarrays were used to measure miRNA expression levels in 116 samples in the different progression stages of glioma. We found that miRNA expression pattern totally altered when low grade gliomas progressed to anaplastic gliomas or secondary glioblastomas. However, anaplastic gliomas and secondary glioblastomas have similar expression pattern in miRNA level. Furthermore, we developed a five-miRNA signature (two protective miRNAs-miR-767-5p, miR-105; three risky miRNAs: miR-584, miR-296-5p and miR-196a) that could identify patients with a high risk of unfavorable outcome in anaplastic gliomas regardless of histology type. It should be highlighted that the five-miRNA signature can also identify patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome in secondary and TCGA Proneural glioblastomas, but not Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal glioblastomas.

"""IDH genotypes differentiation in glioblastomas using DWI and DSC-PWI in the enhancing and peri-enhancing region.""","""Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation has diagnostic and prognostic values in glioblastomas. Peritumoral invasion of glioma cells is a cardinal feature of glioblastomas. Purpose: To evaluate the contribution of DWI and DSC-PWI in the enhancing and peri-enhancing region for discriminating glioblastomas IDH genotypes, and the diagnostic values of combining two techniques in the peri-enhancing region compared with those in the enhancing region. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the conventional MRI (cMRI), DWI and DSC-PWI obtained from 10 patients with IDH-mutated (IDH-m) glioblastomas and 65 patients with IDH wild-type (IDH-w) glioblastomas. Features of cMRI, relative minimum ADC in the enhancing region (rADCmin-t) and peri-enhancing area (rADCmin-p), and relative maximum CBV values in the enhancing region (rCBVmax-t) and peri-enhancing region (rCBVmax-p) were compared between two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis were used to assess diagnostic performance. Results: IDH-m glioblastomas tended to present in frontal lobes and younger patients. The rADCmin-t (P = 0.042) were significantly lower in IDH-w than IDH-m. Both rCBVmax-t and rCBVmax-p showed significant differences between two subgroups (all P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values in prediction of IDH-m were >0.98 for rADCmin-t, <7.27 for rCBVmax-t, and < 0.97 for rCBVmax-p. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the combination of rADCmin-t and rCBVmax-t yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The rCBVmax-t or rCBVmax-p may serve as preferable and comparable imaging biomarkers for evaluation of glioblastomas IDH status.

Methods: The conventional MRI, DWI, and DSC-PWI results of 120 adult patients with IDH wild-type glioblastomas were reviewed retrospectively and their efficacy was analysed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test. Relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADCmin) and relative maximum cerebral blood volume (rCBVmax) values were compared between glioblastomas with different molecular statuses using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression were used to evaluate predictive performance. Results: Glioblastomas with a high p53 LI were more likely to show a well-defined enhancement margin (p=0.047).

Experimental design: We screened glioblastomas from a population-based study for IDH1 mutations and correlated them with clinical data and other genetic alterations. Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8%). Glioblastoma patients with IDH1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with EGFR amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean, 27.1 versus 11.3 months; P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377; 3.7%: P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corresponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95% of cases. Glioblastomas with IDH1 mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of secondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without IDH1 mutations clinically diagnosed as secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggesting that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been misclassified, possibly due to histologic sampling error. Conclusion: IDH1 mutations are a strong predictor of a more favorable prognosis and a highly selective molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas that complements clinical criteria for distinguishing them from primary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19755387

"""p53 mutations versus EGF receptor expression in giant cell glioblastomas.""","""Recent studies have shown that there are distinct genetic pathways leading to the most malignant astrocytic neoplasm, the glioblastoma. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas are characterized by amplification/overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and, less frequently, of the MDM2 gene. Another pathway, operative in the progression of low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas to secondary glioblastomas, is characterized by the frequent occurrence of p53 mutations. In this study, we assessed p53 mutations and EGFR expression in the giant cell glioblastoma. This rare variant is characterized by unusually large, multinucleated giant cells, but tends to be more confined and has been reported to carry a somewhat more favorable prognosis. We analyzed biopsies from 16 patients (mean age at clinical manifestation, 40 years). DNA sequencing revealed that 12 of 16 (75%) giant cell glioblastomas contained a p53 mutation. In 7 patients with two or more surgical interventions, the p53 mutation was already detected in the first biopsy. Focal EGFR overexpression, including multinucleated giant cells, was observed immunohistochemically in 9 of 16 (56%) tumors. However, most tumor areas lacked immunoreactivity, indicating that EGFR overexpression does not play a significant role in the evolution of this glioblastoma variant. These results suggest that giant cell glioblastomas develop de novo with a short preoperative history (mean, 47 +/- 40 days), but contain genetic alterations similar to those observed in secondary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9370234

To identify the parvovirus(es) with the optimal oncolytic effect against human glioblastomas, we screened 12 parvoviruses at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). MVMi, MVMc, MVM-G17, tumor virus X (TVX), canine parvovirus (CPV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), rat parvovirus 1A (RPV1A), and H-3 were relatively ineffective. The four viruses with the greatest oncolytic activity, LuIII, H-1, MVMp, and MVM-G52, were tested for the ability, at a low MOI, to progressively infect the culture over time, causing cell death at a rate higher than that of cell proliferation. LuIII alone was effective in all five human glioblastomas tested. H-1 progressively infected only two of five; MVMp and MVM-G52 were ineffective in all five. To investigate the underlying mechanism of LuIII's phenotype, we used recombinant parvoviruses with the LuIII capsid replacing the MVMp capsid or with molecular alteration of the P4 promoter. The LuIII capsid enhanced efficient replication and oncolysis in MO59J gliomas cells; other gliomas tested required the entire LuIII genome to exhibit enhanced infection. LuIII selectively infected glioma cells over normal glial cells in vitro. In mouse models, human glioblastoma xenografts were selectively infected by LuIII when administered intratumorally; LuIII reduced tumor growth by 75%. LuIII also had the capacity to selectively infect subcutaneous or intracranial gliomas after intravenous inoculation. Intravenous or intracranial LuIII caused no adverse effects.

"""MSH6 mutations arise in glioblastomas during temozolomide therapy and mediate temozolomide resistance.""","""Purpose: Over the past few years, the alkylating agent temozolomide has become the standard-of-care therapy for patients with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor. Recently, large-scale cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified a hypermutation phenotype and inactivating MSH6 mismatch repair gene mutations in recurrent, post-temozolomide glioblastomas, particularly those growing more rapidly during temozolomide treatment. This study aimed to clarify the timing and role of MSH6 mutations in mediating glioblastoma temozolomide resistance. Experimental design: MSH6 sequence and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were determined in matched prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy glioblastomas identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as having posttreatment MSH6 mutations. Temozolomide-resistant lines were derived in vitro through selective growth under temozolomide, and the MSH6 gene was sequenced in resistant clones. The role of MSH6 inactivation in mediating resistance was explored using lentiviral short hairpin RNA knockdown and MSH6 reconstitution. Results: MSH6 mutations were confirmed in posttreatment TCGA glioblastomas but absent in matched pretreatment tumors. The posttreatment hypermutation phenotype displayed a signature bias toward CpC transitions and was not associated with MSI. In vitro modeling through exposure of an MSH6 wild-type glioblastoma line to temozolomide resulted in resistant clones; one clone showed an MSH6 mutation, Thr(1219)Ile, that had been independently noted in two treated TCGA glioblastomas. Knockdown of MSH6 in the glioblastoma line U251 increased resistance to temozolomide cytotoxicity and reconstitution restored cytotoxicity in MSH6-null glioma cells.

Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that FGFR1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in glioblastomas than in normal brain adjacent to the tumor or in untransformed human brain. These results were consistent with immunocytochemical localization of FGFR1 protein in glioblastomas: glioblastoma cells exhibited intense FGFR1 immunoreactivity in frozen sections of tumor and low to undetectable FGFR1 immunoreactivity in adjacent normal brain or in normal white matter obtained from patients without neoplastic disease. Endothelial cells of capillaries and larger vessels within the tumor were devoid of FGFR1 immunoreactivity. All glioblastomas evaluated in the present study expressed FGFR1 mRNA and FGFR1 immunoreactivity. Examination of the FGFR1 gene by Southern blot analysis indicated that overexpression of FGFR1 mRNA in glioblastomas did not result from gene amplification. These results indicate that glioblastoma cells, in contrast to endothelial cells within the tumor, display increased levels of FGFR1. Therefore, FGFR1 signal transduction may be associated with increased autocrine growth activity of tumor cells and is probably not related to the increased endothelial cell proliferation associated with these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8168112

Using in silico analyses of mRNA array and RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 32 core enrichment genes that were highly associated with IGF-1-promoted cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. To investigate the IGF-1-downregulated miRNA signature, microarray-based approaches with IGF-1-treated U87-MG cells and array data in TCGA were used. Four miRNAs, including microRNA (miR)-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-181d, and miR-130b, exhibited an inverse correlation with IGF-1 levels. The miR-181d, that targeted the most IGF-1-related cytokine genes, was significantly reduced in IGF-1-treated glioma cells. Statistical models incorporating both high-IGF-1 and low-miR-181d statuses better predicted poor patient survival, and can be used as an independent prognostic factor in glioblastomas. The C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) and interleukin (IL)-1b demonstrated inverse correlations with miR-181d levels and associations with patient survival. miR-181d significantly attenuated IGF-1-upregulated CCR1 and IL-1b gene expressions.

However, little is known about the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of GLTSCR2 as a tumour suppressor gene. We investigated the pathological significance of GLTSCR2 expression in association with the development and progression of glioblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumour. We used real-time PCR and western blot analysis to examine the expression levels of GLTSCR2 mRNA and protein in glioblastomas, normal brain tissue and in non-glial tumour tissue of different origin, and found that GLTSCR2 expression is down-regulated in glioblastomas. In addition, direct sequencing analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization clearly demonstrates the presence of genetic alterations, such as a nonsense mutation and deletion, in the GLTSCR2 gene in glioblastomas. Finally, our immunohistochemical study demonstrates that GLTSCR2 is sequentially down-regulated according to the histological malignant progression of the astrocytic glial tumour.

The present study examined whether PTEN gene mutations and MIB-1 labeling index (LI) correlate with the dissemination in 39 consecutive patients with glioblastomas. Dissemination was defined as leptomenigeal enhancement by magnetic resonance imaging performed in all patients every 2-3 months. We examined PTEN mutations in 26 patients using cDNA-based direct sequencing and MIB-1 LI in 38 patients. Median survival time of the 39 patients was 16.2 months. Dissemination was found in 17 of 39 patients (43.6%). PTEN mutation was significantly associated with dissemination (P=0.0140), and higher MIB-1 LI (> or =35%) resulted in earlier dissemination (P=0.0156). Kaplan-Meier survival plots showed a significantly poorer survival for patients with PTEN mutation (P=0.0012). The results indicate that the evaluation of PTEN mutation and MIB-1 LI are useful to predict dissemination and prognosis of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14642363
"""Clinicopathological features and molecular analysis of primary glioblastomas in Moroccan patients.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Primary and secondary glioblastomas develop through different genetic pathways. The aim of this study was to determinate the genetic and clinical features of primary glioblastoma in Moroccan patients. The blood and tumor samples were obtained from a group of 34 Moroccan patients affected with primary glioblastoma. The tumors were investigated for TP53, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations using PCR sequencing analysis. Clinicopathological data showed that the mean age at diagnosis of patients was 50.06 years, the sex ratio was 11 F/23 M, and the median of Karnofsky performance score was 60. About 18 % of patients were initially treated by total tumor resection, 41 % by subtotal, and 38 % by partial resection, but biopsy was performed for a single patient (3 %). Twenty-five patients (74 %) received radiotherapy. In addition, the median survival of the all patients was 13 months following diagnosis. There was a significant impact of higher Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (≥80) on overall survival, p-log-rank test = 0.0002, whereas other parameters did not show any significant differences. The molecular analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 3/34 (8.82 %) cases; R273H, R306X, and Q136X. However, none of the analyzed samples contained the R132-IDH1 or R172-IDH2 mutations. These results showed the absence of IDH1 mutation in primary glioblastoma, confirming that this mutation is a hallmark of secondary glioblastoma. It can be used to distinguish primary from secondary glioblastomas. We found also that higher KPS was a significantly favorable factor in patients with primary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22865003
"""Diagnostic utility of diffusion tensor imaging in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.""","""Background and purpose: Differentiation of glioblastomas and solitary brain metastases is an important clinical problem because the treatment strategy can differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential added value of DTI metrics in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases. Materials and methods: One hundred twenty-eight patients with glioblastomas and 93 with brain metastases were retrospectively identified. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values were measured from the enhancing and peritumoral regions of the tumor. Two experienced neuroradiologists independently rated all cases by using conventional MR imaging and DTI. The diagnostic performances of the 2 raters and a DTI-based model were assessed individually and combined. Results: The fractional anisotropy values from the enhancing region of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases (P < .01). There was no difference in mean diffusivity between the 2 tumor types. A classification model based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions differentiated glioblastomas from brain metastases with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, close to those obtained by 2 neuroradiologists using routine clinical images and DTI parameter maps (area under the curve = 0.90 and 0.85). The areas under the curve of the 2 radiologists were further improved to 0.96 and 0.93 by the addition of the DTI classification model. Conclusions: Classification models based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions of the tumor can improve diagnostic performance in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24503556

This study established and analyzed the correlation between tumor location and clinical properties of glioblastomas in frontal and temporal lobes. Methods: This retrospective study determined the location of glioblastomas in the frontal lobe (FL) or temporal lobe (TL) based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, radiologic, and molecular characteristics of FL and TL glioblastomas were compared to define their clinical properties, including sex, age, sides, relationship to ventricle, imaging subtypes, volume, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: The study enrolled 406 patients (182 [44.83%] in FL group and 224 [55.17%] in TL group) with a mean age of 69.8 years. Compared with FL group, TL group had higher incidence of female patients (P = 0.024), tumor location distant to the ventricle (P = 0.006), isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (P = 0.021), promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (P = 0.012), and prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to age ≥60 years at study entry (P = 0.668), sides (P = 0.879), imaging subtypes (P = 0.362), or volume (P = 0.709). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that different tumor locations are associated with diverse clinical properties of glioblastomas in FL and TL.

"""Extent of MGMT promoter methylation correlates with outcome in glioblastomas given temozolomide and radiotherapy.""","""Background: Epigenetic silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) by promoter methylation is associated with improved survival in glioblastomas treated with alkylating agents. In this study, we investigated MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy in a single UK treatment centre. Methods: Quantitative methylation data at individual CpG sites were obtained by pyrosequencing for 109 glioblastomas. Results: Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months with 2-year survival of 17.9%. Pyrosequencing data were reproducible with archival samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. Variation in methylation patterns of discrete CpG sites and intratumoral methylation heterogeneity were observed. A total of 58 out of 109 glioblastomas showed average methylation >non-neoplastic brain in at least one clinical sample; 86% had homogeneous methylation status in multiple samples. Methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Cases with methylation more than 35% had the longest survival (median PFS 19.2; OS 26.2 months, 2-year survival of 59.7%). Significant differences in PFS were seen between those with intermediate or high methylation and unmethylated cases, whereas cases with low, intermediate or high methylation all showed significantly different OS. Conclusions: These data indicate that MGMT methylation is prognostically significant in glioblastomas given chemoradiotherapy in the routine clinic; furthermore, the extent of methylation may be used to provide additional prognostic stratification.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19536096

Materials and methods: TE 30-msec spectra were acquired (1.5 T) from voxels entirely within tumors from 23 glioblastoma patients and 24 metastases patients (3 breast carcinomas, 1 bladder carcinoma, 8 lung carcinomas, 3 probable lung carcinomas, 6 melanomas, 1 stomach carcinoma, and 2 undetermined). Spectra were analyzed quantitatively (LCModel) to determine metabolite, lipid, and macromolecule concentrations. All tumors were previously untreated and classified histopathologically. Results: The lipid peak area (LPA) ratio (total peak area at ca. delta1.3 to that at ca. delta0.9) was 2.6 +/- 0.6 (N = 25) for glioblastomas and 3.8 +/- 1.4 (N = 34) for metastases (P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in metabolite or lipid concentrations between the tumor groups. The LPA ratio provided 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity for discriminating metastases from glioblastomas. Conclusion: Lipid and macromolecule (LM) signals can dominate (1)H spectra of high-grade tumors and have characteristics that allow significant discrimination of metastases from glioblastomas. Work is now needed to determine the source and biophysical characteristics of these LM signals to further improve differentiation by optimizing the data acquisition and analysis protocol.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15269942
"""The long-term risk of malignant astrocytic tumors after structural brain injury--a nationwide cohort study.""","""Background: Neoplastic transformation of damaged astrocytes has been proposed as a possible pathological mechanism behind malignant astrocytic tumors. This study investigated the association between structural brain injuries causing reactive astrogliosis and long-term risk for malignant astrocytic tumors. Methods: The cohort consisted of all individuals living in Denmark between 1978 and 2011. The personal identification number assigned to all individuals allowed retrieval of diagnoses of traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemic infarction, and intracerebral hemorrhage from the National Patient Discharge Register. Diagnoses of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization grades III and IV) were retrieved from the Danish Cancer Registry. Rate ratios (RR's) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression. Results: In a cohort of 8.2 million individuals, 404 812 experienced a structural brain injury and 6152 developed a malignant astrocytic tumor. No significant association was observed 1-4 years after a structural brain injury (RR = 1.14; 95% CI: 0.87-1.46), whereas the long-term (5+ y) risk for malignant astrocytic tumors was significantly reduced (RR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.90) compared with no injury. The specific long-term risks by type of injury were: traumatic brain injury RR = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.10-0.75); cerebral ischemic infarction RR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96); and intracerebral hemorrhage RR = 1.39 (95% CI: 0.64-2.60).

The median survival time for all 175 patients was 14 months and 1-3-year survival (OS) rates were 57%, 34% and 24%, respectively. The median time to tumour progression was 12 months, and 1-3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 43%, 11% and 7%, respectively. Survival analysis showed that of all investigated prognostic factors, only gender did not influence survival. Patients </=55 years did better than those >55 years; patients with KPS 80-100 did better than those with KPS 50-70; patients with frontal tumours did better than those with tumours in other locations; patients with tumours up to 4 cm did better than those with larger tumours, as did patients with either subtotal or gross total tumour resection when compared to those undergoing biopsy only.

"""Glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component - common origin of the different histological parts and genetic subclassification.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and most malignant brain tumors in adults. A small subgroup of glioblastomas contains areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation (GBMO). Our objective was to genetically characterize the oligodendroglial and the astrocytic parts of GBMOs and correlate morphologic and genetic features with clinical data. Methods: The oligodendroglial and the 'classic' glioblastoma parts of 13 GBMO were analyzed separately by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin sections using a custom probe set (regions 1p, 1q, 7q, 10q, 17p, 19q, cen18, 21q) and by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of microdissected paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Results: We identified four distinct genetic subtypes in 13 GBMOs: an 'astrocytic' subtype (9/13) characterized by +7/-10; an 'oligodendroglial' subtype with -1p/-19q (1/13); an 'intermediate' subtype showing +7/-1p (1/13), and an 'other' subtype having none of the former aberrations typical for gliomas (2/13). The different histological tumor parts of GBMO revealed common genetic changes in all tumors and showed additional aberrations specific for each part. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the monoclonal origin of GBMO followed by the development of the astrocytic and oligodendroglial components.

"""Complementary but distinct roles for MRI and 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET in the assessment of human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a primary brain tumor known for its rapid proliferation, diffuse invasion, and prominent neovasculature and necrosis. This study explores the in vivo link between these characteristics and hypoxia by comparing the relative spatial geometry of developing vasculature inferred from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1Gd), edematous tumor extent revealed on T2-weighted MRI (T2), and hypoxia assessed by 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET (18F-FMISO). Given the role of hypoxia in upregulating angiogenic factors, we hypothesized that the distribution of hypoxia seen on 18F-FMISO is correlated spatially and quantitatively with the amount of leaky neovasculature seen on T1Gd. Methods: A total of 24 patients with glioblastoma underwent T1Gd, T2, and 18F-FMISO-11 studies preceded surgical resection or biopsy, 7 followed surgery and preceded radiation therapy, and 11 followed radiation therapy. Abnormal regions seen on the MRI scan were segmented, including the necrotic center (T0), the region of abnormal blood-brain barrier associated with disrupted vasculature (T1Gd), and infiltrating tumor cells and edema (T2). The 18F-FMISO images were scaled to the blood 18F-FMISO activity to create tumor-to-blood ratio (T/B) images. The hypoxic volume (HV) was defined as the region with T/Bs greater than 1.2, and the maximum T/B (T/Bmax) was determined by the voxel with the greatest T/B value. Results: The HV generally occupied a region straddling the outer edge of the T1Gd abnormality and into the T2. A significant correlation between HV and the volume of the T1Gd abnormality that relied on the existence of a large outlier was observed. However, there was consistent correlation between surface areas of all MRI-defined regions and the surface area of the HV. The T/Bmax, typically located within the T1Gd region, was independent of the MRI-defined tumor size. Univariate survival analysis found the most significant predictors of survival to be HV, surface area of HV, surface area of T1Gd, and T/Bmax. Conclusion: Hypoxia may drive the peripheral growth of glioblastomas. This conclusion supports the spatial link between the volumes and surface areas of the hypoxic and MRI regions; the magnitude of hypoxia, T/Bmax, remains independent of size.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19091885

The results of glioblastoma resection in 104 patients operated on between March 2005 and April 2011 were reviewed with the aim to shed some light on the limits between 'sins of action' (operating upon complex tumors causing a permanent severe deficit) and 'sins of non-action' (considering inoperable tumors that can be resected with good results). Fifty-five patients (54.4 %) (Group 1) presented with a 'disputable' surgical indication because of one or more of the following clinico-radiological aspects: involvement of motor and language areas (39.4 %), deep location (7.7 %), corpus callosum infiltration (13.4 %), or major vessels encasement (8.6 %). Forty-six (42.5 %) patients (Group 2) presented with an 'indisputable' surgical indication (readily accessible tumors in non-eloquent areas). Overall mortality was 2.9 %.

NBS1 plays a key role in DNA double-strand break repair and the maintenance of genomic stability. We screened 87 glioblastomas for NBS1 mutations (all 16 exons). Single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing revealed 12 NBS1 mutations (8 missense and 4 intronic mutations) in 9 (32%) of 28 primary (de novo) glioblastomas carrying 2 or more TP53 mutations. None of the NBS1 mutations has been previously reported as a germline mutation in Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients. NBS1 mutations were not detected in 19 primary glioblastomas with 1 TP53 mutation or in 21 primary glioblastomas without TP53 mutations. Secondary glioblastomas that developed through progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma had TP53 mutations in 16 (84%) of 19 cases, but none contained mutations of the NBS1 gene.

"""Flow cytometry in peripheral blood reticulocytes as a marker of chromosome instability in highgrade glioma patients.""","""Introduction: The quantification of chromosomal instability is an important parameter to assess genotoxicity and radiosensitivity. Most conventional techniques require cell cultures or laborious microscopic analyses of chromosomes or nuclei. However, a flow cytometry that selects the reticulocytes has been developed as an alternative for in vivo studies, which expedites the analytical procedures and increases up to 20 times the number of target cells to be analyzed. Objectives: To standardize the flow cytometry parameters for selecting and quantifying the micronucleated reticulocytesCD71+ (MN-RET) from freshly drawn peripheral blood and to quantify the frequency of this abnormal cell subpopulation as a measure of cytogenetic instability in populations of healthy volunteers (n =25), and patients (n=25), recently diagnosed with high-grade gliomas before the onset of treatment. Materials and methods: Blood cells were methanol-fixed and labeled with anti-CD-71-PE for reticulocytes, antiCD-61-FITC for platelet exclusion, and propidium iodide for DNA detection in reticulocytes. The MN-RETCD71+ cell fraction was selected and quantified with an automatic flow cytometer. Results: The standardization of cytometry parameters was described in detail, emphasizing the selection and quantification of the MN-RETCD71+ cellular fraction. The micronuclei basal level was established in healthy controls. In patients, a 5.2-fold increase before the onset of treatment was observed (p <0.05). Conclusion: The data showed the usefulness of flow cytometry coupled with anti-CD-71-PE and anti-CD-61-FITC labeling in circulating reticulocytes as an efficient and high resolution method to quantify chromosome instability in vivo.

In this study, we screened 34 primary (de novo) glioblastomas and 16 secondary glioblastomas that had progressed from low-grade diffuse astrocytomas for alterations of the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes, including homozygous deletion by differential PCR, promoter hypermethylation by methylation-specific PCR, and protein expression by immunohistochemistry. A total of 29 glioblastomas (58%) had a p14ARF homozygous deletion or methylation, and 17 (34%) showed p16INK4a homozygous deletion or methylation. Thirteen glioblastomas showed both p14ARF and p16INK4a homozygous deletion, while nine showed only a p14ARF deletion. Immunohistochemistry revealed loss of p14ARF expression in the majority of glioblastomas (38/50, 76%), and this correlated with the gene status, i.e. homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation. There was no significant difference in the overall frequency of p14ARF and p16INK4a alterations between primary and secondary glioblastomas. The analysis of multiple biopsies from the same patients revealed hypermethylation of p14ARF (5/15 cases) and p16INK4a (1/15 cases) already at the stage of low-grade diffuse astrocytoma but consistent absence of homozygous deletions. These results suggest that aberrant p14ARF expression due to homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation is associated with the evolution of both primary and secondary glioblastomas, and that p14ARF promoter methylation is an early event in subset of astrocytomas that undergo malignant progression to secondary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11303791

"""[A case of primary cerebellar glioblastoma in childhood].""","""Primary cerebellar glioblastomas are exceedingly rare in childhood, with only 19 cases having been reported. We treated a 7-year-old girl with primary cerebellar glioblastoma, who rapidly deteriorated due to cerebrospinal fluid dissemination. The 7-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a history of headache for one month. On admission, increased intracranial pressure and left cerebellar signs were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a ring-enhanced mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere and a low intensity lesion in the pons. The tumor had compressed the fourth ventricle and caused obstructive hydrocephalus. Gross total resection of the left cerebellar tumor was performed. Histological examination revealed nuclear atypia, mitoses, and necrosis, which satisfied the World Health Organizations histological criteria for grade IV astrocytoma. The MIB-1 labeling index was more than 60%. She was treated with adjuvant therapies consisting of 60.2 Gy local irradiation to the posterior fossa, including the brain stem lesion, and chemotherapy using 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU). However, the patient developed of anorexia and vomiting 4 months after surgery, and MRI disclosed local recurrence at the left middle cerebellar peduncle and diffuse dissemination along the lateral ventricle wall. The patient was treated with three-drug chemotherapy using ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide and 39.2 Gy of whole-brain irradiation. However, her condition deteriorated gradually and she died 10 months after admission (6 months after the onset of tumor recurrence).

"""Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 is more extensive in primary (de novo) than in secondary glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas develop de novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastomas). There is increasing evidence that these glioblastoma subtypes develop through different genetic pathways. Primary glioblastomas are characterized by EGFR and MDM2 amplification/overexpression, PTEN mutations, and p16 deletions, whereas secondary glioblastomas frequently contain p53 mutations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 (LOH#10) is the most frequent genetic alteration in glioblastomas; the involvement of tumor suppressor genes, other than PTEN, has been suggested. We carried out deletion mappings on chromosome 10, using PCR-based microsatellite analysis. LOH#10 was detected at similar frequencies in primary (8/17; 47%) and secondary glioblastomas (7/13; 54%). The majority (88%) of primary glioblastomas with LOH#10 showed LOH at all informative markers, suggesting loss of the entire chromosome 10. In contrast, secondary glioblastomas with LOH#10 showed partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q but no loss of 10p. These results are in accordance with the view that LOH on 10q is a major factor in the evolution of glioblastoma multiform as the common phenotypic end point of both genetic pathways, whereas LOH on 10p is largely restricted to the primary (de novo) glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10653004

The objective of this work was to analyse the impact of MGMT promoter methylation in patients with primary diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) relating to survival using a quantitative method (methylation quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA, MethyQESD) by verifying a cut-off point for MGMT methylation provided by the literature (</≥10%) and calculating an optimal cut-off. Methods: 67 patients aged 70 years or younger, operated between January 2013 and December 2015, with newly diagnosed IDH wild-type GBM and clinical follow-up were retrospectively investigated in this study. A known MGMT promoter methylation status was the inclusion criteria. Results: Median overall survival (OS) was 16.9 months. Patients who had a methylated MGMT promoter region of ≥10% had an improved OS compared with patients with a methylated promoter region of <10% (p=0.002). Optimal cut-off point for MGMT promoter methylation was 11.7% (p=0.012). Conclusion: The results confirm that the quantitative level of MGMT promoter methylation is a positive prognostic factor in newly diagnosed patients with GBM. The cut-off provided by the literature (</≥10%) and the calculated optimal cut-off value of 11.7% give a statistically significant separation.

"""Automated differentiation of glioblastomas from intracranial metastases using 3T MR spectroscopic and perfusion data.""","""Purpose: Differentiation of glioblastomas from metastases is clinical important, but may be difficult even for expert observers. To investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms in the differentiation of glioblastomas multiforme (GB) from metastases, we developed and tested a pattern recognition system based on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) data. Materials and methods: Single and multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were performed on 49 patients with solitary brain tumors (35 glioblastoma multiforme and 14 metastases). Metabolic (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, (Lip [Formula: see text] Lac)/Cr) and perfusion (rCBV) parameters were measured in both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. The statistical significance of these parameters was evaluated. For the classification procedure, three datasets were created to find the optimum combination of parameters that provides maximum differentiation. Three machine learning methods were utilized: Naïve-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbor (KNN). The discrimination ability of each classifier was evaluated with quantitative performance metrics. Results: Glioblastoma and metastases were differentiable only in the peritumoral region of these lesions ([Formula: see text]). SVM achieved the highest overall performance (accuracy 98%) for both the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Naïve-Bayes and KNN presented greater variations in performance. The proper selection of datasets plays a very significant role as they are closely correlated to the underlying pathophysiology. Conclusion: The application of pattern recognition techniques using 3T MR-based perfusion and metabolic features may provide incremental diagnostic value in the differentiation of common intraaxial brain tumors, such as glioblastoma versus metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23334798
"""Contribution of diffusion tensor imaging to delineation of gliomas and glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To determine if the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) can differentiate between accompanying edema and tumor cell infiltration of white matter (WM) beyond the tumor edge as defined from conventional MRI in low- and high-grade gliomas. Materials and methods: We examined 12 patients with high-grade gliomas/glioblastomas and eight patients with low-grade gliomas and compared them to 10 patients with meningiomas, in which no tumor infiltration is expected. The tumor was defined as the enhancing area in glioblastomas and meningiomas and as the area of increased T2-signal in low-grade gliomas. FA and MD were measured in the center of the tumor and in the adjacent WM. The contralateral WM and internal capsule were used as an internal standard. Results: Comparing the WM areas of increased T2-signal adjacent to meningiomas and glioblastomas, we saw a trend (without significance) towards a reduction of FA, but not of MD, in glioblastomas. We found no changes of FA and MD in the WM adjacent to low-grade gliomas (without T2-signal increase) compared to the WM of the contralateral hemisphere. In meningiomas and high-grade gliomas/glioblastomas, a narrow rim of significantly (P < 0.01) increased FA and decreased MD values around the enhancing tumor area was seen, whereas in low-grade gliomas, such a rim could not be defined. There was no contribution of FA or MD to grading of gliomas. Conclusion: In glioblastomas, a reduction of FA in the edematous area surrounding the tumor may indicate tumor cell infiltration, but a reliable differentiation between infiltration and vasogenic edema is not yet possible on the basis of DTI. The additional finding of a narrow rim of increased FA and decreased MD at the edge of glioblastomas (as well as in meningiomas) may be caused by com-pressed WM fibers and/or increased vascularity, but does not contribute to exclude peripheral cellular infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15558549

In this study, we introduced the conception of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) gradient in peritumoral edema-the difference in CBF values from the proximity of the enhancing tumor to the normal-appearing white matter, and investigated the contribution of perfusion metrics on the discrimination of glioblastoma from a metastatic lesion. Materials and methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients with glioblastoma or a solitary metastatic lesion underwent three-dimensional arterial spin labeling (3D-ASL) before surgical resection. The CBF values were measured in the peritumoral edema (near: G1; Intermediate: G2; Far: G3). The CBF gradient was calculated as the subtractions CBFG1 -CBFG3, CBFG1 - CBFG2 and CBFG2 - CBFG3. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to seek for the best cutoff value permitting discrimination between these two tumors. Results: The absolute/related CBF values and the CBF gradient in the peritumoral regions of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those in metastases(P < 0.038). ROC curve analysis reveals, a cutoff value of 1.92 ml/100g for the CBF gradient of CBFG1 -CBFG3 generated the best combination of sensitivity (92.86%) and specificity (100.00%) for distinguishing between a glioblastoma and metastasis.

"""Expansion of CD133-positive glioma cells in recurrent de novo glioblastomas after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.""","""Object: Recent evidence suggests that a glioma stem cell subpopulation may determine the biological behavior of tumors, including resistance to therapy. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors examined varying grades of gliomas for stem cell marker expressions and histopathological changes between primary and recurrent tumors. Methods: Tumor samples were collected during surgery from 70 patients with varying grades of gliomas (Grade II in 12 patients, Grade III in 16, and Grade IV in 42) prior to any adjuvant treatment. The samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry for MIB-1, factor VIII, GFAP, and stem cell markers (CD133 and nestin). Histopathological changes were compared between primary and recurrent tumors in 31 patients after radiation treatment and chemotherapy, including high-dose irradiation with additional stereotactic radiosurgery. Results: CD133 expression on glioma cells was confined to de novo glioblastomas but was not observed in lower-grade gliomas. In de novo glioblastomas, the mean percentage of CD133-positive glioma cells in sections obtained at recurrence was 12.2% ± 10.3%, which was significantly higher than that obtained at the primary surgery (1.08% ± 1.78%). CD133 and Ki 67 dual-positive glioma cells were significantly increased in recurrent de novo glioblastomas as compared with those in primary tumors (14.5% ± 6.67% vs 2.16% ± 2.60%, respectively). In contrast, secondary glioblastomas rarely expressed CD133 antigen even after malignant progression following radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: The authors' results indicate that CD133-positive glioma stem cells could survive, change to a proliferative cancer stem cell phenotype, and cause recurrence in cases with de novo glioblastomas after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23991844

"""Increased expression of podoplanin in malignant astrocytic tumors as a novel molecular marker of malignant progression.""","""Podoplanin (aggrus) is a mucin-like transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells. Podoplanin is putatively involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and malignant progression and may be involved in platelet aggregation. Previously, we showed upregulated expression of podoplanin in central nervous system (CNS) germinomas, but not in non-germinomatous germ cell tumors, except for parts of immature teratomas in limited numbers. However, little information exists about its role in CNS astrocytic tumors. In this study, 188 astrocytic tumors (30 diffuse astrocytomas, 43 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 115 glioblastomas) were investigated using immunohistochemistry with an anti-podoplanin antibody, YM-1. In 11 of 43 anaplastic astrocytomas (25.6%) and in 54 of 115 glioblastomas (47.0%), podoplanin was expressed on the surface of anaplastic astrocytoma cells and glioblastoma cells, especially around necrotic areas and proliferating endothelial cells. However, the surrounding brain parenchyma was not stained by YM-1. On the other hand, podoplanin expression was not observed in diffuse astrocytoma (0/30: 0%). Furthermore, we investigated the expression of podoplanin using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in 54 frozen astrocytic tumors (6 diffuse astrocytomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 34 glioblastomas). Podoplanin mRNA and protein expression were markedly higher in glioblastomas than in anaplastic astrocytomas.

Infusion of the virus was preceded by a gadolinium-conjugated diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) test-infusion. In the present study, we analyzed the results of Gd-DTPA test infusion through 50 catheters. Methods: Thirteen adults with a recurrent glioblastoma multiforme were enrolled in a larger phase 1 multicenter, dose-finding study, in which a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus was administered by CED. Up to 4 infusion catheters per patient were placed intra- and/or peritumorally. Before infusion of the virus, a Gd-DTPA infusion was performed for 6 hours, directly followed by a MRI scan. The MRIs were evaluated for catheter position, Gd-DTPA distribution outcome, and contrast leakage. Results: Leakage of Gd-DTPA into the cerebrospinal fluid was detected in 17 of the 50 catheters (34%). Sulcus crossing was the most frequent cause of leakage. In 8 cases, leakage could only be detected on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence. Nonleaking catheters showed a significantly larger Gd-DTPA distribution fraction (volume of distribution/volume of infusion) than leaking catheters (P = 0.009). A significantly lower volume of distribution/volume of infusion was observed in intratumoral catheters, compared with peritumoral catheters (P = 0.004). Gd-DTPA test infusion did not result in significant changes in Karnofsky Performance Score and Neurological Status. Conclusions: Pre-CED treatment infusion of Gd-DTPA is an adequate and safe method to identify dysfunctional catheters.

"""Effect of human skin-derived stem cells on vessel architecture, tumor growth, and tumor invasion in brain tumor animal models.""","""Glioblastomas represent an important cause of cancer-related mortality with poor survival. Despite many advances, the mean survival time has not significantly improved in the last decades. New experimental approaches have shown tumor regression after the grafting of neural stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells into experimental intracranial gliomas of adult rodents. However, the cell source seems to be an important limitation for autologous transplantation in glioblastoma. In the present study, we evaluated the tumor targeting and antitumor activity of human skin-derived stem cells (hSDSCs) in human brain tumor models. The hSDSCs exhibit tumor targeting characteristics in vivo when injected into the controlateral hemisphere or into the tail vein of mice. When implanted directly into glioblastomas, hSDSCs distributed themselves extensively throughout the tumor mass, reduced tumor vessel density, and decreased angiogenic sprouts. In addition, transplanted hSDSCs differentiate into pericyte cell and release high amounts of human transforming growth factor-beta1 with low expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which may contribute to the decreased tumor cell invasion and number of tumor vessels. In long-term experiments, the hSDSCs were also able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to prolong animal survival. Similar behavior was seen when hSDSCs were implanted into two different tumor models, the chicken embryo experimental glioma model and the transgenic Tyrp1-Tag mice. Taken together, these data validate the use of hSDSCs for targeting human brain tumors.

Research on irradiation-induced transcription in glioblastomas can contribute to the understanding of radioresistance mechanisms. In this study, by using the total mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we assayed the global gene expression in a human glioma cell line U251 MG at various time points after exposure to a growth arrest dose of γ-rays. We identified 1656 genes with obvious changes at the transcriptional level in response to irradiation, and these genes were dynamically enriched in various biological processes or pathways, including cell cycle arrest, DNA replication, DNA repair and apoptosis. Interestingly, the results showed that cell death was not induced even many proapoptotic molecules, including death receptor 5 (DR5) and caspases were activated after radiation. The RNA-seq data analysis further revealed that both proapoptosis and antiapoptosis genes were affected by irradiation. Namely, most proapoptosis genes were early continually responsive, whereas antiapoptosis genes were responsive at later stages. Moreover, HMGB1, HMGB2 and TOP2A involved in the positive regulation of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis showed early continual downregulation due to irradiation. Furthermore, targeting of the TRAIL/DR5 pathway after irradiation led to significant apoptotic cell death, accompanied by the recovered gene expression of HMGB1, HMGB2 and TOP2A. Taken together, these results revealed that inactivation of proapoptotic signaling molecules in the nucleus and late activation of antiapoptotic genes may contribute to the radioresistance of gliomas.

The prognostic role of EGFRvIII in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients and changes in EGFRvIII expression in recurrent versus primary glioblastomas remain controversial, but such data are highly relevant for EGFRvIII-targeted therapies.Experimental Design:EGFR-amplified glioblastomas from 106 patients were assessed for EGFRvIII positivity. Changes in EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII status from primary to recurrent glioblastomas were evaluated in 40 patients with EGFR-amplified tumors and 33 patients with EGFR-nonamplified tumors. EGFR single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were assessed in 27 patients. Data were correlated with outcome and validated in 150 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium.Results: Sixty of 106 EGFR-amplified glioblastomas were EGFRvIII-positive (56.6%). EGFRvIII positivity was not associated with different progression-free or overall survival. EGFRvIII status was unchanged at recurrence in 35 of 40 patients with EGFR-amplified primary tumors (87.5%). Four patients lost and one patient gained EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. None of 33 EGFR-nonamplified glioblastomas acquired EGFR amplification or EGFRvIII at recurrence. EGFR SNVs were frequent in EGFR-amplified tumors, but were not linked to survival.Conclusions: EGFRvIII and EGFR SNVs are not prognostic in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients. EGFR amplification is retained in recurrent glioblastomas. Most EGFRvIII-positive glioblastomas maintain EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. However, EGFRvIII expression may change in a subset of patients at recurrence, thus repeated biopsy with reassessment of EGFRvIII status is recommended for patients with recurrent glioblastoma to receive EGFRvIII-targeting agents.

"""Integrated morphologic analysis for the identification and characterization of disease subtypes.""","""Background and objective: Morphologic variations of disease are often linked to underlying molecular events and patient outcome, suggesting that quantitative morphometric analysis may provide further insight into disease mechanisms. In this paper a methodology for the subclassification of disease is developed using image analysis techniques. Morphologic signatures that represent patient-specific tumor morphology are derived from the analysis of hundreds of millions of cells in digitized whole slide images. Clustering these signatures aggregates tumors into groups with cohesive morphologic characteristics. This methodology is demonstrated with an analysis of glioblastoma, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify a prognostically significant morphology-driven subclassification, in which clusters are correlated with transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic events. Materials and methods: Methodology was applied to 162 glioblastomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify morphology-driven clusters and their clinical and molecular correlates. Signatures of patient-specific tumor morphology were generated from analysis of 200 million cells in 462 whole slide images. Morphology-driven clusters were interrogated for associations with patient outcome, response to therapy, molecular classifications, and genetic alterations. An additional layer of deep, genome-wide analysis identified characteristic transcriptional, epigenetic, and copy number variation events. Results and discussion: Analysis of glioblastoma identified three prognostically significant patient clusters (median survival 15.3, 10.7, and 13.0 months, log rank p=1.4e-3). Clustering results were validated in a separate dataset. Clusters were characterized by molecular events in nuclear compartment signaling including developmental and cell cycle checkpoint pathways.

Diffuse CD133 expression was detected in 12 (17.9 %) cases and was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0.010) and progression-free survival (P = 0.017). CD34 and VEGF expression were not associated with prognosis in these samples. IDH1 mutation was detected in ten (14.9 %) cases.

A total of 55 cases were examined by immunohistochemistry using 4 different monoclonal antibodies on frozen or on paraffin sections: EGFR-1 (Amersham), E 62 (Merck), E 30 (Merck), and EMD 55900 (MAB 425, Merck). Definition for inclusion in clinical trials of EMD 55900 was an immunohistochemical overexpression of grade 4+ or 3+ in a scale of 4 grades of staining quality. The use of the 4 different antibodies gave essentially equal results. In 21 cases, the immunohistochemical results were supplemented by molecular genetic analysis of EGFR amplification on the corresponding locus of chromosome 7, using frozen tissue from the same blocks after screening for vital tumor areas. Since no other material was available, the differential polymerase chain reaction technique was applied. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) served as a reference gene. In a preliminary experimental series with cases of known EGFR amplification, a densitometric EGFR/IFN-gamma ratio higher than 3 was determined as indicator for amplification of the EGFR gene. With this experimental approach we were able to identify an amplified EGFR gene in 13 specimens including 2 from recurrent glioblastomas in the same patients. All of these showed an increased immunoreactivity for EGFR protein. The degree of EGFR amplification (EGFR/IFN-gamma ratio as measured by DNA densitometry) showed a positive correlation with the grade of immunohistochemical protein expression, both in regard to the fraction of positive cells and to the overall staining intensity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7671460
"""Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 as a putative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated resistance to O6-alkylating agents in human glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: Pre-existing and acquired drug resistance are major obstacles to the successful treatment of glioblastomas. Methods: We used an integrated resistance model and genomics tools to globally explore molecular factors and cellular pathways mediating resistance to O6-alkylating agents in glioblastoma cells. Results: We identified a transcriptomic signature that predicts a common in vitro and in vivo resistance phenotype to these agents, a proportion of which is imprinted recurrently by gene dosage changes in the resistant glioblastoma genome. This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and survival. Modularity was a predominant organizational principle of the signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping networks. A highly significant network was built around nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which included the persistent alterations of various NF-kappaB pathway elements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) was identified as a new regulatory component of a putative cytoplasmic signaling cascade that mediates NF-kappaB activation in response to DNA damage caused by O6-alkylating agents. Expression of the corresponding zinc finger protein A20 closely mirrored the expression of the TNFAIP3 transcript, and was inversely related to NF-kappaB activation status in the resistant cells. A prediction model based on the resistance signature enabled the subclassification of an independent, validation cohort of 31 glioblastomas into two outcome groups (P = .037) and revealed TNFAIP3 as part of an optimized four-gene predictor associated significantly with patient survival (P = .022). Conclusion: Our results offer strong evidence for TNFAIP3 as a key regulator of the cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-kappaB en route to O6-alkylating agent resistance in glioblastoma cells. This pathway may be an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16365179

"""Stability of the CpG island methylator phenotype during glioma progression and identification of methylated loci in secondary glioblastomas.""","""Background: Grade IV glioblastomas exist in two forms, primary (de novo) glioblastomas (pGBM) that arise without precursor lesions, and the less common secondary glioblastomas (sGBM) which develop from earlier lower grade lesions. Genetic heterogeneity between pGBM and sGBM has been documented as have differences in the methylation of individual genes. A hypermethylator phenotype in grade IV GBMs is now well documented however there has been little comparison between global methylation profiles of pGBM and sGBM samples or of methylation profiles between paired early and late sGBM samples. Methods: We performed genome-wide methylation profiling of 20 matched pairs of early and late gliomas using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips to assess methylation at >485,000 cytosine positions within the human genome. Results: Clustering of our data demonstrated a frequent hypermethylator phenotype that associated with IDH1 mutation in sGBM tumors. In 80% of cases, the hypermethylator status was retained in both the early and late tumor of the same patient, indicating limited alterations to genome-wide methylation during progression and that the CIMP phenotype is an early event. Analysis of hypermethylated loci identified 218 genes frequently methylated across grade II, III and IV tumors indicating a possible role in sGBM tumorigenesis. Comparison of our sGBM data with TCGA pGBM data indicate that IDH1 mutated GBM samples have very similar hypermethylator phenotypes, however the methylation profiles of the majority of samples with WT IDH1 that do not demonstrate a hypermethylator phenotype cluster separately from sGBM samples, indicating underlying differences in methylation profiles. We also identified 180 genes that were methylated only in sGBM. Further analysis of these genes may lead to a better understanding of the pathology of sGBM vs pGBM. Conclusion: This is the first study to have documented genome-wide methylation changes within paired early/late astrocytic gliomas on such a large CpG probe set, revealing a number of genes that maybe relevant to secondary gliomagenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25012071

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the IDH1/2 mutations on the clinical course and genetic alterations of sGBMs, which histopathologically progressed from lower-grade gliomas. We investigated 18 sGBMs, including 8 sGBMs with IDH1/2 mutations (sGBM-Mut) and 10 with wild-type IDH1/2 (sGBM-Wt). The median overall survival time of patients with sGBM-Mut was significantly longer than that of patients with sGBM-Wt (68.2 vs. 25.3 months). The median time from initial diagnosis to sGBM diagnosis was also significantly longer for sGBM-Mut than for sGBM-Wt (50.1 vs. 13.4 months). There was no difference in the median survival time from the sGBM diagnosis between sGBM-Mut and sGBM-Wt (6.75 vs. 6.8 months). All sGBM-Mut (7 of 7) and 6 of 9 sGBM-Wt had TP53 mutations, and the remaining one-thirds of sGBM-Wt had neither TP53 mutations nor 1p/19q codeletion. These observations suggest that IDH1/2 mutations have an impact on the glioma history of sGBM with different genetic pathway. The aggressive progression to sGBM-Wt suggest the need for more intense treatment to the IDH1/2 wild-type tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23494632
"""Promoter hypermethylation of the RB1 gene in glioblastomas.""","""Loss of expression of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) has been shown to occur in up to 25% of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV). To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we assessed RB1 promoter hypermethylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and RB1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 35 primary (de novo) glioblastomas and in 21 secondary glioblastomas that had progressed from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). Promoter hypermethylation was significantly more frequent in secondary (9 of 21, 43%) than in primary glioblastomas (5 of 35, 14%; p = 0.0258). There was a clear correlation between loss of RB1 expression and promoter hypermethylation. In the majority of glioblastomas with loss of RB1 expression, there was promoter hypermethylation (11 of 13, 85%), whereas 93% of tumors with RB1 expression had a normal RB1 gene status (p < 0.0001). In three glioblastomas, areas with and without RB1 expression were microdissected; promoter hypermethylation was detected only in areas lacking RB1 expression. In patients with multiple biopsies, methylation of the RB1 promoter was not detectable in the less malignant precursor lesions, ie, low-grade diffuse and anaplastic astrocytoma. These results indicate that promoter hypermethylation is a late event during astrocytoma progression and is the major mechanism underlying loss of RB1 expression in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11204276
"""Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. Case: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. Results: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. Conclusion: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483326
"""Expression analysis of the autosomal recessive primary microcephaly genes MCPH1 (microcephalin) and MCPH5 (ASPM, abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly associated) in human malignant gliomas.""","""Patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly have a small but architecturally normal brain containing a reduced number of neurons. Microcephalin and ASPM are two of the genes causing this disease. Both are centrosomal proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. Whereas microcephalin is a component of the DNA damage response and a repressor of telomerase function, ASPM is required for the proper formation of a central mitotic spindle and ensures symmetric, proliferative divisions of neuro-epithelial cells. Both proteins are also involved in the regulation of tumor growth. Microcephalin expression is reduced in breast cancer cell lines and human tumors of the ovary and prostate. Reduction in microcephalin mRNA expression correlates with increased chromosomal instability. ASPM mRNA is overexpressed in transformed human cell lines and tumors, and its increased expression is positively associated with proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Glioblastomas are the most prevalent malignant brain tumors in adults, characterized by increased invasiveness, an aggressive local growth pattern and short survival periods of patients. In this study, we analysed the expression of microcephalin mRNA and ASPM mRNA and protein in a panel of 15 glioblastomas and 15 astrocytoma WHO grade II by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Whereas microcephalin expression did not seem to be altered during glioma development, there was a clear increase in ASPM mRNA and protein expression that corresponded with the WHO grade of the tumor. Our findings are significant as the expression of ASPM may be used as a marker for glioma malignancy and represents a potential therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18636190
"""Robust discrimination of glioblastomas from metastatic brain tumors on the basis of single-voxel (1)H MRS.""","""This article investigates methods for the accurate and robust differentiation of metastases from glioblastomas on the basis of single-voxel (1)H MRS information. Single-voxel (1)H MR spectra from a total of 109 patients (78 glioblastomas and 31 metastases) from the multicenter, international INTERPRET database, plus a test set of 40 patients (30 glioblastomas and 10 metastases) from three different centers in the Barcelona (Spain) metropolitan area, were analyzed using a robust method for feature (spectral frequency) selection coupled with a linear-in-the-parameters single-layer perceptron classifier. For the test set, a parsimonious selection of five frequencies yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, and an area under the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Moreover, these accurate results for the discrimination between glioblastomas and metastases were obtained using a small number of frequencies that are amenable to metabolic interpretation, which should ease their use as diagnostic markers. Importantly, the prediction can be expressed as a simple formula based on a linear combination of these frequencies. As a result, new cases could be straightforwardly predicted by integrating this formula into a computer-based medical decision support system. This work also shows that the combination of spectra acquired at different TEs (short TE, 20-32 ms; long TE, 135-144 ms) is key to the successful discrimination between glioblastomas and metastases from single-voxel (1)H MRS.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22081447
"""MGMT promoter hypermethylation in a series of 104 glioblastomas.""","""Aim: To evaluate MGMT promoter hypermethylation as prognostic factor in a retrospective study of 104 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Results: The MGMT gene was found to be methylated in 29 of 101 tumors (28.7%) by MSP, according to the evaluation methods employed. By immunohistochemistry, different categories were identified on the basis of reaction intensity, percentage of positive cells and homogeneous or heterogeneous distribution. MSP did not correlate with immunohistochemistry, with the exception of the category with the highest percentage of positive cells and homogeneity of immunostaining. Western blotting analysis correlated with immunohistochemical findings (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.268, p=0.0211), but not with MSP. By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, radiotherapy was a significant prognostic factor (p=0.0001). When uncensored patients alone were considered, MGMT methylation status showed a significant correlation with survival (p=0.026). Temozolomide therapy correlated with survival (p=0.022), but not with MGMT methylation. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, only radiotherapy remained as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0001). Conclusion: Correlation was inconclusive among MSP, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis, despite the sophisticated score system for the immunohistochemical quantitative evaluation.

"""Evaluation of Peritumoral Brain Parenchyma Using Contrast-Enhanced 3D Fast Imaging Employing Steady-State Acquisition at 3T for Differentiating Metastatic Brain Tumors and Glioblastomas.""","""Background: Metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas are the 2 of the most common brain neoplasms in adults. However, distinguishing solitary metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas on conventional magnetic resonance imaging remains particularly challenging. Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (CE-FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing between metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients with metastatic brain tumors and 14 patients with glioblastomas underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CE-FIESTA before surgery. First, 1 neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon classified the CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma by consensus. Next, the 2 neuroradiologists performed an observer performance study comparing tumor shape classification (smooth or irregular margins), a classic imaging finding, with the CE-FIESTA classification of the peritumoral brain parenchyma. Results: The CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma were classified as follows: type A, no hyperintense rim; type B, partial hyperintense rim; and type C, extended hyperintense rim. With regard to the diagnosis of metastatic brain tumors, the observer performance study demonstrated that the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of an extended hyperintense rim classification (type C) on CE-FIESTA images were 95.3%, 85.7%, and 93.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the CE-FIESTA classification was significantly higher than that of the tumor shape classification.

A small subgroup of glioblastomas contains areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation (GBMO). Our objective was to genetically characterize the oligodendroglial and the astrocytic parts of GBMOs and correlate morphologic and genetic features with clinical data. Methods: The oligodendroglial and the 'classic' glioblastoma parts of 13 GBMO were analyzed separately by interphase fluoreszence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin sections using a custom probe set (regions 1p, 1q, 7q, 10q, 17p, 19q, cen18, 21q) and by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of microdissected paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Results: We identified four distinct genetic subtypes in 13 GBMOs: an 'astrocytic' subtype (9/13) characterized by +7/-10; an 'oligodendroglial' subtype with -1p/-19q (1/13); an 'intermediate' subtype showing +7/-1p (1/13), and an 'other' subtype having none of the former aberrations typical for gliomas (2/13). The different histological tumor parts of GBMO revealed common genetic changes in all tumors and showed additional aberrations specific for each part. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the monoclonal origin of GBMO followed by the development of the astrocytic and oligodendroglial components.

In the present study, we assessed MGMT promoter methylation and polymorphisms (Leu84Phe, Ile143Val, c.-56C>T) in 371 glioblastomas diagnosed at the population level. MGMT methylation was observed in 165 (44%) glioblastomas, with a higher frequency in females than males (53 vs. 39%; p = 0.0106) and in secondary than primary glioblastomas (73 vs. 43%; p = 0.0074).

"""Frequent LOH on 22q12.3 and TIMP-3 inactivation occur in the progression to secondary glioblastomas.""","""Frequent allelic losses on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q) in gliomas indicate the presence of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) at this location. However, the target gene(s) residing in this chromosome are still unknown and their putative roles in the development of astrocytic tumors, especially in secondary glioblastoma, have not yet been defined. To compile a precise physical map for the region of common deletions in astrocytic tumors, we performed a high-density loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using 31 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning 22q in a series of grade II diffuse astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, primary glioblastomas, and secondary glioblastomas that had evolved from lower grade astrocytomas. LOH was found at one or more loci in 33% (12/36) of grade II diffuse astrocytomas, in 40% (4/10) of anaplastic astrocytomas, in 41% (26/64) of primary glioblastomas, and in 82% (23/28) of secondary glioblastomas. Characterization of the 22q deletions in primary glioblastomas identified two sites of minimally deleted regions at 22q12.3-13.2 and 22q13.31. Interestingly, 22 of 23 secondary glioblastomas affected shared a deletion in the same small (957 kb) region of 22q12.3, a region in which the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) is located. Investigation of the promoter methylation and expression of this gene indicated that frequent hypermethylation correlated with loss of TIMP-3 expression in secondary glioblastoma. This epigenetic change was significantly correlated to poor survival in eight patients with grade II diffuse astrocytoma. Our results suggest that a 957 kb locus, located at 22q12.3, may contain the putative TSG, TIMP-3, that appears to be relevant to progression to secondary glioblastoma and subsequently to the prognosis of grade II diffuse astrocytoma. In addition, the possibility of other putative TSGs on 22q12.3-13.2 and 22q13.31 that may also be involved in the development of primary glioblastomas cannot be ruled out.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592495

HRK expression was significantly reduced in 61% of secondary glioblastomas as compared to other types of tumors, and aberrant methylation was closely associated with loss of expression. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis also demonstrated a clear agreement between reduced HRK protein levels and low or absent HRK transcripts. Lack of HRK immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with a low apoptotic index, whereas a strong association between methylation status and apoptosis was found only in secondary glioblastomas. Abnormal methylation of HRK was detected in astrocytic tumors concurrent with methylation of multiple genes, including p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). Interestingly, these epigenetic changes in secondary glioblastoma were further associated with wild-type p53.

Patterns of care were compared for different age groups using the chi-square test. Results: In both patient groups, age turned out to be an independent risk factor. Older age was associated with worse overall survival. Independent of the cut-off age (< 50 years vs. > or = 50 years, < 60 years vs. > or = 60 years, < 65 years vs. > or = 65 years, and < 70 years vs. > or = 70 years), there were no statistically significant differences between the age groups concerning the use of different imaging modalities (computed tomography scans vs. magnetic resonance imaging), type of surgery (none vs. biopsy vs. resection), waiting time for radiotherapy (< median vs. > or = median), radiotherapy treatment planning (simulator-based vs. computer-based), use of radiation sources (cobalt unit vs. linear accelerator), and fractionation protocols (conventional vs. modified). When the recruitment period of 21 years was divided into 3 intervals, impressive changes with regard to the patterns of care became apparent. However, the changes were seen similarly throughout the different age groups. Conclusions: Older age did not limit access to state-of-the-art patterns of care in neurooncology.

"""Proliferative activity in human glioblastomas: evaluation of different Ki67 equivalent antibodies.""","""Aims: Determination of proliferative activity in human gliomas may be of clinical importance. Immunohistochemical estimation of the proliferative index with the prototypic monoclonal antibody Ki67 is often used but has the disadvantage that it must be carried out on frozen material. However, novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies have been developed for use on formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded tissue. In this study, the prototypic Ki67 antibody and several new Ki67 equivalent antibodies were tested on human glioblastoma tissue. Methods: Eleven glioblastomas were included in the study. The antibodies used were the prototypic monoclonal Ki67 and the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies MIB1 (monoclonal), NC-MM1 (monoclonal), NC-Ki67p (polyclonal), and rabbit antihuman Ki67 antigen (polyclonal). The prototypic Ki67 was used on frozen sections and the other Ki67 antibodies on microwave oven heated, formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded sections. Results: All antibodies exhibited specific granular nuclear staining of weak to strong intensity. In some tumours the labelling indices were within the same range, whereas in others the antibodies elicited divergent values. Conclusions: All the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies provided satisfactory staining on paraffin sections. However, a significant spread of labelling indices was recorded in some cases. Therefore, Ki67 immunostaining is encumbered with some degree of uncertainty and requires further optimisation before it can be regarded as a reliable prognostic marker.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9350303
"""Haplotype-specific expression of the human PDGFRA gene correlates with the risk of glioblastomas.""","""Aberrant expression of the platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor (PDGFRA) gene has been associated with various diseases, including neural tube defects and gliomas. We have previously identified 5 distinct haplotypes for the PDGFRA promoter region, designated H1, H2alpha, H2beta, H2gamma and H2delta. Of these haplotypes H1 and H2alpha are the most common, whereby H1 drives low and H2alpha high transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays. Here we have investigated the role of these PDGFRA promoter haplotypes in gliomagenesis at both the genetic and cellular level. In a case-control study on 71 glioblastoma patients, we observed a clear underrepresentation of H1 alleles, with pH1 = 0.141 in patients and pH1 = 0.211 in a combined Western European control group (n = 998, p < 0.05). Furthermore, in 3 out of 4 available H1/H2alpha heterozygous human glioblastoma cell lines, H1-derived mRNA levels were more than 10-fold lower than from H2alpha, resulting at least in part from haplotype-specific epigenetic differences such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Together, these results indicate that PDGFRA promoter haplotypes may predispose to gliomas. We propose a model in which PDGFRA is upregulated in a haplotype-specific manner during neural stem cell differentiation, which affects the pool size of cells that can later undergo gliomagenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18464291
"""An experimental model for anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma using adult F344 rats and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea.""","""An experimental model for induction of gliomas corresponding to human anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas is reported. Eleven week old F344 and ACI rats were given 100 or 200 p.p.m. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) solution as their drinking water for 42 weeks. Gliomas were induced at very high incidences (82.5-92.5%) in each group. Induced gliomas showed apparent evidence of morphologic malignancy by an analysis based on diagnostic criteria of human astrocytomas. All of the gliomas from the killed animals were classified histologically into subtypes according to the classification scheme used in the diagnosis of human gliomas. The majority of macrotumors more than 1 mm in diameter in both strains were diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells in these tumors were almost negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, while ultrastructurally neoplastic astrocytes contained glial filaments. A strain difference was observed in the ratio of histological subtypes of macrotumors. In F344 rats, astrocytic tumors diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas of an astrocytic type formed the majority, whereas glioblastomas of mixed oligo-astrocytic type predominated in ACI rats.

"""Diversity and frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in human glioblastomas.""","""Several types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been reported in glioblastomas, and in nearly all cases the alterations have been reported in tumors with EGFR amplification. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency and diversity of EGFR mutations in glioblastomas and to determine whether gene mutation is inevitably associated with increased EGFR gene dosage. To accomplish these aims, we sequenced cDNA products representing the entire EGFR coding region in 44 glioblastomas, half of which had EGFR amplification. Coding sequence alterations were identified in 17 of the tumors, and each of these cases had amplified EGFR. No mutations were identified in the 22 tumors without EGFR amplification. An additional 26 glioblastomas with EGFR amplification were then examined to establish more reliable frequencies for each type of mutation identified in the tumors for which the entire gene was sequenced. Transcripts associated with the most common mutation lacked coding sequence for amino acids 6-273 (67%). This mutation has been described extensively in the literature. Transcripts encoding receptors that would truncate at amino acid 958 and transcripts encoding receptors that would lack amino acids 521-603 were the next most common types of alteration. Each of these were observed in 15% of the tumors with EGFR amplification. Other mutations were observed at lower frequencies, but among these were three cases with missense mutations. Sixteen of the 48 tumors with EGFR amplification showed multiple types of EGFR mutations (33%), and in one case it was determined that multiple alterations had occurred in the same transcript. In total, these data are consistent with EGFR mutation being exclusively and frequently associated with EGFR amplification. Furthermore, the determination of multiple EGFR mutations within individual tumors suggests that glioblastomas with EGFR amplification have the capacity to produce a variety of functionally distinct EGFRs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10728703
"""The relationship between the capillary structure and hemorrhage in gliomas.""","""A 48-year-old man was admitted with the sudden onset of symptoms of stroke caused by hemorrhage in an oligodendroglioma. Despite surgery and antiedema treatment, the patient died. Histological evaluation revealed an oligodendroglioma with calcified capillaries of the retiform type. To further investigate this phenomenon, a total of 160 gliomas were reviewed: 90 glioblastomas multiforme, 30 oligodendrogliomas, and 40 astrocytomas. Sufficient data were available for clinical evaluation in 100 cases. Of these, 5% (two oligodendrogliomas and three glioblastomas multiforme) were related to clinically significant hemorrhages. Of the remaining cases, microhemorrhages were found in 53.0% of the glioblastomas, in 56.7% of the oligodendrogliomas, and in 10.0% of the astrocytomas. In each case reviewed, the capillaries were assigned to one of three groups: axial, retiform, or glomeruloid. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between hemorrhages and retiform capillaries in all three types of tumors, except that in oligodendrogliomas the statistical significance held true when calcification of the capillaries was also present. Glomeruloid-type capillaries were only weakly associated with hemorrhages, and no association was found for axial capillaries. A large-scale prospective study is necessary to more precisely assess the role of each of the three types of capillaries in hemorrhages of gliomas. Based on data available so far, patients with glial tumors with retiform capillaries, confirmed on biopsy, should be carefully monitored to exclude possible intratumoral hemorrhage.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3031239

A mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG2A) (mAb 425) (EMD55900) (Merck KGaA, Bernstadt, Germany) directed against EGF-R was produced for therapeutic use. Eight patients with primary or recurrent, EGF-R-positive glioblastomas entered the study, which was designed to evaluate the clinical effect of the mAb. In order to achieve a high tumor cell saturation, the mAb was injected intratumorally twice weekly through an implantable catheter. The total administered dose varied between 4 mg and 120 mg. In 3 patients with solid tumors, a massive tumor necrosis was noted, with infiltration of macrophages, granulocytes and T cells. A further 3 patients developed clinical and radiological signs of an intense, local, inflammatory reaction. There may be a relation between the mAb dosage and the antitumor effect, insofar as higher doses seemed to cause a more pronounced, inflammatory reaction. Of the 8 patients, 6 developed human, anti-(mouse Ig) antibodies. This anti-EGF-R mAb may induce an intense, inflammatory reaction and a considerable necrosis in glioblastoma. However, the planned schedule could not be completed, even after the dose level was re-adjusted, owing to inflammatory reactions, which were severe without prior tumor debulking.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9191875

We recently reported that mutations of the p53 gene are present in more than two-thirds of secondary glioblastomas but rarely occur in primary glioblastomas, suggesting the presence of different genetic pathways (Watanabe et al, Brain Pathol 1996:6:217-24). In the present study, primary and secondary glioblastomas were screened by immunohistochemistry for MDM2 overexpression and by differential PCR for gene amplification. Tumor cells immunoreactive to MDM2 were found in 15 of 29 primary glioblastomas (52%), but in only 3 of 27 secondary glioblastomas (11%; P=0.0015). MDM2 amplification occurred in 2 primary (7%) glioblastomas but in none of the secondary glioblastomas. Only one out of 15 primary glioblastomas overexpressing MDM2 contained a p53 mutation.

"""Heterogeneous activation of the TGFbeta pathway in glioblastomas identified by gene expression-based classification using TGFbeta-responsive genes.""","""Background: TGFbeta has emerged as an attractive target for the therapeutic intervention of glioblastomas. Aberrant TGFbeta overproduction in glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas has been reported, however, to date, none of these reports has systematically examined the components of TGFbeta signaling to gain a comprehensive view of TGFbeta activation in large cohorts of human glioma patients. Methods: TGFbeta activation in mammalian cells leads to a transcriptional program that typically affects 5-10% of the genes in the genome. To systematically examine the status of TGFbeta activation in high-grade glial tumors, we compiled a gene set of transcriptional response to TGFbeta stimulation from tissue culture and in vivo animal studies. These genes were used to examine the status of TGFbeta activation in high-grade gliomas including a large cohort of glioblastomas. Unsupervised and supervised classification analysis was performed in two independent, publicly available glioma microarray datasets. Results: Unsupervised and supervised classification using the TGFbeta-responsive gene list in two independent glial tumor gene expression data sets revealed various levels of TGFbeta activation in these tumors. Among glioblastomas, one of the most devastating human cancers, two subgroups were identified that showed distinct TGFbeta activation patterns as measured from transcriptional responses. Approximately 62% of glioblastoma samples analyzed showed strong TGFbeta activation, while the rest showed a weak TGFbeta transcriptional response. Conclusion: Our findings suggest heterogeneous TGFbeta activation in glioblastomas, which may cause potential differences in responses to anti-TGFbeta therapies in these two distinct subgroups of glioblastomas patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19192267
"""Quantitative telomerase expression in glioblastomas shows regional variation and down-regulation with therapy but no correlation with patient outcome.""","""Despite the nearly ubiquitous expression of telomerase in almost all types of malignant human tumors, studies have shown widely varying positivity in the highest-grade glioma, the glioblastomas (GBMs), ranging from 26% to 100% of tumors analyzed. We have previously shown significant variability in positive versus negative telomerase expression from region to region within the same GBM. In this study, we hypothesized that application of new quantitative methodology would extend our previous observations and identify whether there is heterogeneity in levels of protein expression even within areas positive for telomerase in high-grade gliomas. Finally, we sought to correlate quantitative telomerase expression with patient outcome and therapeutic response. Quantitative analysis was achieved by polymerase chain-based TRAP assay with phosphorimager analysis and compared with clinical information obtained from 19 patients, most with primary, untreated GBMs. Results showed up to 3-fold variability in telomerase levels across multiple regional samples from the same patient, as well as between patients. In 5 of 6 patients with recurrent tumors who had received intervening radiation therapy or chemotherapy, telomerase was downregulated in the second, post-therapy sample. These data provide in vivo corroboration of recent in vitro experiments showing telomerase downregulation after radiation therapy or chemotherapy treatment of cell lines. Our finding of variability in levels of telomerase expression in GBMs parallels the known heterogeneity of these tumors for histologic features and cell growth-related factors.

Preoperative seizures occurred in 14 (14%) patients. Seizures at presentation were significantly correlated with pathological grades of astrocytic tumors (p = 0.0318). The risk of seizures at presentation was greatest in patients with well-differentiated astrocytomas as compared with anaplastic astrocytomas (Odds ratio = 4.364, p = 0.056) or glioblastomas multiforme (Odds ratio = 5.673, p = 0.007).

Methods and materials: In 18 patients with histologically proven (8x biopsy, 10x subtotal resection) primary brain tumors (8 astrocytomas grade III, one mixed glioma grade III, and 9 glioblastomas), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA and FDG-PET were performed in radiation treatment position within the same week. A computer program was developed for fusion of the PET and MR images. On corresponding axial slices, FDG uptake was compared to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted and to signal hyperintensity in T2-weighted MR images. Based on PET and MRI data, three-dimensional treatment planning was performed. All patients underwent linear accelerator (LINAC) radiotherapy. Results: In MRI, all tumors and the surrounding edema were visible as hyperintense lesions in the T2-weighted images. 17/18 tumors showed contrast enhancement. In FDG-PET, 16 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal white matter, whereas only 8/18 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal gray matter. White matter edema was associated with decreased FDG uptake in all patients. The area of increased FDG uptake correlated closely with contrast enhancement, only in one case the volume of increased FDG uptake was larger than the area of contrast enhancement. Mean tumor volumes obtained by MRI T1 + Gd, T2, and PET were 30, 106, and 10 ml, respectively. Survival was comparable to data in the literature with a 1-year survival of 39% and a median survival of 310 days. Conclusion: Only in a minority of patients did FDG-PET provide additional information for radiation treatment planning.

The maximum antitumor effect was achieved with the combination of polyamine-pGL1-TNF-alpha and radiation. Each modality used alone, including polyamine, modestly slowed tumor growth. In vitro evaluations of blood, spleen, and tumor indicated that the antitumor mechanisms of combination therapy may include, at least partly, the recruitment and activation of nonspecific effector cells.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) affects the radiosensitivity of human glioblastoma xenografts during fractionated irradiation. Material and methods: Anemia was induced by total body irradiation (TBI, 2 x 4 Gy) of mice prior to tumor implantation into the subcuts of the hind leg. In one experimental group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (750 U/kg s.c.) given three times weekly starting 10 days prior to TBI. 13 days after tumor implantation (tumor volume approx. 40 mm3), fractionated irradiation (4 x 7 Gy, one daily fraction) of the glioblastomas was performed resulting in a growth delay with subsequent regrowth of the tumors. Results: Compared to nonanemic control animals (hemoglobin concentration cHb = 14.7 g/dl), the growth delay in anemic mice (cHb = 9.9 g/dl) was significantly shorter (49 +/- 5 days vs. 79 +/- 4 days to reach four times the initial tumor volume) upon fractionated radiation. The prevention of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (cHb = 13.3 g/dl) resulted in a significantly prolonged growth delay (61 +/- 5 days) compared to the anemia group, even though the growth inhibition found in control animals was not completely achieved. Conclusions: These data indicate that moderate anemia significantly reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy.

Methods and results: Forty-five astrocytic tumours, including 18 pilocytic astrocytomas, 14 astrocytomas, four anaplastic astrocytomas and nine glioblastomas, from 45 children and young adults, between 1 and 29 years (mean 11 years) of age, were examined pathologically, and sections from paraffin-embedded blocks were used for MIB-1 and p53 immunostaining. The MIB-1 labelling index and the frequency and intensity of p53 staining in both the pilocytic astrocytoma and the astrocytoma group were significantly lower than in the anaplastic astrocytoma plus glioblastoma group (P < 0.001). In 11.1% (two of 18) of pilocytic astrocytomas and 42.9% (six of 14) of astrocytomas, immunoreactivity of either MIB-1 or p53 staining was of almost the same intensity as that of anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. However, in these cases, results using both MIB-1 and p53 stain differed from those for anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Conclusions: MIB-1 and p53 co-staining is very useful for differentiating pilocytic astrocytomas and astrocytomas from anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. However, MIB-1 or p53 staining alone cannot differentiate pilocytic astrocytomas and astrocytomas from anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9839169
"""p53 status has no prognostic significance in glioblastomas treated with radiotherapy.""","""Mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and accumulation of the p53 protein are common events in the range of cerebral astrocytic tumors, including glioblastomas, but it is uncertain whether these events are associated with prognosis. Evidence suggests that the response of various tumors to radiotherapy may be influenced by the status of p53 which is involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. This study tests the hypothesis that p53 governs survival in patients (n = 62) with glioblastomas who have received radiotherapy. Analysis of TP53 and p53 immunohistochemistry were undertaken using standard methods. TP53 mutations were present in 27% tumors, while 50% were p53-immunopositive (LI > 3%). A strong correlation (p < 0.0001) was found between a high p53 LI (> 50%) and the presence of a mutation, but p53 status at the level of gene or protein was unrelated to survival. Radiation-induced apoptosis that is independent of p53, and the presence in glioblastomas of genetic abnormalities that are also involved in the cellular response to radiation, such as deletions and mutations of pRb, are possible explanations of this result.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9401801

Their malignant counterparts, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, are lethal neoplasms with poor clinical outcome and they frequently carry mutations of TP53 tumor suppressor gene. In order to determine the frequency and type of this molecular alteration in the Polish population, we analyzed the polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to the most conservative exons 5-8 for single-strand conformation polymorphism and confirmed the presence of mutations by direct DNA sequencing. We identified mutations in one of five (20%) anaplastic astrocytomas and in eight of 28 (29%) glioblastomas; the mutations were most frequently identified in the exon 8 (six glioblastomas). The frequency of TP53 mutations is thus similar to the corresponding data from other studies, and the type of mutations suggests the participation of endogenous etiological factor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9529927

However, the causative mechanism of peritumoral edema has yet to be clarified. In this study, seventy patients with brain tumors (34 glioblastomas, 21 meningiomas and 13 metastatic tumors) were examined by CT scan with and without contrast medium infusion and by postoperative histologic verification in all cases. Peritumoral hypodensity areas on CT scan have generally been interpreted as cerebral edema. Peritumoral edema as seen in CT scan was classified into four grades according to the ratio of the largest diameter of tumor and the size of the zone of edema. Grade 0: no peritumoral low density area is seen in CT scan. Grade I: a small amount of peritumoral low density area is seen in CT scan. Grade II: a moderate amount of peritumoral low density area is seen is CT scan. Grade III: a large amount of peritumoral low density area is seen in CT scan. Twenty-five out of 34 glioblastomas and all of 15 metastatic tumors demonstrated moderate or severe peritumoral edemas such as Grade II or III. However 16 out of 21 meningiomas demonstrated mild peritumoral edemas such as Grade 0 or I. The grade of peritumoral edema was closely related to the degree of malignancy of the brain tumors. 8 out of 9 glioblastomas which demonstrated slight peritumoral edema, Grade I, had large cystic formations which seemed to serve as buffer action to compression mechanism by brain tumors. The grade of peritumoral edema was also related to the location of the tumor and venous involvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6098291

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such information provided useful, complementary information to conventional MRI for improving the evaluation of glioblastoma extent. Ten patients with glioblastoma multiforme underwent conventional MRI, proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Metabolite signals, including normalized choline, N-acetylaspartate, creatine and lactate/lipids, were obtained by 1H-MRSI; apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) by DWI; and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) by PWI. In edematous-appearing areas, 3 multiparametric patterns were identified: infiltrating tumor, with abnormal metabolite ratios, lower ADC and higher rCBV; pure edema, with normal metabolite ratios, higher ADC and lower rCBV; and tumor-infiltrated edema, with abnormal metabolite ratios and intermediate ADC and rCBV. In normal-appearing areas, 2 multiparametric patterns were identified: tumor-infiltrated tissue, with abnormal metabolite ratios and higher rCBV; and normal tissue, with normal MR parameters. The combination of 1H-MRSI, DWI and PWI features contributed to delineation of glioblastomas, offering information not available with conventional MRI.

The expression of the PTEN protein in glioblastomas also shows great intratumour heterogeneity, but the significance of this heterogeneity has so far received little attention. Methods: We conducted a comparative study on paraffin and frozen samples from 60 glioblastomas. Based on PTEN immunostaining, paraffin glioblastomas were divided into positive (homogeneous staining) and both positive and negative (heterogeneous staining) tumours. DNA was extracted from manually microdissected samples from representative areas, and from frozen samples taken randomly from the same tumours. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 10q23 and hypermethylation status of the PTEN promoter were studied, and the molecular findings were correlated with overall survival. Results: PTEN protein was present heterogeneously in 42 cases and homogeneously in 18 cases. In homogeneous glioblastomas, no correlation was found between PTEN protein expression and the LOH of the gene. Surprisingly, in the heterogeneous glioblastomas, LOH was found significantly more frequently (P < 0.001) in PTEN-positive areas (81%) than in PTEN-negative ones (35.7%). In general, molecular results of frozen tissue were representative of the tumour. Only two cases of methylation of the PTEN promoter were identified. A significant difference was found for overall survival for LOH10q23 status (P = 0.005) and for homogeneous vs. heterogeneous tumours (P = 0.014). Conclusion: The expression of PTEN protein does not correlate with the abnormalities of the LOH of the gene.

Methods: The role of Tlr-4 in the antitumoral effect of LPS on glioblastomas was assessed in wild-type BALB/c mice and in Tlr-4 knockout (KO) BALB/c mice. Mice were implanted with DBT glioblastoma cells intracranially or subcutaneously, were treated with intratumoral LPS, and were assessed by histopathological examination for degrees of tumor progression and inflammation. Flow cytometry and Western blotting with antibodies to the Tlr-4 receptor and flow cytometry to the related CD14 moiety were performed to quantitate the expression levels of these two receptors by glioblastoma cells. Results: For subcutaneous tumors, LPS caused near complete tumor elimination in wild-type mice, but only a 50% reduction in Tlr-4 KO mice. For mice implanted with intracranial glioblastomas, LPS increased survival times modestly in wild-type mice, but showed no benefit in the Tlr-4 KO mice. There were no histological differences among wild-type and Tlr-4 KO mice, except for tumor size. In both models, an early neutrophilic and later macrophage-rich inflammatory infiltrate were seen after LPS administration. Quantitative flow cytometry and Western blotting showed no Tlr-4 receptor or CD14 expression in murine and human glioblastoma cells in vitro, and Western blotting suggested that Tlr-4 effects are mediated by nontumoral elements such as microglia and inflammatory cells.

Although the strategy of maximum safe resection is widely accepted, the rates of complete resection of enhancing tumor (CRET) and the exact causes for motor deficits (mechanical vs vascular) are not always known. The authors report the results of their concept of combining monopolar mapping and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-guided surgery in patients with glioblastoma adjacent to eloquent tissue. Methods: The authors prospectively studied 72 consecutive patients who underwent 5-ALA-guided surgery for a glioblastoma adjacent to the corticospinal tract (CST; < 10 mm) with continuous dynamic monopolar motor mapping (short-train interstimulus interval 4.0 msec, pulse duration 500 μsec) coupled to an acoustic motor evoked potential (MEP) alarm. The extent of resection was determined based on early (< 48 hours) postoperative MRI findings. Motor function was assessed 1 day after surgery, at discharge, and at 3 months. Results: Five patients were excluded because of nonadherence to protocol; thus, 67 patients were evaluated. The lowest motor threshold reached during individual surgery was as follows (motor threshold, number of patients): > 20 mA, n = 8; 11-20 mA, n = 13; 6-10 mA, n = 10; 4-5 mA, n = 13; and 1-3 mA, n = 23.

At 3 months, 3 patients (4%) had a persisting postoperative motor deficit, 2 caused by vascular injury and 1 by mechanical injury. The rates of intra- and postoperative seizures were 1% and 0%, respectively. Complete resection of enhancing tumor was achieved in 73% of patients (49/67) despite proximity to the CST. Conclusions: A rather high rate of CRET can be achieved in glioblastomas in motor eloquent areas via a combination of 5-ALA for tumor identification and intraoperative mapping for distinguishing between presumed and actual motor eloquent tissues.

Significance analysis of microarrays was used for genes significantly differently methylated between 33 pGBM and nine sGBM. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between curves were assessed using the log-rank test. Then, we treated glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U251) with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidines (5-aza-dC) and detected cell biological behaviors. Results: Microarray data analysis identified TES promoter was hypermethylated in pGBMs compared with sGBMs (P < 0.05). Survival curves from the Kaplan-Meier method analysis revealed that the patients with TES hypermethylation had a short overall survival (P < 0.05). This abnormality is also confirmed in glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U251). Treating these cells with 5-aza-dC released TES protein expression resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Hypermethylation of TES gene promoter highly correlated with worse outcome in pGBM patients. TES might represent a valuable prognostic marker for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23769558
"""VEGF promotes tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma stem cells.""","""There is increasing evidence for the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in malignant brain tumors, and these CSCs may play a pivotal role in tumor initiation, growth, and recurrence. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and the neurogenesis of neural stem cells. Using CSCs derived from human glioblastomas and a retrovirus expressing VEGF, we examined the effects of VEGF on the properties of CSCs in vitro and in vivo. Although VEGF did not affect the property of CSCs in vitro, the injection of mouse brains with VEGF-expressing CSCs led to the massive expansion of vascular-rich GBM, tumor-associated hemorrhage, and high morbidity, suggesting that VEGF promoted tumorigenesis via angiogenesis. These results revealed that VEGF induced the proliferation of VEC in the vascular-rich tumor environment, the so-called stem cell niche.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17618600
"""Selective sensitivity to radiation of cerebral glioblastomas harboring p53 mutations.""","""Recent studies suggest that a balance may exist between the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing functions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Adenoviral p21 transduction attenuates apoptosis, whereas deletion of the p21 gene promotes it, and p21-null xenografts respond better than isogenic p21-wild type tumors to irradiation. Hence, the role of p53 in dictating the clinical response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be more complex than previously thought. We have analyzed survival and radiation response (regrowth-free period) of 42 patients with glioblastomas whose p53 status was determined by a sensitive yeast functional assay. Multivariate analysis revealed that p53 mutation is associated with longer survival (P < 0.02). Among 36 radiation-treated patients, the regrowth-free period after treatment was significantly longer for tumors with p53 mutations (P < 0.0001), and p53 mutation was the sole independent factor predictive of radiotherapeutic response (P < 0.01). Survival time after regrowth was independent of p53 status, suggesting that the difference in survival was related to the treatment rather than to the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor. Thus, in this Northern Japanese population, p53 mutation is a marker for better radiation response in glioblastomas, and this results in significantly longer survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9581814
"""Multidimensional communication in the microenvirons of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are heterogeneous and invariably lethal tumours. They are characterized by genetic and epigenetic variations among tumour cells, which makes the development of therapies that eradicate all tumour cells challenging and currently impossible. An important component of glioblastoma growth is communication with and manipulation of other cells in the brain environs, which supports tumour progression and resistance to therapy. Glioblastoma cells recruit innate immune cells and change their phenotype to support tumour growth. Tumour cells also suppress adaptive immune responses, and our increasing understanding of how T cells access the brain and how the tumour thwarts the immune response offers new strategies for mobilizing an antitumour response. Tumours also subvert normal brain cells - including endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes - to create a microenviron that favours tumour success. Overall, after glioblastoma-induced phenotypic modifications, normal cells cooperate with tumour cells to promote tumour proliferation, invasion of the brain, immune suppression and angiogenesis. This glioblastoma takeover of the brain involves multiple modes of communication, including soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines, direct cell-cell contact, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes and microvesicles) and connecting nanotubes and microtubes. Understanding these multidimensional communications between the tumour and the cells in its environs could open new avenues for therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985475

Our study was designed to identify effective biomarkers for GBM prognosis analysis and development of precise treatments. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GBM patients and controls were analyzed from the Xena database and GEPIA. Based on the screened DEGs, univariate COX and LASSO regression analysis were performed to identify the most relevant genes associated with GBM prognosis. Genes highly expressed in GBM patients were selected to construct receiver operating characteristic analysis and enrichment analysis was constructed on groups of high and low expression of adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1). CIBERSORT, ssGSEA and ESTIMATE were used to perform immune infiltration analysis. About 3297 DEGs were identified using data from Xena database; 8 prognostic genes were identified. AEBP1, which plays a role in neuronal differentiation and development, was positively correlated in GBMs with immune infiltration; its high expression in cancer patients is associated with short overall survival and advanced tumor staging. This study suggests that AEBP1 could serve as a prognostic marker for GBMs and that patients with high expression may have a better response to immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39190880

Currently, it is unknown whether multiple types of transformed precursors, which display alternative sets of the complement of properties of true cancer stem cells, can be found in a GBM. If different subsets of such cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) do exist, they might represent distinct cell targets, with a differential therapeutic importance, also depending on their characteristics and lineage relationship. Here, we report the presence of two types of CSCs within different regions of the same human GBM. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis shows that the two types of CSCs bear quite diverse tumorigenic potential and distinct genetic anomalies, and, yet, derive from common ancestor cells.

The highest frequencies of copy number losses were detected on TBR1 (52.6%), BMI1 (52.6%), EGR2 (47.4%), DMBT1 (47.4%), MTAP (42.1%), and FGFR2 (42.1%). The copy number gains of CDKN1C and INS and the copy number losses of TBR1 were significantly correlated with longer survival of patients. High-level amplifications were identified on EGFR, SAS/CDK4, PDGFRA, MDM2, and ARSA. These genes are assumed to be involved in tumorigenesis or progression of glioblastomas. The first attempts to apply detrended fluctuation analysis to copy number profiles by considering the reading direction as the time axis demonstrated that higher long-term fractal scaling exponents (alpha2) correlated well with longer survival of glioblastoma patients. The present study indicates that array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis has great potential for assessment of copy number changes and altered chromosomal regions of brain tumors.

Patients with high/moderate expression of ANGPTL3 had a significantly shorter survival time (6.3 months) than those (median survival time 13.8 months) with low/negative expression. The overall survival (OS) was also investigated and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, which showed a significant difference (P=0.0045, Breslow test).

"""Recurrent Glioblastomas Reveal Molecular Subtypes Associated with Mechanistic Implications of Drug-Resistance.""","""Previously, transcriptomic profiling studies have shown distinct molecular subtypes of glioblastomas. It has also been suggested that the recurrence of glioblastomas could be achieved by transcriptomic reprograming of tumors, however, their characteristics are not yet fully understood. Here, to gain the mechanistic insights on the molecular phenotypes of recurrent glioblastomas, gene expression profiling was performed on the 43 cases of glioblastomas including 15 paired primary and recurrent cases. Unsupervised clustering analyses revealed two subtypes of G1 and G2, which were characterized by proliferation and neuron-like gene expression traits, respectively. While the primary tumors were classified as G1 subtype, the recurrent glioblastomas showed two distinct expression types. Compared to paired primary tumors, the recurrent tumors in G1 subtype did not show expression alteration. By contrast, the recurrent tumors in G2 subtype showed expression changes from proliferation type to neuron-like one. We also observed the expression of stemness-related genes in G1 recurrent tumors and the altered expression of DNA-repair genes (i.e., AURK, HOX, MGMT, and MSH6) in the G2 recurrent tumors, which might be responsible for the acquisition of drug resistance mechanism during tumor recurrence in a subtype-specific manner. We suggest that recurrent glioblastomas may choose two different strategies for transcriptomic reprograming to escape the chemotherapeutic treatment during tumor recurrence.

"""Screen for IDH1, IDH2, IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH mutations in glioblastoma.""","""Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyse oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH1 functions in the cytosol and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are both localized in the mitochondria. Heterozygous somatic mutations in IDH1 occur at codon 132 in 70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBMs), and in 5% of primary GBMs. Mutations in IDH2 at codon 172 are present in grade II-III gliomas at a low frequency. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations cause both loss of normal enzyme function and gain-of-function, causing reduction of α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) which accumulates. Excess hydroxyglutarate (2HG) can also be caused by germline mutations in D- and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenases (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). If loss of IDH function is critical for tumourigenesis, we might expect some tumours to acquire somatic IDH3 mutations. Alternatively, if 2HG accumulation is critical, some tumours might acquire somatic D2HGDH or L2HGDH mutations. We therefore screened 47 glioblastoma samples looking for changes in these genes. Although IDH1 R132H was identified in 12% of samples, no mutations were identified in any of the other genes. This suggests that mutations in IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH do not occur at an appreciable frequency in GBM. One explanation is simply that mono-allelic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur more frequently by chance than the bi-allelic mutations expected at IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH. Alternatively, both loss of IDH function and 2HG accumulation might be required for tumourigenesis, and only IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have these dual effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21625441

Given that the IDH status has critical effects on the survival and epigenetic features of glioblastoma, we aimed to assess the role of MGMT promoter methylation in IDH-mutant glioblastoma. Methods: This study included 187 IDH-mutant glioblastomas and used 173 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas for comparison. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression were used to study the predictive effects. Results: Compared with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, IDH-mutant glioblastomas showed significantly higher (P < 0.0001) MGMT promoter methylation. We demonstrated that MGMT promoter methylation status, as determined by a high cutoff value (≥30%) in pyrosequencing, could be used to significantly stratify the survival of 50 IDH-mutant glioblastomas receiving temozolomide therapy (cohort A); this result was validated in another cohort of 25 IDH-mutant glioblastomas (cohort B). The median progression-free survival and median overall survival in cohort A were 9.33 and 13.76 months for unmethylated cases, and 18.37 and 41.61 months for methylated cases, and in cohort B were 6.97 and 9.10 months for unmethylated cases, and 23.40 and 26.40 months for methylated cases. In addition, we confirmed that the MGMT promoter methylation was significantly (P = 0.0001) correlated with longer OS in IDH-mutant patients with GBM, independently of age, gender distribution, tumor type (primary or recurrent/secondary), and the extent of resection.

Increasing evidences suggest that glioblastoma resistance to existing radio- and chemotherapies rely on glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are endowed with a unique combination of stem-like properties alike to normal neural stem cells (NSCs), and of tumor initiating properties. The natural polyphenol resveratrol is known to exert opposite actions on neural cells according to their normal or cancerous status. Here, we used resveratrol to explore the molecular mechanisms differing between GSCs and NSCs. We observed a dual action of resveratrol on GSCs: resveratrol blocked GSC proliferation up to 150 μM and induced their necrosis at higher doses. On the opposite, resveratrol had no effect on NSC behavior. To determine the mechanisms underlying resveratrol effects, we focused our attention on the family of NAD-dependent deacetylases sirtuins (SIRT). A member of this family, SIRT1, has been repetitively shown to constitute a preferential resveratrol target, at least in normal cells. Western blot analysis showed that SIRT1 and SIRT3 were expressed by both GSCs and NSCs whereas SIRT2 expression was restricted to GSCs. Pharmacological blockade of SIRT2 activity or down-regulation of SIRT2 expression with siRNAs counteracted the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on cell proliferation. On the contrary, inhibition of SIRT2 activity or expression did not counteract GSC necrosis observed in presence of high doses of resveratrol.

In this lesion, the mutation was observed in both, areas of astrocytic differentiation and areas of epithelial differentiation. One tumor diagnosed as GBM with epithelial differentiation carried C-->T transition in codon 211 in both, areas of astrocytic and epithelial differentiation.

Here we generated two genetic GBM models de novo in immunocompetent mouse brains, mimicking essential pathological and molecular features of human GBMs. Lineage-tracing and transplantation studies demonstrated that, although blood vessels in GBM brains underwent drastic remodeling, evidence of trans-differentiation of GBM cells into vascular cells was barely detected. Intriguingly, GBM cells could promiscuously express markers for mural cells during gliomagenesis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that patterns of copy number variations (CNVs) of mural cells and ECs were distinct from those of GBM cells, indicating discrete origins of GBM cells and vascular components. Importantly, single-cell CNV analysis of human GBM specimens also suggested that GBM cells and vascular cells are likely separate lineages. Rather than expansion owing to trans-differentiation, vascular cell expanded by proliferation during tumorigenesis. Therefore, cross-lineage trans-differentiation of GBM cells is very unlikely to occur during gliomagenesis.

Case report: A 46-year-old male with no relevant medical history or cardiovascular risk factors who presented with acute hemiplegia on the right-hand side of the body and a significantly impaired level of consciousness. Computerised axial tomography of the brain showed a left frontal malignant ischemic infarct that exerted an important mass effect. The patient was submitted to a left-side frontoparietal decompressive craniectomy. Post-operative progress was good and the patient even recovered his normal level of consciousness, although he was left with right hemiparesis and conduction dysphasia. Seven months after the craniectomy the patient experienced a progressive deterioration with symptoms of endocranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed the presence of a highly malignant tumour in the previously infarcted territory. A histological study of the excised lesion showed it to be a glioblastoma multiforme. Conclusions: The proximity in time, as well as the identical location of the two lesions, led us to think that the glioblastoma, although not yet visible in radiological explorations, affected a branch of the middle cerebral artery and gave rise to the infarct. Therefore, in the presence of a cerebral infarct in patients with no risk factors for suffering a brain vascular pathology, it is advisable to carry out a radiological follow-up so as to be able to diagnose a possible lesion due to a tumour.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15696424

The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, and Ki-67 labeling index were calculated from the tumor specimen. Cutoff values were identified by analyzing a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the multivariate survival statistical technique was performed to determine the significant and independent parameters for predicting overall survival. Results: The multivariate Cox analysis showed that the maximum/mean relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) ratio and the Ki-67 labeling index were significant and independent predictive parameters with a cutoff value of 1.589 for the maximum rCBF ratio, 1.286 for the mean rCBF ratio, and 19% for the Ki-67 labeling index and hazard ratios of 6.132 and 5.119, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with higher rCBF ratios and Ki-67 labeling indices had a shorter overall survival than others, with median overall survival durations of 479 (95% CI, 370-559) and 1243 (95% CI, 666-NA) days, respectively (P = 0.000167). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the preoperative rCBF ratio and Ki-67 labeling index are useful parameters for predicting the overall survival of cerebral glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33567368
"""The Glycoprotein M6a Is Associated with Invasiveness and Radioresistance of Glioblastoma Stem Cells.""","""Systematic recurrence of glioblastoma (GB) despite surgery and chemo-radiotherapy is due to GB stem cells (GBSC), which are particularly invasive and radioresistant. Therefore, there is a need to identify new factors that might be targeted to decrease GBSC invasive capabilities as well as radioresistance. Patient-derived GBSC were used in this study to demonstrate a higher expression of the glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A) in invasive GBSC compared to non-invasive cells. In 3D invasion assays performed on primary neurospheres of GBSC, we showed that blocking GPM6A expression by siRNA significantly reduced cell invasion. We also demonstrated a high correlation of GPM6A with the oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPRZ1, which regulates GPM6A expression and cell invasion. The results of our study also show that GPM6A and PTPRZ1 are crucial for GBSC sphere formation. Finally, we demonstrated that targeting GPM6A or PTPRZ1 in GBSC increases the radiosensitivity of GBSC. Our results suggest that blocking GPM6A or PTPRZ1 could represent an interesting approach in the treatment of glioblastoma since it would simultaneously target proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35883571

The initial magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a lesion in the left uncus thought to be recovering hemorrhage. Subsequent MRI, however revealed the mass to be expanding. A neuroendoscopical biopsy of the lesion established a diagnosis of glioblastoma.

"""Seizures as presenting symptom in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Objective: The clinical course and underlying molecular causes in patients with glioblastoma presenting with seizures are poorly understood. Here we investigated clinical features and carrier systems as well as a transaminase relevant in glutamate homeostasis in patients with glioblastoma. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of our clinical glioma database for clinical data during a 2-year period. Patients with glioblastoma were divided into 2 groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic for seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and tissue samples from both groups were investigated. A Cox regression analysis was performed for survival and clinical and molecular features. Results: One hundred three patients diagnosed with glioblastoma in this period were identified. Twenty-three patients were symptomatic with seizures (22.3%). All were IDH-1/2 wild-type. We found no significant difference in the tumor localization between the groups. Patients with seizures from glioblastoma had significantly smaller tumors, which caused less edema compared to nonepileptogenic tumors. A significantly increased up-regulation of glutamate carrier systems was evident in symptomatic tumors compared to asymptomatic tumors. Moreover, there seems to be an oversupply of glutamate in symptomatic tumors due to dysregulation in glutamate synthesis. Significance: Glioblastoma presenting with seizures is morphologically different from asymptomatic tumors. Furthermore, we were able to show that the molecular profile of these tumors, particularly glutamate homeostasis controlling systems, is significantly different.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30536819
"""The in vitro effects of caffeine on viability, cycle cycle profiles, proliferation, and apoptosis of glioblastomas.""","""Objective: We studied the effects of caffeine on cell viability, cell cycle profiles, proliferation, and apoptosis in rat C6 and human U87MG glioblastoma cell lines. Materials and methods: Cell viability was quantified by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the relative number of cells in different phases of the cell cycle, while cell proliferation was quantified using the Cell Counting Kit-8. The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry, and expression of apoptosis-related proteins Caspase-3, Cyt-C, Bax and Bcl-2 by Western blot. Results: Caffeine at doses of up to 0.5 mM did not affect cell viability in both rat C6 and human U87MG glioblastoma cells. Further studies were done using the dose of 0.5 mM. Percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase was markedly increased, while percentage of cells in the S phase decreased, after cell treatment with caffeine. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by caffeine. Furthermore, caffeine induced cell apoptosis, decreased expression of Bcl-2, and increased expression of Cyt-C and Caspase-3.

"""Endothelial cell ferroptosis influences IDH wild-type glioblastoma growth in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients.""","""Glioblastomas are known for their poor clinical prognosis, with recurrent tumors often exhibiting greater invasiveness and faster growth rates compared to primary tumors. To understand the intratumoral changes driving this phenomenon, we employed single-cell sequencing to analyze the differences between two pairs of primary and recurrent glioblastomas. Our findings revealed an upregulation of ferroptosis in endothelial cells within recurrent tumors, identified by the significant overexpression of the NOX4 gene. Further analysis indicated that knocking down NOX4 in endothelial cells reduced the activity of the ferroptosis pathway. Utilizing conditioned media from endothelial cells with lower ferroptosis activity, we observed a decrease in the growth rate of glioblastoma cells. These results highlighted the complex role of ferroptosis within tumors and suggested that targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of glioblastomas requires careful consideration of its effects on endothelial cells, as it may otherwise produce counterproductive outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38985083

Methods: Ten pairs of initial and recurrent frozen IDHwt glioblastoma samples were screened by CGH Array. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was then performed on an enriched cohort of 19 pairs. MPDZ alterations were analyzed using TCGA dataset. Results: Nineteen IDHwt glioblastoma patients were included. Median age was 54.5 y/o (37.2-72.8). Using CGH array, unsupervised analysis aggregated the cohort by paired initial and recurrent tumors. Only 44% of CGH Array alterations were conserved at recurrence (amplifications: 55%; deletions: 30%). Two regions (including FPR1, 2 and 3) were lost at relapse: 19q13.33 and 19q13.41. MPDZ and 25 other genes were altered in ≥20% of recurrent tumors. NGS analysis of 29 candidate genes revealed 4 genes with pathogenic mutations: (FPR2, REL, TYRP1 and MPDZ). MPDZ (Multiple PDZ Domain Crumbs Cell Polarity Complex Component) was altered by two pathogenic mutations occurring at relapse. Using TCGA dataset we observed that a lower MPDZ mRNA expression was associated with IDHwt (p < 0.001) and grade IV (p < 0.001) gliomas. Finally, a low mRNA MPDZ expression was significantly correlated to poor overall survival in both IDHwt and IDH mutated gliomas, reinforcing the potential pejorative impact of MPDZ loss. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MPDZ is more frequently altered at relapse after radio-chemotherapy in glioblastoma IDHwt patients, suggesting that MPDZ impairment could contribute to the systematic resistance of these tumors opening new therapeutic perspectives.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35259554

Uncontrolled cellular proliferation, lack of apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis are among the biologic processes that render these tumors both aggressive and difficult to treat. An understanding of the genetics and molecular events regulating these aggressive tumors is beginning to emerge, partly because of recent knowledge in genomics, gene expression analysis, and mouse tumor models. As a result, it is now generally accepted that brain tumors, particularly those arising from cells of glial lineage, result from stepwise accumulation of deleterious genetic alterations. Several genetic abnormalities have been described, and current research is aimed at elucidating their causal association with brain tumor formation and progression.

"""Does age matter? - A MRI study on peritumoral edema in newly diagnosed primary glioblastoma.""","""Background: Peritumoral edema is a characteristic feature of malignant glioma related to the extent of neovascularisation and to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.The extent of peritumoral edema and VEGF expression may be prognostic for patients with glioblastoma. As older age is a negative prognostic marker and as VEGF expression is reported to be increased in primary glioblastoma of older patients, age-related differences in the extent of peritumoral edema have been assessed. Methods: In a retrospective, single-center study, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of steroid-naïve patients (n = 122) of all age groups were analysed. Patients with clinically suspected, radiologically likely or known evidence of secondary glioblastoma were not included.Extent of brain edema was determined in a metric quantitative fashion and in a categorical fashion in relation to tumor size. Analysis was done group-wise related to age. Additionally, tumor size, degree of necrosis, superficial or deep location of tumor and anatomic localization in the brain were recorded. Results: The extent of peritumoral edema in patients >65 years (ys) was not different from the edema extent in patients ≤ 65 ys (p = 0.261). The same was true if age groups ≤ 55 ys and ≥ 70 ys were compared (p = 0.308). However, extent of necrosis (p = 0.023), deep tumor localization (p = 0.02) and frontal localisation (p = 0.016) of the tumor were associated with the extent of edema. Tumor size was not linearly correlated to edema extent (Pearson F = 0.094, p = 0.303) but correlated to degree of necrosis (F = 0.355, p < 0.001, Spearman-Rho) and depth of tumor (p < 0.001). In a multifactorial analysis of maximum edema with the uncorrelated factors age, regional location of tumor and degree of necrosis, only the extent of necrosis (p = 0.022) had a significant effect. Conclusion: Age at diagnosis does not determine degree of peritumoral edema, and tumor localization in the white matter is associated with greater extent of edema. The area of necrosis is reflective of volume of edema. In summary, the radiographic appearance of a glioblastoma at diagnosis does not reflect biology in the elderly patient.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21481277
"""A Ferroptosis-Related Prognostic Risk Score Model to Predict Clinical Significance and Immunogenic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Multiforme.""","""Background: Ferroptosis is a recently identified cell death pathway, and the susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers varies among cancer cell types. There have been recent attempts to clarify the mechanisms implicated in ferroptosis, glioma invasion, and the immune microenvironment but little is known about ferroptosis regulation in GBM. Methods: Screening ferroptosis-related genes from published reports and existing databases, we constructed an integrated model based on the RNA-sequencing data in GBM. The association of FRGPRS and overall survival is identified and validated across several different datasets. Genomic and clinical characteristics, immune infiltration, enriched pathways, pan-cancer, drug resistance, and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy are compared among various FRGPRS subgroups. Results: We identified and confirmed the influences of five ferroptosis key hub genes in the FRGPRS model. The FRGPRS model could serve to predict overall survival and progression-free survival in GBM patients, and high FRGPRS was associated with comparatively stronger immunity, higher proportions of tumour tissue, and good cytolytic immune and chemotherapeutics response in GBM patients. Conclusions: The five ferroptosis key hub genes constituting the FRGPRS model could serve to predict overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with GBM and help guide timely and efficacious therapeutic strategies customised and optimised for each individual patient. This discovery may lay the foundation for the development and optimisation of other iterations of this model for the improved forecasting, detection, and treatment of other malignancies notorious for their drug resistance and immune escape.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34804371

"""Impact of the methylation classifier and ancillary methods on CNS tumor diagnostics.""","""Background: Accurate CNS tumor diagnosis can be challenging, and methylation profiling can serve as an adjunct to classify diagnostically difficult cases. Methods: An integrated diagnostic approach was employed for a consecutive series of 1258 surgical neuropathology samples obtained primarily in a consultation practice over 2-year period. DNA methylation profiling and classification using the DKFZ/Heidelberg CNS tumor classifier was performed, as well as unsupervised analyses of methylation data. Ancillary testing, where relevant, was performed. Results: Among the received cases in consultation, a high-confidence methylation classifier score (>0.84) was reached in 66.4% of cases. The classifier impacted the diagnosis in 46.7% of these high-confidence classifier score cases, including a substantially new diagnosis in 26.9% cases. Among the 289 cases received with only a descriptive diagnosis, methylation was able to resolve approximately half (144, 49.8%) with high-confidence scores. Additional methods were able to resolve diagnostic uncertainty in 41.6% of the low-score cases. Tumor purity was significantly associated with classifier score (P = 1.15e-11). Deconvolution demonstrated that suspected glioblastomas (GBMs) matching as control/inflammatory brain tissue could be resolved into GBM methylation profiles, which provided a proof-of-concept approach to resolve tumor classification in the setting of low tumor purity. Conclusions: This work assesses the impact of a methylation classifier and additional methods in a consultative practice by defining the proportions with concordant vs change in diagnosis in a set of diagnostically challenging CNS tumors.

Several studies have shown that TERTp mutations are associated with clinicopathological features; in some instances, TERTp mutations were considered as biomarkers of poor prognosis. The rs2853669 SNP, located in the TERT promoter region, was reported to modulate the increased TERT expression levels induced by the recurrent somatic mutations. In this study we aimed to determine the frequency and prognostic value of TERTp mutations and TERT rs2853669 SNP in 504 gliomas from Portuguese and Brazilian patients. TERTp mutations were detected in 47.8% of gliomas (216/452). Glioblastomas (GBM) exhibited the highest frequency of TERTp mutations (66.9%); in this glioma subtype, we found a significant association between TERTp mutations and poor prognosis, regardless of the population. Moreover, in a multivariate analysis, TERTp mutations were the only independent prognostic factor. Our data also showed that the poor prognosis conferred by TERTp mutations was restricted to GBM patients carrying the rs2853669 A allele and not in those carrying the G allele. In conclusion, the presence of TERTp mutations was associated with worse prognosis in GBM patients, although such association depended on the status of the rs2853669 SNP. The status of the rs2853669 SNP should be taken in consideration when assessing the prognostic value of TERTp mutations in GBM patients.

To further address the role of NDRG2 as a candidate tumor suppressor in human gliomas, we analyzed 67 astrocytic tumors (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 11 anaplastic astrocytomas, 34 primary glioblastomas and 12 secondary glioblastomas) for NDRG2 gene mutation, promoter methylation and expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Using real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis, we found decreased NDRG2 mRNA levels in primary glioblastomas as compared to diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas. Similarly, immunohistochemistry revealed low or absent NDRG2 protein expression in primary glioblastomas. Mutational analysis of the entire NDRG2 coding sequence did not reveal any tumor-associated DNA sequence alterations. However, sequencing of sodium bisulfite-modified DNA identified hypermethylation of the NDRG2 promoter region in 21 of 34 primary glioblastomas (62%). Moreover, NDRG2 promoter hypermethylation was associated with decreased NDRG2 mRNA expression. In contrast to primary glioblastomas, NDRG2 promoter hypermethylation was detected in only 1 of 11 anaplastic astrocytomas (9%) and was absent in 10 diffuse astrocytomas and 12 secondary glioblastomas.

Nuclear antigen analysis of diploid tumors showed a higher mean p105 fluorescence of S + G2M cells than G0G1 cells from the same case but there were no apparent differences in p105 expression by histologic subtype. Aneuploid tumors showed enhanced expression of p105 relative to diploid cells.

"""IDHwt glioblastomas can be stratified by their transcriptional response to standard treatment, with implications for targeted therapy.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors lacking IDH1 mutations (IDHwt) have the worst prognosis of all brain neoplasms. Patients receive surgery and chemoradiotherapy but tumors almost always fatally recur. Results: Using RNA sequencing data from 107 pairs of pre- and post-standard treatment locally recurrent IDHwt GBM tumors, we identify two responder subtypes based on longitudinal changes in gene expression. In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. Conclusions: We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment. Stratifying GBM tumors by responder subtype may lead to more effective treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38326875

The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Methods: In an observational, retrospective, single-center study, the authors examined the medical records of 976 adults newly diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype between January 2000 and January 2021. They analyzed clinical-, imaging-, and treatment-related factors associated with 2-year and 5-year survival. Results: The median overall survival was 11.2 months (12.2 months for patients included after 2005 and the introduction of standard combined chemoradiotherapy). The median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (10.0 months for patients included after 2005). Overall, 17.6% of patients reached a 2-year overall survival, while 2.2% of patients reached a 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, 6.6% of patients survived 2 years without progression, while 1.1% of patients survived 5 years without progression. Two factors that were consistently associated with 2-year and 5-year survival were first-line oncological treatment with standard combined chemoradiotherapy and methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter. Other factors that were significantly associated with 2-year or 5-year survival were age at diagnosis ≤ 60 years, headaches or signs of raised intracranial pressure at diagnosis, cortical contact of contrast enhancement, no contrast enhancement crossing the midline on initial imaging, total or subtotal tumor resection, and a second line of oncological treatment at recurrence. Within 21 cases of 5-year survival, 18 were confirmed to be glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype, and 7 of the 5-year survivors (38.9%) had additional genetic alterations: 3 cases had an FGFR mutation or fusion, 3 cases had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 case had a PTPN11 mutation, and 1 case had a PMS2 mutation in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome. Conclusions: Five-year overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is extremely low. Predictors of a longer survival are mostly treatment factors, emphasizing the importance of a complete oncological treatment plan, when achievable.

The clinical data, including demographic data, tumor characteristics, treatment strategy, expression pattern of tumor markers, and survival data, were retrospectively reviewed. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test, while multivariate analysis Cox regression model was used to investigate risk factors for mortality. Results: In this patient cohort, glioblastoma (40%), diffuse glioma (14.6%) and oligodendroglioma (9.6%) were the most common pathological types. The expression of Ki-67 was associated with several clinicopathological parameters (e.g. tumor type, grade, and number of lesions). In addition, Ki-67 correlated with the mortality within the first year of the post-treatment follow-up (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Maier analysis revealed that older patients (≥ 45 years) displayed worse prognosis than those aged under 45 years (P = 0.038). Dismal prognosis was also associated with clinical parameters, including high tumor grade, multiple lesions, and Karnofsky performance score (KPS). Multivariate analysis showed that low KPS (< 85) increased the risk of mortality by 2.3 folds with a 95% CI of 1.141 to 4.776 (P = 0.020). Low tumor grade (grade 1-2) oppositely reduced the mortality risk by 0.22 folds (95% CI, 0.065 to 0.763, P = 0.0168).

"""Glioblastoma Unique Features Drive the Ways for Innovative Therapies in the Trunk-branch Era.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a solid tumor with particular aspects due to its organ of origin and its development modalities. The brain is very sensitive to oxygen and glucose deprivation and it is the only organ that cannot be either transplanted or entirely removed. Furthermore, many clues and recent indirect experimental evidence indicate that the micro-infiltration of the whole brain parenchyma occurs in very early stages of tumor bulk growth or likely even before. As a consequence, the primary glioblastoma (IDH-wildtype, WHO 2016) is the only tumor where the malignant (i.e. distantly infiltrating the organ of origin) and deadly (i.e. leading cause to patient's death) phases coincide and overlap in one single phase of its natural history. To date, the prognosis of optimally treated glioblastoma patients remains dismal despite recent fundamental progress in neurosurgical techniques which are enabling better maximal safe resection and survival outcome. Intratumor variegated heterogeneity of glioblastoma bulk due to trunk-branch evolution and very early micro-infiltration and settlement of neoplastic cells in the entire brain parenchyma are the reasons for resistance to current therapeutic treatments.

"""Genetic profile of astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas.""","""Low-grade diffuse gliomas WHO grade II (diffuse astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) are characterized by frequent IDH1/2 mutations (>80%) that occur at a very early stage. In addition, the majority of diffuse astrocytomas (about 60%) carry TP53 mutations, which constitute a prognostic marker for shorter survival. Oligodendrogliomas show frequent loss at 1p/19q (about 70% of cases), which is associated with longer survival. With respect to clinical outcome, molecular classification on the basis of IDH1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, and 1p/19q loss showed a predictive power similar to histological classification. IDH1/2 mutations are frequent (>80%) in secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas with IDH1/2 mutations are very rare (<5%); they show an age distribution and genetic profile similar to secondary glioblastomas and are probably misclassified. Using the presence of IDH1/2 mutations as a diagnostic criterion, secondary glioblastomas account for approximately 10% of all glioblastomas. IDH1/2 mutations are the most significant predictor of favorable outcome of glioblastoma patients. The high frequency of IDH1/2 mutations in oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and secondary glioblastomas derived thereof suggests these tumors share a common progenitor cell population. The absence of this molecular marker in primary glioblastomas suggests a different cell of origin; both glioblastoma subtypes acquire a similar histological phenotype as a result of common genetic alterations, including the loss of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 10q.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21442241
"""CD133(+) and CD133(-) glioblastoma-derived cancer stem cells show differential growth characteristics and molecular profiles.""","""Although glioblastomas show the same histologic phenotype, biological hallmarks such as growth and differentiation properties vary considerably between individual cases. To investigate whether different subtypes of glioblastomas might originate from different cells of origin, we cultured tumor cells from 22 glioblastomas under medium conditions favoring the growth of neural and cancer stem cells (CSC). Secondary glioblastoma (n = 7)-derived cells did not show any growth in the medium used, suggesting the absence of neural stem cell-like tumor cells. In contrast, 11/15 primary glioblastomas contained a significant CD133(+) subpopulation that displayed neurosphere-like, nonadherent growth and asymmetrical cell divisions yielding cells expressing markers characteristic for all three neural lineages. Four of 15 cell lines derived from primary glioblastomas grew adherently in vitro and were driven by CD133(-) tumor cells that fulfilled stem cell criteria. Both subtypes were similarly tumorigenic in nude mice in vivo. Clinically, CD133(-) glioblastomas were characterized by a lower proliferation index, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was similar. GeneArray analysis revealed 117 genes to be differentially expressed by these two subtypes. Together, our data provide first evidence that CD133(+) CSC maintain only a subset of primary glioblastomas. The remainder stems from previously unknown CD133(-) tumor cells with apparent stem cell-like properties but distinct molecular profiles and growth characteristics in vitro and in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17483311
"""Treatment considerations for MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma.""","""Prognosis for patients with glioblastoma continues to be limited, despite an aggressive, multimodal treatment including alkylating chemotherapy. Temozolomide, the most widely used alkylating agent in glioblastoma, is cytotoxic to cells by inducing DNA damage but can be rapidly repaired by the protein O (6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In a subset of glioblastomas, the MGMT promoter is methylated, impairing the repair mechanism and conferring chemosensitivity. However, MGMT is overexpressed in 60 % of glioblastomas providing an inherent resistance to alkylating agents and challenging the role of temozolomide in this population. This article reviews the data establishing MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic factor in glioblastoma and its potential role as a predictor of temozolomide response. It focuses on results from recent studies in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and the role of temozolomide in MGMT-unmethylated patients. We then turn the discussion to alternatives to temozolomide for newly diagnosed patients as well as therapeutic options at the time of recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25394859

In addition, PROX1 has been ascribed suppressive as well as oncogenic roles in several human cancers, including brain tumors. In this study we explored the correlation between PROX1 expression and patient survival in high-grade astrocytomas. For this purpose, we analyzed protein expression in tissue microarrays of tumor samples stratified by patient age and IDH mutation status. We initially screened 86 unselected high-grade astrocytomas, followed by 174 IDH1-R132H1 immunonegative glioblastomas derived from patients aged 60 years and older enrolled in the Nordic phase III trial of elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Representing the younger population of glioblastomas, we studied 80 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas from patients aged 18-60 years. There was no correlation between PROX1 protein and survival for patients with primary glioblastomas included in these cohorts. In contrast, high expression of PROX1 protein predicted shorter survival in the group of patients with IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas. The prognostic impact of PROX1 in IDH-mutant 1p19q non-codeleted high-grade astrocytomas, as well as the negative findings in primary glioblastomas, was corroborated by gene expression data extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas. We conclude that PROX1 is a new prognostic biomarker for 1p19q non-codeleted high-grade astrocytomas that have progressed from pre-existing low-grade tumors and harbor IDH mutations.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27626492

However, despite the apparent advantages of the sRRV, improvements in the in vivo transduction efficiency are still required to deliver therapeutic genes efficiently for clinical use. In this study, we established a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelopepseudotyped semi-replication-competent retrovirus vector system (spRRV) which is composed of two transcomplementing replication-defective retroviral vectors termed MuLV-Gag-Pol and GaLV-Env. We found that the spRRV shows considerable improvement in efficiencies of gene transfer and spreading in both human glioblastoma cells and pre-established human glioblastoma mouse model compared with an sRRV system. When treated with ganciclovir after intratumoral injection of each vector system into pre-established U-87 MG glioblastomas, the group of mice injected with spRRV expressing the herpes simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene showed a survival rate of 100% for more than 150 days, but all control groups of mice (HSV1-tk/PBS-treated and GFP/GCV-treated groups) died within 45 days after tumor injection.

However, these approaches might not be easily applicable in routine clinical practice. In the current study, we aimed to establish a proteomics-based subclassification of GBM by integrating their genomic and epigenomic profiles. We subclassified 79 newly diagnosed GBM based on expression patterns determined by comprehensive immunohistochemical observation in combination with their DNA copy number and DNA methylation patterns. The clinical relevance of our classification was independently validated in TCGA datasets. Consensus clustering identified the four distinct GBM subtypes: Oligodendrocyte Precursor (OPC) type, Differentiated Oligodendrocyte (DOC) type, Astrocytic Mesenchymal (AsMes) type and Mixed type. The OPC type was characterized by highly positive scores of Olig2, PDGFRA, p16, p53 and synaptophysin. In contrast, the AsMes type was strongly associated with strong expressions of nestin, CD44 and podoplanin, with a high glial fibrillary acidic protein score. The median overall survival of OPC-type patients was significantly longer than that of the AsMes-type patients (19.9 vs 12.8 months). This finding was in agreement with the Oncomine analysis of TCGA datasets, which revealed that PDGFRA and Olig2 were favorable prognostic factors and podoplanin and CD44 were associated with a poor clinical outcome. This is the first study to establish a subclassification of GBM on the basis of immunohistochemical analysis.

Methods: Subjects were 212,513 workers ever employed in 1 of 8 manufacturing facilities from 1952 to 2001 and at risk from 1976 to 2004. We identified 722 cases of CNS neoplasms mainly by tracing through 19 state cancer registries. We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) based on CT state and national rates and modeled internal relative risks (RRs). Results: We found overall deficits in cases for glioblastoma (275 cases, SIR = 0.77, CI = 0.68-0.87) and most other histology categories examined. NH workers had a not statistically significant overall 8% excess in glioblastoma (43 cases, SIR = 1.08, CI = 0.78-1.46). Salaried NH workers had a statistically significant twofold risk of glioblastoma compared with hourly workers (17 cases, RR = 2.04, CI = 1.15-3.57). Other subgroups of NH workers revealed elevated but not statistically significant glioblastoma risks but little evidence of an association with duration of employment or time since first employment. Conclusions: Incidence rates for glioblastoma and other malignant CNS neoplasm histologies were not elevated in the total cohort. The glioblastoma excesses observed among NH workers may reflect external occupational factors, non-occupational factors or workplace factors unique to NH unmeasured in the current study.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20523076

As a member of the solute carrier family, ZIP9/SLC39A9 is overexpressed in prostate and breast cancer and affects B-cell receptor signaling. Here, we present data indicating that changes in intracellular zinc levels in glioblastoma cells can cause enhanced cell survival and cell migration, both hallmarks of the disease process. In particular, treatment of human glioblastoma cells with sublethal doses of cell-permeable heavy metal (Zn2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+) chelator (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN)) induced ZIP9 expression. Either TPEN treatment or expression of ZIP9 cDNA causes enhanced migration behavior of glioblastoma cells. Compared to untreated glioblastoma cells TPEN treatment or expression of ZIP9 results in activation of the tumor suppressor p53 by phosphorylation at serine residue 46 (Ser46) and in inactivation of the migration relevant glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) by phosphorylation at serine residue 9 (Ser9). Whilst p53 activation affects cell survival in response to TPEN, GSK-3β inactivation directly affects glioblastoma cell migration. Therefore, ZIP9 expression could regulate the migratory behavior of glioblastoma cells, so that ZIP9 may be of biological, but not of clinical relevance for glioblastomas, since in GBM tumor tissues, ZIP9 expression is not significantly increased compared to normal brain.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27654922

Searching for new markers of glioblastomas is of great significance for improving the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of glioma. Methods: Using the GEO public database, we combined 34 glioma microarray datasets containing 1893 glioma samples and conducted genetic data mining through statistical analysis, bioclustering, and pathway analysis. The results were validated in TCGA, CGGA, and internal cohorts. We further selected a gene for subsequent experiments and conducted cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses to verify the biological function of this gene. Results: Eight glioblastoma-specific differentially expressed genes were screened using GEO. In the TCGA and CGGA cohorts, patients with high CBX3, BARD1, EGFR, or IFRD1 expression had significantly shorter survival but patients with high GUCY1A3 or MOBP expression had significantly longer survival than patients with lower expression of these genes. After reviewing the literature, we selected the CBX3 gene for further experiments. We confirmed that CBX3 was overexpressed in glioblastoma by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays and qPCR analysis of surgical specimens. The functional assay results showed that silencing CBX3 arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, thereby weakening the cell proliferation ability.

We report 10 examples: 8 epithelioid glioblastomas (E-GBMs) and 2 rhabdoid GBMs (R-GBMs). E-GBMs tended to be superficially located, circumscribed, supratentorial tumors composed of monotonous, discohesive sheets of small rounded cells that mimicked metastatic malignant melanoma. R-GBMs showed tumor with classic rhabdoid features arising as a subpopulation of an otherwise classic GBM, fitting the definition of composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumors. Polyphenotypic immunohistochemical expression and focal loss of INI-1 protein in the rhabdoid areas of R-GBMs distinguished them from E-GBMs. Monosomy 22 was identified in R-GBMs, but not E-GBMs. Immunostaining for claudin-6, a key component of tight junctions that we have earlier shown to be a positive cytoplasmic immunohistochemical marker for atypical teratoid or rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), was also conducted. None of the E-GBMs or R-GBMs showed claudin-6 cytoplasmic expression, including the focal areas in the 2 R-GBMs in which there was loss of INI-1 protein nuclear expression.

Patients underwent surgical resection, and tumor samples underwent immunohistochemistry for IDH-1 R132H mutations. DT imaging data were coregistered to the anatomic magnetic resonance study and reconstructed to provide the anisotropic and isotropic components of the DT.

In a previous study we found an association between a low TIMP-1 tumor immunoreactivity and increased survival for glioblastoma patients, when compared to moderate and high TIMP-1 tumor immunoreactivity. The aim of the present study was to further evaluate TIMP-1 as a biomarker in gliomas by studying TIMP-1 gene copy numbers by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on 33 glioblastoma biopsies and by measuring levels of TIMP-1 in plasma obtained pre-operatively from 43 patients (31 gliomas including 21 glioblastomas) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed TIMP-1 gene copy numbers per cell ranging from 1 to 5 and the TIMP-1/CEN-X ratio ranging between 0.7 and 1.09, suggesting neither amplification nor loss of the TIMP-1 gene. The TIMP-1 protein levels measured in plasma were not significantly higher than TIMP-1 levels measured in healthy subjects. No correlation was identified between TIMP-1 tumor cell immunoreactivities and the TIMP-1 gene copy numbers or the plasma TIMP-1 levels. In conclusion, high immunohistochemical TIMP-1 protein levels in glioblastomas were not caused by TIMP-1 gene amplification and TIMP-1 in plasma was low and not directly related to tumor TIMP-1 immunoreactivity.

The level of MDM2 gene amplification (high versus low) may allow selection of patients for cancer treatment with MDM2 inhibitors and may predict their responsiveness. We investigated the spectrum of MDM2 gene alterations using the new probes in vivo after visualizing single neoplastic cells in situ from a series of glioblastomas. Signals from next-generation repeat-free FISH interphase probes were identified in tissue microarrays that included 3 spots for each of the 48 cases. The murine double minutes (MDM2)-specific DNA probe and the satellite enumeration probe for chromosome 12 were used. Three cases (6%) showed more than 25 signals (high gene amplification), and 7 (15%) showed 3-10 signals (gains); among these, 4 cases (8%) had an equal number of MDM2 and centromeric signals on chromosome 12 (polyploidy). Genomic heterogeneity was observed only in 3 cases with low gene amplification. In our series, 6% of glioblastomas exhibited high MDM2 amplification (in vivo) with a pattern related to the known double minutes/chromothripsis phenomenon (in situ), and only cases with low amplification showed genomic heterogeneity.

METHODS The authors describe their experience, in which SLA for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment was performed entirely within a conventional MRI suite using the SmartFrame stereotactic device. RESULTS All 10 patients with GBM (2 with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation [mIDH1] and 8 with wild-type IDH1 [wtIDH1]) were followed for > 6 months. One of these patients underwent 2 independent SLAs approximately 12 months apart. Biopsies were performed prior to SLA for all patients. There were no perioperative morbidities, wound infections, or unplanned 30-day readmissions. The average time for a 3-trajectory SLA (n = 3) was 436 ± 102 minutes; for a 2-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 321 ± 85 minutes; and for a single-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 254 ± 28 minutes. No tumor recurrence occurred within the blue isotherm line ablation zone, although 2 patients experienced recurrence immediately adjacent to the blue isotherm ablation line. Overall survival for the patient cohort averaged 356 days, with the 2 patients who had mIDH1 GBMs exhibiting the longest survival (811 and 654 days).

"""A 4-miRNA signature to predict survival in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers; however, recent advances in survival have increased the need for better prognostic markers. microRNAs (miRNAs) hold great prognostic potential being deregulated in glioblastomas and highly stable in stored tissue specimens. Moreover, miRNAs control multiple genes representing an additional level of gene regulation possibly more prognostically powerful than a single gene. The aim of the study was to identify a novel miRNA signature with the ability to separate patients into prognostic subgroups. Samples from 40 glioblastoma patients were included retrospectively; patients were comparable on all clinical aspects except overall survival enabling patients to be categorized as short-term or long-term survivors based on median survival. A miRNome screening was employed, and a prognostic profile was developed using leave-one-out cross-validation. We found that expression patterns of miRNAs; particularly the four miRNAs: hsa-miR-107_st, hsa-miR-548x_st, hsa-miR-3125_st and hsa-miR-331-3p_st could determine short- and long-term survival with a predicted accuracy of 78%. Heatmap dendrograms dichotomized glioblastomas into prognostic subgroups with a significant association to survival in univariate (HR 8.50; 95% CI 3.06-23.62; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (HR 9.84; 95% CI 2.93-33.06; p<0.001). Similar tendency was seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using a 2-miRNA signature of miR-107 and miR-331 (miR sum score), which were the only miRNAs available in TCGA. In TCGA, patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated tumors and low miR sum score had the shortest survival. Adjusting for age and MGMT status, low miR sum score was associated with a poorer prognosis (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97; p = 0.033). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis predicted the identified miRNAs to regulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation and survival.

"""p27Kip1 expression by contact inhibition as a prognostic index of human glioma.""","""The clinical manifestations of human glioma are known to be diverse, ranging from aggressive growth and invasion to apparent dormancy; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this diversity has been largely unexplored. In the present study, we characterized four human glioma cell lines, T98G, A172, U251, and NAC6, each of which has distinct growth properties. A172 and U251 cells continue to grow after confluency, whereas the growth of T98G and NAC6 cells is contact inhibited. Northern and western blot analyses revealed that at high cell density, the expression of p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was dramatically enhanced at both the RNA and the protein levels in T98G and NAC6 cells but not in A172 or U251. These facts together with the finding that overexpression of p27Kip1 caused G1 arrest in A172 and T98G cells suggest that the induction of p27Kip1 represents an important determinant of growth at high cell density. Immunohistochemical analyses of 42 primary gliomas revealed an inverse correlation between the level of p27 protein and the Ki-67 proliferative index. Kaplan-Meier plots demonstrated that a low level of p27 in tumors is associated with decreased overall survival. Thus, disrupted regulation of p27 expression at high cell density may play an important role in determining the clinical behavior of human gliomas as well as the prognosis for glioma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10737594

Results: Overexpression of CD151 was observed in a significant proportion (55.6%) of glioblastomas, while CD151 was rarely overexpressed in most of grade I to III glial tumors. CD151 overexpression was closely associated with MGMT methylation (P = 0.014), and it was a prognostic factor for predicting worse overall survival (OS; P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.043). We also found that combination of CD151 overexpression and MGMT methylation better stratified the patients' OS (P = 0.001) and PFS (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, CD151 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS over MGMT methylation (P = 0.012).

Propensity score-matched analysis was additionally performed to adjust for differences in baseline variables between molecular GBMs and histological GBMs. Results: Molecular GBM patients were substantially younger (58.1 vs. 62.4, P = 0.014) with higher rate of TERTp mutation (84.6% vs. 50.3%, P < 0.001) compared with histological GBM patients. Imaging showed higher incidence of gliomatosis cerebri pattern (32.7% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001) in molecular GBM compared with histological GBM, which resulted in lesser extent of resection (P < 0.001) in these patients. The survival was significantly better in molecular GBM compared to histological GBM (median OS 30.2 vs. 18.4 months, P = 0.001). The superior outcome was confirmed in propensity score analyses by matching histological GBM to molecular GBM (P < 0.001). Conclusion: There are distinct clinical, molecular, and imaging differences between molecular GBMs and histological GBMs. Our results suggest that molecular GBMs have a more favorable prognosis than histological GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39115615
"""Low expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in glioblastoma predicts longer patient survival.""","""In colorectal cancer and breast cancer a high TIMP-1 level has been shown to correlate with a shorter overall patient survival and it has been suggested that TIMP-1 is involved in tumour invasion, proliferation and apoptosis in different types of cancers. TIMP-1 is known to be expressed in gliomas but whether TIMP-1 is a prognostic marker in gliomas has not previously been investigated. In the present study, the TIMP-1 expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 112 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded astrocytomas and related to tumour grade and overall patient survival by scoring the TIMP-1 immunoreactivity of both tumour cells and blood vessels. Moreover, TIMP-1 in situ hybridisation was performed on ten of the glioblastomas. In the vast majority of the tumours TIMP-1 protein was expressed in both tumour cells and blood vessels. In situ hybridisation for TIMP-1 mRNA on glioblastomas confirmed the immunohistochemical expression of TIMP-1. The percentage of TIMP-1 positive tumour cells and blood vessels as well as the staining intensity varied between tumours of the same grade, but the total staining score increased with tumour grade. The multivariate Cox regression test showed that glioblastoma patients with the lowest TIMP-1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (HR (95% CI) = 3.2 (1.5-6.7), P = 0.004) when compared to the patients with higher TIMP-1 protein expression. In conclusion, this study showed that low TIMP-1 immunohistochemical expression predicts longer overall survival in glioblastoma patients, suggesting a role for TIMP-1 as a biomarker in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19430729

"""Evaluating the prognostic factors effective on the outcome of patients with glioblastoma multiformis: does maximal resection of the tumor lengthen the median survival?""","""Background: The ETR that should be undertaken in patients with GBM remains controversial. This study aims to reiterate some independent predicting factors and to underscore the role and the ETR in increasing the survival of patients in the situation of developing countries, that is, without preoperative MRI or tractography. The authors submit additional information to be added to the list of CTRs in the management of malignant brain tumors. Methods: The authors prospectively analyzed a cohort of 35 consecutive patients with histologically proven GBM who underwent tumor resection in surgically amenable areas for the first time at Sina Hospital, Tehran, between 2003 and 2005. Demographic data, volumetric measurements, and other characteristics identified on preoperative and immediate postoperative MR imaging as well as intraoperative and postoperative clinical data were collectively analyzed by SPSS for Windows, version 11.5 (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Results: Cox proportional hazards model multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors of survival: Karnofsky performance scale ≥80 (P = .01), ETR (P = .01), tumor location in functionally silent prefrontal area (P = .002) vs tumor location in corpus callosum (P = .001), postoperative RT (P = .004), and postoperative chemotherapy (P = .001) Conclusion: Maximal resection of the tumor volume is an independent variable associated with longer survival times in patient with GBM.

"""Chloride intracellular channel 1 activity is not required for glioblastoma development but its inhibition dictates glioma stem cell responsivity to novel biguanide derivatives.""","""Background: Chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) activity controls glioblastoma proliferation. Metformin exerts antitumor effects in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) inhibiting CLIC1 activity, but its low potency hampers its translation in clinical settings. Methods: We synthesized a small library of novel biguanide-based compounds that were tested as antiproliferative agents for GSCs derived from human glioblastomas, in vitro using 2D and 3D cultures and in vivo in the zebrafish model. Compounds were compared to metformin for both potency and efficacy in the inhibition of GSC proliferation in vitro (MTT, Trypan blue exclusion assays, and EdU labeling) and in vivo (zebrafish model), migration (Boyden chamber assay), invasiveness (Matrigel invasion assay), self-renewal (spherogenesis assay), and CLIC1 activity (electrophysiology recordings), as well as for the absence of off-target toxicity (effects on normal stem cells and toxicity for zebrafish and chick embryos). Results: We identified Q48 and Q54 as two novel CLIC1 blockers, characterized by higher antiproliferative potency than metformin in vitro, in both GSC 2D cultures and 3D spheroids. Q48 and Q54 also impaired GSC self-renewal, migration and invasion, and displayed low systemic in vivo toxicity. Q54 reduced in vivo proliferation of GSCs xenotransplanted in zebrafish hindbrain. Target specificity was confirmed by recombinant CLIC1 binding experiments using microscale thermophoresis approach. Finally, we characterized GSCs from GBMs spontaneously expressing low CLIC1 protein, demonstrating their ability to grow in vivo and to retain stem-like phenotype and functional features in vitro. In these GSCs, Q48 and Q54 displayed reduced potency and efficacy as antiproliferative agents as compared to high CLIC1-expressing tumors. However, in 3D cultures, metformin and Q48 (but not Q54) inhibited proliferation, which was dependent on the inhibition dihydrofolate reductase activity. Conclusions: These data highlight that, while CLIC1 is dispensable for the development of a subset of glioblastomas, it acts as a booster of proliferation in the majority of these tumors and its functional expression is required for biguanide antitumor class-effects. In particular, the biguanide-based derivatives Q48 and Q54, represent the leads to develop novel compounds endowed with better pharmacological profiles than metformin, to act as CLIC1-blockers for the treatment of CLIC1-expressing glioblastomas, in a precision medicine approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135603
"""Long-term survival with glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The median survival of glioblastoma patients is approximately 12 months. However, 3-5% of the patients survives for more than 3 years and are referred to as long-term survivors. The clinical and molecular factors that contribute to long-term survival are still unknown. To identify specific parameters that might be associated with this phenomenon, we performed a detailed clinical and molecular analysis of 55 primary glioblastoma long-term survivors recruited at the six clinical centres of the German Glioma Network and one associated centre. An evaluation form was developed and used to document demographic, clinical and treatment-associated parameters. In addition, environmental risk factors, associated diseases and occupational risks were assessed. These patients were characterized by young age at diagnosis and a good initial Karnofsky performance score (KPS). None of the evaluated socioeconomic, environmental and occupational factors were associated with long-term survival. Molecular analyses revealed MGMT hypermethylation in 28 of 36 tumours (74%) investigated. TP53 mutations were found in 9 of 31 tumours (29%) and EGFR amplification in 10 of 38 tumours (26%). Only 2 of 32 tumours (6%) carried combined 1p and 19q deletions. Comparison of these data with results from an independent series of 141 consecutive unselected glioblastoma patients registered in the German Glioma Network revealed significantly more frequent MGMT hypermethylation in the long-term survivor group. Taken together, our findings underline the association of glioblastoma long-term survival with prognostically favourable clinical factors, in particular young age and good initial performance score, as well as MGMT promoter hypermethylation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17785346
"""The relationship between genetic aberrations as detected by comparative genomic hybridization and vascularization in glioblastoma xenografts.""","""Angiogenesis is of vital importance for the growth of solid tumors and constitutes a target for anti-cancer therapy. Glioblastomas (GBMs) are histologically characterized by striking microvascular proliferation. The identification of the mechanism of angiogenesis is of major importance for the further development of anti-angiogenic therapy. Tumor angiogenesis might be the result of a combination of local tissue conditions (especially hypoxia) and specific genetic alterations acquired during oncogenesis. In order to investigate the relationship between genetic aberrations and tumor angiogenesis in GBM xenograft lines, the genetic alterations were examined by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). Two vascular phenotypes of GBM xenografts could be identified: a well vascularized and a poorly vascularized type. In this model, the poorly vascularized type had a larger number of genetic alterations. However, there was no unequivocal correlation between angiogenesis, growth rate and patterns of genetic alterations as detected by CGH.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11386408
"""Expression Profiling of Primary and Recurrent Glioblastomas Reveals a Reduced Level of Pentraxin 3 in Recurrent Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are highly infiltrative tumors and despite intensive treatment tumor recurrence is inevitable. The immune microenvironment in recurrent GBM is poorly characterized, but it is potentially influenced by therapeutic interventions with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to obtain a deeper insight in the immune microenvironment in primary and recurrent GBM. Primary and recurrent glioblastoma samples from 18 patients were identified and expression profiling of 770 myeloid innate immune-related markers was performed. Leukemia inhibitory factor and pentraxin 3 were expressed at lower levels in recurrent tumors. Using in silico data and immunohistochemical staining, this was validated for pentraxin 3. Both high leukemia inhibitory factor and pentraxin 3 expression appeared to be associated with shorter survival in primary and recurrent GBM using in silico data. In primary GBM, gene set analysis also showed higher expression of genes involved in metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and complement activation, whereas genes involved in T cell activation and checkpoint signaling were expressed at higher levels in recurrent GBM. The reduced level of pentraxin 3 in recurrent glioblastomas and the gene set analysis results suggest an altered microenvironment in recurrent GBM that might be more active.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791527
"""Expression of the oligodendroglial lineage-associated markers Olig1 and Olig2 in different types of human gliomas.""","""Because a specific group of oligodendrogliomas is susceptible to adjuvant therapy, it is important to elucidate the biological characteristics of these tumors. In situ hybridization analyses have revealed that Olig genes are expressed in oligodendroglial lineage cells and are highly expressed in oligodendrogliomas. To clarify whether OLIG is a tumor-specific marker for oligodendrogliomas, we have investigated the expression of Olig transcripts by semiquantitative RT-PCR assay and OLIG2 protein with a new antibody in a variety of glial tumors. The semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that high levels of expression of Olig1 and Olig2 mRNAs were present in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, while expression of these mRNAs in grade IV glioblastomas was lower than in grade II and grade III gliomas (p < 0.01). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the mean immunopositive proportion of OLIG2 was 82% in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas but only 34% in anaplastic astrocytomas. Therefore, although OLIG2 expression was detected in a range of gliomas not specific for oligodendrogliomas, the expression level in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas was more uniform and intense than that in other glial tumors. In conclusion, combining Olig mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry of OLIG2 enables oligodendrogliomas to be distinguished from glioblastomas and other astrocytic glial tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575240
"""Multimodal MRI can identify perfusion and metabolic changes in the invasive margin of glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To use perfusion and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy to compare the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-defined invasive and noninvasive regions. Invasion of normal brain is a cardinal feature of glioblastomas (GBM) and a major cause of treatment failure. DTI can identify invasive regions.

The DTI and DSCI data were coregistered to the spectroscopy data and regions of interest (ROIs) were made in the invasive (determined by DTI), noninvasive regions, and normal brain. Values of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), myoinositol (mI), total choline (Cho), and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) normalized to creatine (Cr) and Cho/NAA were measured at each ROI. Results: Invasive regions showed significant increases in rCBV, suggesting angiogenesis (invasive rCBV 1.64 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.5-1.76] vs. noninvasive 1.14 [1.09-1.18]; P < 0.001), Cho/Cr (invasive 0.42 [0.38-0.46] vs. noninvasive 0.35 [0.31-0.38]; P = 0.02) and Cho/NAA (invasive 0.54 [0.41-0.68] vs. noninvasive 0.37 [0.29-0.45]; P = < 0.03), suggesting proliferation, and Glx/Cr (invasive 1.54 [1.27-1.82] vs. noninvasive 1.3 [1.13-1.47]; P = 0.028), suggesting glutamate release; and a significantly reduced NAA/Cr (invasive 0.95 [0.85-1.05] vs. noninvasive 1.19 [1.06-1.31]; P = 0.008). The mI/Cr was not different between the three ROIs (invasive 1.2 [0.99-1.41] vs. noninvasive 1.3 [1.14-1.46]; P = 0.68). In the noninvasive regions, the values were not different from normal brain.

The aggressiveness of this cancer has been attributed in part to the persistence of treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem-like cells. We have previously discovered the tumor-suppressor properties of the microRNA cluster miR-302-367, representing a potential treatment for glioblastoma. Here, we attempted to develop a cell-based therapy by taking advantage of the capability of glioma cells to secrete exosomes that enclose small RNA molecules. We engineered primary glioma cells to stably express the miR-302-367. Remarkably, these cells altered, in a paracrine-dependent manner, the expression of stemness markers, the proliferation and the tumorigenicity of neighboring glioblastoma cells. Further characterization of the secretome derived from miR-302-367 expressing cells showed that a large amount of miR-302-367 was enclosed in exosomes, which were internalized by the neighboring glioblastoma cells. This miR-302-367 cell-to-cell transfer resulted in the inhibition of its targets such as CXCR4/SDF1, SHH, cyclin D, cyclin A and E2F1.

The investigation on the genes regulating leukocyte migration may help us to understand the mechanisms regulating immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment. Here, we collected the data from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze the expression of leukocyte migration related genes in glioblastoma (GBM). Lymphocyte specific protein 1 (LSP1) was identified as the only gene in this family which not only has an elevated expression, but also serve as an independent predictive factor for progressive malignancy in glioma. We further confirmed these results in clinical glioma samples by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. Moreover, LSP1 expression was closely related to the response to radio- and chemotherapy in GBM, and positively correlated with immunosuppressive cell populations, including M2 macrophages, neutrophil, and regulatory T cell. Additionally, elevated LSP-1 expression enhanced the expression of immunosuppression related genes like programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and leukocyte associated immunoglobulin like receptor 1 (LAIR1) in macrophages. LSP1 also promoted the migration of macrophages.

Herein, we show that expression of CypA in human glioblastoma cell lines and tissues is significantly higher than in normal human astrocytes and normal counterparts of brain tissue. To determine the role of over-expressed CypA in glioblastoma, stable RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of CypA (CypA KD) was performed in gliobastoma cell line U87vIII (U87MG · ΔEGFR). CypA KD stable single clones decrease proliferation, infiltration, migration, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and with slower growth in vivo as xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice. We have also observed that knockdown of CypA inhibits expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a tumorigenic and proangiogenic cytokine. Conversely, enforced expression of CypA in the CypA KD cell line, Ud-12, markedly enhanced IL-8 transcripts and restored Ud-12 proliferation, suggesting that CypA-mediated IL-8 production provides a growth advantage to glioblastoma cells. CypA knockdown-mediated inhibition of IL-8 is due to reduced activity of NF-κB, which is one of the major transcription factors regulating IL-8 expression.

"""A novel prognostic six-CpG signature in glioblastomas.""","""Aims: We aimed to identify a clinically useful biomarker using DNA methylation-based information to optimize individual treatment of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: A six-CpG panel was identified by incorporating genome-wide DNA methylation data and clinical information of three distinct discovery sets and was combined using a risk-score model. Different validation sets of GBMs and lower-grade gliomas and different statistical methods were implemented for prognostic evaluation. An integrative analysis of multidimensional TCGA data was performed to molecularly characterize different risk tumors. Results: The six-CpG risk-score signature robustly predicted overall survival (OS) in all discovery and validation cohorts and in a treatment-independent manner. It also predicted progression-free survival (PFS) in available patients. The multimarker epigenetic signature was demonstrated as an independent prognosticator and had better performance than known molecular indicators such as glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) and proneural subtype. The defined risk subgroups were molecularly distinct; high-risk tumors were biologically more aggressive with concordant activation of proangiogenic signaling at multimolecular levels. Accordingly, we observed better OS benefits of bevacizumab-contained therapy to high-risk patients in independent sets, supporting its implication in guiding usage of antiangiogenic therapy. Finally, the six-CpG signature refined the risk classification based on G-CIMP and MGMT methylation status. Conclusions: The novel six-CpG signature is a robust and independent prognostic indicator for GBMs and is of promising value to improve personalized management.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29350455

Studies evaluating the association between glioblastoma and occupational or SES factors have yielded inconsistent results. We evaluated the association between SES and glioblastoma risk using a large, population-based cancer registry dataset. Methods: Data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were used to evaluate the impact of SES on glioblastoma risk. SES was divided into quintiles on the basis of census tract of residence. Census tracts are small, geographically defined areas with relatively homogeneous population characteristics. Results: Higher SES was strongly associated with increased risk of glioblastoma (p < .001). Relative to persons living in census tracts of the lowest SES quintile, the highest SES quintile had a rate ratio of 1.45 (95 % CI 1.39-1.51) (p < .001). Similar associations were seen in population subgroups defined by age, sex, and race. Conclusions: The strong association between higher SES and greater glioblastoma risk is unlikely to represent an ascertainment effect because glioblastoma is rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal. A number of previously proposed glioma risk factors may be correlated with SES, including atopy and allergy rates, cellular telephone use, and body morphometric measures.

Here, we report that the compound NSC319726 binds copper to induce oxidative stress and arrest glioblastoma-patient-derived cells at picomolar concentrations. Pharmacogenomic analysis suggested that NSC319726 and 65 other structural analogs exhibit lethality through metal binding. Although NSC319726 has been reported to function as a zinc ionophore, we report here that this compound binds to copper to arrest cell growth. We generated and validated pharmacogenomic predictions: copper toxicity was substantially inhibited by hypoxia, through an hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α-dependent pathway; copper-bound NSC319726 induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of deoxyribosyl purines, resulting in cell-cycle arrest. These results suggest that metal-induced DNA damage may be a consequence of exposure to some xenobiotics, therapeutic agents, as well as other causes of copper dysregulation, and reveal a potent mechanism for targeting glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29576531
"""Association between socioeconomic status and survival in glioblastoma: An Italian single-centre prospective observational study.""","""Background: To date, no prospective study has been conducted to investigate the role of socioeconomic status (SES) on clinical outcome of glioblastoma (GBM) in Italy, where there is a National Health Service that provides universal coverage regardless of the patient's economic status. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study investigating the association between SES and survival in GBM patients at our institution, a hub centre for brain cancer research and treatment. We included GBM patients who underwent medical treatment or chemo-radiation between April 2017 and December 2017. The SES was measured using the income-brackets, attributed by the Italian Ministry of Finance on the basis of the income of the fiscal family unit, referring to the previous year. Results: One hundred and six patients were included in the study. In multivariate analysis, overall survival (OS) correlated significantly with higher-income (HR = 0.623.95% CI 0.467-0.832; p = 0.001) and MGMT methylation status (HR = 0.158.95% CI 0.082-0.304; P < 0.001). When adjusted for age, performance status and extension of surgery, survival benefit remained superior for higher-income HR = 0.641 (95% CI 0.478-0.858; p = 0.003) and MGMT methylated tumours HR = 0.167 (95% CI 0.084-0.331; p < 0.001). Conclusions: SES is an important determinant of prognosis in GBM even in the Italian National Health Service, which provides universal, largely free and relatively comprehensive healthcare.

We previously reported that Fas expression is predominantly induced in perinecrotic glioma cells, suggesting that Fas induction is associated with apoptosis and necrosis formation, a histological hallmark of glioblastomas. In this study, we assessed the expression of FasL in 10 glioblastoma cell lines and in 14 astrocytic brain tumors (three low-grade astrocytomas and 11 glioblastomas). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR revealed that all glioblastoma cell lines and primary astrocytic brain tumors express FasL. Immunohistochemically, FasL was predominantly expressed on the plasma membrane of glioma cells. These results suggest that FasL expression is common in human astrocytic brain tumors and may cause apoptosis of glioma cells if Fas expression is induced.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9217971

Although temozolomide chemotherapy has been shown to significantly improve survival in patients with GBM, this increase is only trivial. The underlying cause is that many GBMs do not respond to temozolomide, and the rest produces resistance. In the past two decades, many attempts have been made to understand resistance mechanisms and to combine other treatments with temozolomide to maximize patient benefit. Unfortunately, it seems to be a red queen game, and the speed of disease development is as fast as the progress in the field. In order to win this game, a comprehensive approach is needed to decipher the details of the resistance mechanism and to transfer the basic research to the clinic.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) demonstrate novel mechanisms of targeting the elusive CSCs with greater selectivity - promising therapeutic potential against solid tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) that are resistant to conventional treatment. In general, OVs have failed to translate the efficacy from bench to bedside. The success of OVs rely on the hypothesis that eliminating CSCs is key to preventing recurrence. However, newly emerging evidence of CSC plasticity challenge this hypothesis by proposing that the CSC pool can be regenerated from non-CSCs post-treatment. We review this evidence surrounding the CSC hypothesis to propose an original perspective on why several advanced OVs may be failing to reflect their true potential in clinical trials. We argue that preventing non-CSC to CSC dedifferentiation may be critical to achieving long-term treatment efficacy in future OV clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32744059
"""Ventricular entry during surgical resection is associated with intracranial leptomeningeal dissemination in glioblastoma patients.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is associated with a poorer prognosis when leptomeningeal dissemination (LMD) occurs. Recently, the role of both ventricular entry (VE) during surgery and subventricular zone localization of tumors in promoting LMD in GBM patients has been debated. This article investigates the role of VE in causing LMD in GBM patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of GBMs operated on at our Institution between March 2018 and December 2020. We collected pre- and post-surgical images, anamnestic information, and surgical reports. Results: Two hundred cases were collected. The GBM localization was periventricular in 69.5% of cases, and there was a VE during the surgical procedure in 51% of cases. The risk of post-surgical LMD in the case of VE was 16%. The rate of LMD was higher in the case of VE than not-VE (27.4% vs. 4%, p < 0.0001). The rate of LMD in periventricular GBM was 19% (p = 0.1131). Conclusion: According to our data, VE is an independent factor associated with a higher rate of post-surgical LMD, and the periventricular localization is not independently correlated to this negative outcome. Neurosurgeons should avoid VE when possible. The correct surgical strategy should be founded on balancing the need for maximal EOR and the risks associated with VE.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36273377

Methods: 329 patients (40 grade 4 astrocytomas and 289 glioblastomas) with histologic diagnosis was retrospectively collected from our local institution and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The volumes of interests (VOIs) were obtained from four multiparametric MRI sequences (T1WI, T1WI + C, T2WI, T2-FLAIR) using (1) manual segmentation of the non-enhanced tumor (nET), enhanced tumor (ET), and peritumoral edema (pTE), and (2) K-means clustering of four habitats (H1: high T1WI + C, high T2-FLAIR; (2) H2: high T1WI + C, low T2-FLAIR; (3) H3: low T1WI + C, high T2-FLAIR; and (4) H4: low T1WI + C, low T2-FLAIR). The optimal VOI and best MRI sequence combination were determined. The performance of the RFO model was evaluated using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the best signatures were identified. Results: The two best VOIs were manual VOI3 (putative peritumoral edema) and clustering H34 (low T1WI + C, high T2-FLAIR (H3) combined with low T1WI + C and low T2-FLAIR (H4)). Features fused from four MRI sequences ([Formula: see text]) outperformed those from either a single sequence or other sequence combinations. The RFO model that was trained using fused features [Formula: see text] achieved the AUPRC of 0.972 (VOI3) and 0.976 (H34) in the primary cohort (p = 0.905), and 0.971 (VOI3) and 0.974 (H34) in the testing cohort (p = 0.402).

Many functionally important mutations have been discovered, known as neutral passengers. IDH1/2, EZH2, and DNMT3A are the best known epigenetic modifiers in cancer. These mutations are important in determining disease prognosis such that the status of the MGMT gene is a direct target of chemotherapy. For these reasons, newly developed technologies are necessary to determine new candidate targets for targeted-therapy development in GBM.

"""Immune cell infiltrates in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.""","""Objective: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Its pathogenesis remains unknown. Like glioblastomas, AT/RTs contain brain cancer stem cells (CSCs) that suppress the immunity of patients and are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Considerable infiltration of immune cells, including macrophages/microglia, dendritic cells and T-cells, has been noted in glioblastomas, which correlates with poor prognosis. The present study examines the significance of infiltrating immune cells in four cases of AT/RT; including one associated with an autoimmune disease, Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Methods: Tumor tissues from four patients with AT/RT were analyzed and compared with those from four patients with glioblastomas. The frequency of immune cells, including CD68+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, was assessed by scoring for statistical analysis. Results: The infiltration of immune cells was identified in the case of AT/RT associated with HSP and three other cases of infratentorial AT/RTs. Moderate infiltration of CD68+ macrophages/microglia and CD4+ cells was noted in AT/RTs with no significant difference from that in glioblastomas (p > 0.05). However, the infiltration of CD8+ T-cells was significantly higher in AT/RTs than that in glioblastomas (p < 0.05); CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly lower in AT/RTs than that in glioblastomas (p < 0.05). In addition, eosinophils were found in all AT/RTs, but not in glioblastomas. Conclusions: These findings suggest an immune microenvironment of AT/RTs with more immune effectors than glioblastomas.

We discuss here some important features of glioma angiogenesis and we present molecules and factors and their possible functions and interactions that play a role in neovascularization.

Current treatment includes chemotherapy with temozolomide, which is ineffective against GBM, suggesting an urgent need to develop novel therapies. This study evaluated isoaaptamine and aaptamine in the GBM cell lines for cell viability; GBM 8401, U87 MG, U138 MG, and T98G. Our findings showed that isoaaptamine was more potent than its iso-form aaptamine in these four cell lines, and GBM 8401 was most sensitive to isoaaptamine. The study in GBM 8401 cells showed that apoptosis was induced by isoaaptamine with increased cleaved caspase 3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Moreover, isoaaptamine enhanced oxidative stress by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting mitochondrial and cellular superoxidase dismutases (SOD1&2), peroxidase and an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), and disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, the oxygen consumption rates and activities of mitochondrial complexes I-V were significantly reduced. Mitochondrial dynamics were prone to fission instead of fusion after isoaaptamine treatment, and ATP synthesis was ablated. Also, autophagy-related acidic organelle vesicles were formed, indicating autophagy was triggered. Overall, isoaaptamine-induced ROS overproduction in mitochondria could cause mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and autophagy in the GBM cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36753955
"""STAT3 Serine 727 Phosphorylation: A Relevant Target to Radiosensitize Human Glioblastoma.""","""Radiotherapy is an essential component of glioma standard treatment. Glioblastomas (GBM), however, display an important radioresistance leading to tumor recurrence. To improve patient prognosis, there is a need to radiosensitize GBM cells and to circumvent the mechanisms of resistance caused by interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment. STAT3 has been identified as a therapeutic target in glioma because of its involvement in mechanisms sustaining tumor escape to both standard treatment and immune control. Here, we studied the role of STAT3 activation on tyrosine 705 (Y705) and serine 727 (S727) in glioma radioresistance. This study explored STAT3 phosphorylation on Y705 (pSTAT3-Y705) and S727 (pSTAT3-S727) in glioma cell lines and in clinical samples. Radiosensitizing effect of STAT3 activation down-modulation by Gö6976 was explored. In a panel of 15 human glioma cell lines, we found that the level of pSTAT3-S727 was correlated to intrinsic radioresistance. Moreover, treating GBM cells with Gö6976 resulted in a highly significant radiosensitization associated to a concomitant pSTAT3-S727 down-modulation only in GBM cell lines that exhibited no or weak pSTAT3-Y705. We report the constitutive activation of STAT3-S727 in all GBM clinical samples.

As much evidence shows that antidepressants decrease cancer incidence and improve patients' quality of life, we therefore attempted to explore the potential for fluoxetine to be used to treat GBM and its possible underlying mechanism. The expression level of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) was determined using immunohistochemical staining and PCR analysis. The mechanism of fluoxetine-induced apoptosis of gliomas was elucidated. Computer modeling and a binding assay were conducted to investigate the interaction of fluoxetine with the AMPAR. The therapeutic effect of fluoxetine was evaluated using an animal model. We found that fluoxetine directly bound to AMPAR, thus inducing transmembrane Ca²⁺ influx. The rise in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺]i) causes mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload, thereby triggering apoptosis. AMPARs are excessively expressed in glioma tissues, suggesting that fluoxetine specifically executes glioma cells. Our in vivo study revealed that fluoxetine suppressed the growth of glioblastomas in brains of Nu/Nu mice, an effect similar to that produced by temozolomide. Our preclinical studies suggest fluoxetine, a commonly used antidepressant, might be selectively toxic to gliomas and could provide a new approach for managing this disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25671301
"""Fibrin deposition in primary and metastatic human brain tumours.""","""Extravascular, intratumoral fibrin deposition is frequently observed within and around neoplastic tissue and has been implicated in various aspects of tumour growth. This is the first report on the presence and distribution of fibrinogen/fibrin in primary (14 glioblastomas) and metastatic (nine samples of lung cancer origin) human brain tumours detected by immunofluorescent techniques. All tissue samples showed specific staining for fibrinogen/fibrin. In glioblastomas fibrin deposits could be detected within and around tumour foci, while in metastatic brain tumours the tumour cell nodules were surrounded by fibrin deposits localized almost exclusively in the connective tissue compartment of tumours. Double-labelling reactions for von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen/fibrin has revealed that fibrin deposition occurred throughout the tumour stroma independently of tumour vasculature. The overlapping reactions for fibrinogen/fibrin and factor XIII subunit A, as well as the urea-insolubility of the deposits indicate the crosslinked, highly stabilized nature of fibrin both within and around tumours. Staining with Ki M7 monoclonal antibody specific for phagocytosing macrophages showed these cells to be scattered in the nonnecrotic areas in glioblastomas and to be accumulated at the interface of tumorous parenchyma and connective tissue in both primary and metastatic tumours. The close association between fibrin deposition and macrophage accumulation strongly suggests the active participation of tumour associated macrophages in the formation of stabilized intratumoral fibrin network in human brain neoplasms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8874864

With positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18)F]fluorethyl-L-tyrosine (FET), tumor coverage can be optimized with the option of regional dose escalation in the area of viable tumor tissue. Methods and materials: In a prospective phase II study (January 2008 to December 2009), 22 patients (median age 55 years) received radiochemotherapy after surgery. The radiotherapy was performed as an MRI and FET-PET-based integrated-boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The prescribed dose was 72 and 60 Gy (single dose 2.4 and 2.0 Gy, respectively) for the FET-PET- and MR-based PTV-FET((72 Gy)) and PTV-MR((60 Gy)). FET-PET and MRI were performed routinely for follow-up. Quality of life and cognitive aspects were recorded by the EORTC-QLQ-C30/QLQ Brain20 and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), while the therapy-related toxicity was recorded using the CTC3.0 and RTOG scores. Results: Median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 14.8 and 7.8 months, respectively. All local relapses were detected at least partly within the 95% dose volume of PTV-MR((60 Gy)). No relevant radiotherapy-related side effects were observed (excepted alopecia). In 2 patients, a pseudoprogression was observed in the MRI. Tumor progression could be excluded by FET-PET and was confirmed in further MRI and FET-PET imaging. No significant changes were observed in MMSE scores and in the EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-Brain20 questionnaires. Conclusion: Our dose escalation concept with a total dose of 72 Gy, based on FET-PET, did not lead to a survival benefit.

The results demonstrated that DLGAP1-AS1 was higher in WHO IV glioma than in WHO II and WHO III gliomas, higher in WHO III glioma than in WHO II glioma samples, higher in IDH1 wildtype glioma than in IDH1-mutant glioma samples, and higher in 1p/19q noncodeletion glioma than in 1p/19q codeletion glioma samples. Moreover, we observed that higher expression levels of DLGAP1-AS1 were correlated to shorter OS time in both low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Next, we evaluated the function of DLGAP1-AS1 in GBM using in vivo experiments. The data revealed that DLGAP1-AS1 knockdown greatly hindered U87 cell and U251 cell proliferation. Using coexpression network analysis, we identified that ATG4A was a potential downstream target of DLGAP1-AS1. The further analysis showed that ATG4B was significantly upregulated and correlated to shorter OS time in gliomas using both the CGGA and TCGA databases.

Survival, emergency room visits and admissions to an acute care hospital were determined. Mean and median total health care costs were calculated. Risk factors for Emergency room visits and acute care hospital admissions were determined. Results: Median overall survival was 6 months. The majority of patients (68%) had at least one visit to the emergency department and 77% had at least one admission to acute care. The mean and median total costs (hospital, ambulatory, physician billing, other health care costs) per patient were $162,479.78 (CAN) and $125,511.00 (CAN), respectively. Treatment with radiation or treatment with radio-chemotherapy was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 2.31 (95% CI: 1.44-3.7; P=0.0005) and 2.19 (95% CI: 1.28-3.74; P=0.004), respectively for emergency department visits as compared to patients who were managed with comfort measures only. Patients with a baseline ECOG 0 had a RR of 1.71 (95% CI: 1.06-2.77; P=0.0289) and patients with baseline ECOG 1 had a RR of 1.49 (0.98-2.26; P=0.0623) for hospital admission as compared to patients with ECOG 4. Conclusions: A large proportion of elderly GB patients (particularly those with good baseline performance status who underwent active treatment) presented to the emergency department and had at least one admission to acute care.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28866896
"""Molecular characterization of long-term survivors of glioblastoma using genome- and transcriptome-wide profiling.""","""The prognosis of glioblastoma, the most malignant type of glioma, is still poor, with only a minority of patients showing long-term survival of more than three years after diagnosis. To elucidate the molecular aberrations in glioblastomas of long-term survivors, we performed genome- and/or transcriptome-wide molecular profiling of glioblastoma samples from 94 patients, including 28 long-term survivors with >36 months overall survival (OS), 20 short-term survivors with <12 months OS and 46 patients with intermediate OS. Integrative bioinformatic analyses were used to characterize molecular aberrations in the distinct survival groups considering established molecular markers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutations, and O(6) -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Patients with long-term survival were younger and more often had IDH1/2-mutant and MGMT-methylated tumors. Gene expression profiling revealed over-representation of a distinct (proneural-like) expression signature in long-term survivors that was linked to IDH1/2 mutation. However, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas from long-term survivors did not show distinct gene expression profiles and included proneural, classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma subtypes. Genomic imbalances also differed between IDH1/2-mutant and IDH1/2-wildtype tumors, but not between survival groups of IDH1/2-wildtype patients. Thus, our data support an important role for MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/2 mutation in glioblastoma long-term survival and corroborate the association of IDH1/2 mutation with distinct genomic and transcriptional profiles. Importantly, however, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas in our cohort of long-term survivors lacked distinctive DNA copy number changes and gene expression signatures, indicating that other factors might have been responsible for long survival in this particular subgroup of patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24615357
"""Old and New Systemic Immune-Inflammation Indexes Are Associated with Overall Survival of Glioblastoma Patients Treated with Radio-Chemotherapy.""","""Background. Systemic immunity and inflammation indexes (SI) derived from blood cells have gained increasing attention in clinical oncology as potential biomarkers that are associated with survival.

The primary endpoint was their overall survival. Results. A total of 77 patients, comprising 43 males and 34 females, with a median age of 64 years (age range 26-84), who were treated between October 2010 and July 2020, were included in the present analysis (approved by a local ethics committee). In the univariate Cox regression analysis, all the indexes except two showed a statistically significant impact on OS. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, neutrophil × platelet × leukocyte/(lymphocyte × monocyte) (NPW/LM) and neutrophil × platelet × monocyte/lymphocyte (NPM/L) maintained their statistically significant impact value.

"""Depatuxizumab Mafodotin (ABT-414)-induced Glioblastoma Cell Death Requires EGFR Overexpression, but not EGFR(Y1068) Phosphorylation.""","""Glioblastomas commonly (40%) exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification; half of these tumors carry the EGFRvIII deletion variant characterized by an in-frame deletion of exons 2-7, resulting in constitutive EGFR activation. Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors had only modest effects in glioblastoma, novel therapeutic agents targeting amplified EGFR or EGFRvIII continue to be developed.Depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) is an EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the mAb 806 and a toxic payload, monomethyl auristatin F. Because glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma-initiating cell models expressed too little EGFR in vitro to be ABT-414-sensitive, we generated glioma sublines overexpressing EGFR or EGFRvIII to explore determinants of ABT-414-induced cell death.Overexpression of EGFRvIII induces sensitization to ABT-414 more readily than overexpression of EGFR in vitro and in vivo Exposure to ABT-414 in vivo eliminated EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells, and recurrent tumors were devoid of EGFRvIII expression. There is no bystander killing of cells devoid of EGFR expression. Surprisingly, either exposure to EGF or to EGFR tyrosin kinase inhibitors reduce EGFR protein levels and are thus not strategies to promote ABT-414-induced cell killing. Furthermore, glioma cells overexpressing kinase-dead EGFR or EGFRvIII retain binding of mAb 806 and sensitivity to ABT-414, allowing to dissociate EGFR phosphorylation from the emergence of the 'active' EGFR conformation required for ABT-414 binding.The combination of EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugates with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors carries a high risk of failure. Promoting EGFR expression rather than phosphorylation should result in glioblastoma cell sensitization to ABT-414.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371586
"""Clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of cerebellar glioblastoma.""","""Cerebellar glioblastomas (GBMs) are rare, with neither their pathogenesis nor prognosis being completely understood. The present study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of cerebellar GBMs by comparison with supratentorial GBMs, focusing particularly on the pathogenesis. The clinical factors between cerebellar (n=10) and supratentorial (n=216) GBMs were compared. Additionally, p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels were investigated in six patients by immunostaining as well as the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) status of five patients by direct sequencing. Eight males and two females participated in the present study, the mean age at diagnosis was 56.6 years and the range 37-75 years. Four patients presented with hydrocephalus and one with brainstem involvement, and two patients were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1. Two patients had previously received radiotherapy, eight patients received postoperative radiotherapy and seven chemotherapy. The mean Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was lower in patients with cerebellar GBMs compared to those with supratentorial GBM; however, the survival times did not differ between the two groups. All of the cases of six cerebellar GBMs were p53‑positive and EGFR‑negative, as detected by immunostaining, consistent with secondary GBM. However, no IDH1 mutations were detected in any of the five cases of cerebellar GBMs analyzed, indicating that these tumors were not of the secondary type. The KPS score with cerebellar GBMs may be lower due to hydrocephalus, which was ameliorated by surgery but may have impacted the survival rate. It was confirmed that cerebellar GBMs were identical to supratentorial GBMs with respect to its clinical features, with the possible exception of the KPS score. The present study's genetic analyses indicated that cerebellar GBMs may develop via a pathway different from that of either primary or secondary GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25199771

To elucidate the frequency of IDH1 mutation and its clinical significance in Chinese patients with pGBM, one hundred eighteen pGBMs were assessed by pyro-sequencing for IDH1 mutation status, and the results were correlated with clinical characteristics and molecular pathological factors. IDH1 mutations were detected in 19/118 pGBM cases (16.1%). Younger age, methylated MGMT promoter, high expression of mutant P53 protein, low expression of Ki-67 or EGFR protein were significantly correlated with IDH1 mutation status. Most notably, we identified pGBM cases with IDH1 mutation were mainly involved in the frontal lobe when compared with those with wild-type IDH1. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant association between IDH1 mutation and a better clinical outcome (p = 0.026 for progression-free survival; p = 0.029 for overall survival). However, in our further multivariable regression analysis, the independent prognostic effect of IDH1 mutation is limited when considering age, preoperative KPS score, extent of resection, TMZ chemotherapy, and Ki-67 protein expression levels, which might narrow its prognostic power in Chinese population in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22291938
"""Differentiation between glioblastomas and brain metastases and regarding their primary site of malignancy using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI at 3T.""","""Background: Differentiation between glioblastoma and brain metastasis may be challenging in conventional contrast-enhanced MRI. Purpose: To investigate if perfusion-weighted MRI is able to differentiate glioblastoma from metastasis and, as a second aim was to see if it was possible in the latter group, to predict the primary site of neoplasm. Material and methods: Hundred and fourteen patients with newly discovered tumor lesion (76 metastases and 38 glioblastomas) underwent conventional contrast-enhanced MRI including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion sequence. The calculated relative cerebral blood volumes were analyzed in the solid tumor area, peritumoral area, area adjacent to peritumoral area, and normal appearing white matter in contralateral semioval center. The Student t-test was used to detect statistically significant differences in relative cerebral blood volume between glioblastomas and metastases in the aforementioned areas. Furthermore, the metastasis group was divided in four sub groups (lung-, breast-, melanoma-, and gastrointestinal origin) and using one-way ANOVA test. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the peritumoral edema was significantly higher in glioblastomas than in metastases (mean 3.2 ± 1.4 and mean 0.9 ± 0.7), respectively, (P < 0.0001). No significant differences in the solid tumor area or the area adjacent to edema were found, (P = 0.28 and 0.21 respectively). There were no significant differences among metastases in the four groups. Conclusion: It is possible to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases by measuring the CBV in the peritumoral edema. It is not possible to differentiate between brain metastases from different primaries (lung-, breast-, melanoma or gastrointestinal) using CBV-measurements in the solid tumor area, peritumoral edema or area adjacent to edema.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30389510

"""Putting Proteomics Into Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma.""","""In glioblastoma, the most aggressive brain cancer, a complex microenvironment of heterogeneity and immunosuppression, are considerable hurdles to classify the subtypes and promote treatment progression. Treatments for glioblastoma are similar to standard therapies for many other cancers and do not effectively prolong the survival of patients, due to the unique location and heterogeneous characteristics of glioblastoma. Immunotherapy has shown a promising effect for many other tumors, but its application for glioma still has some challenges. The recent breakthrough of high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) systems has allowed researchers to update their strategy for identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in a much shorter time with lesser effort. The protein maps can contribute to generating a complete map of regulatory systems to elucidate tumor mechanisms. In particular, newly developed unicellular proteomics could be used to determine the microenvironment and heterogeneity. In addition, a large scale of differentiated proteins provides more ways to precisely classify tumor subtypes and construct a larger library for biomarkers and biotargets, especially for immunotherapy. A series of advanced proteomic studies have been devoted to the different aspects of immunotherapy for glioma, including monoclonal antibodies, oncolytic viruses, dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.

"""GLUT3 upregulation promotes metabolic reprogramming associated with antiangiogenic therapy resistance.""","""Clinical trials revealed limited response duration of glioblastomas to VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab. Thriving in the devascularized microenvironment occurring after antiangiogenic therapy requires tumor cell adaptation to decreased glucose, with 50% less glucose identified in bevacizumab-treated xenografts. Compared with bevacizumab-responsive xenograft cells, resistant cells exhibited increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, 13C NMR pyruvate to lactate conversion, and survival in low glucose. Glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) was upregulated in bevacizumab-resistant versus sensitive xenografts and patient specimens in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Resistant versus sensitive cell mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation-selective conditions produced less ATP. Despite unchanged mitochondrial numbers, normoxic resistant cells had lower mitochondrial membrane potential than sensitive cells, confirming poorer mitochondrial health, but avoided the mitochondrial dysfunction of hypoxic sensitive cells. Thin-layer chromatography revealed increased triglycerides in bevacizumab-resistant versus sensitive xenografts, a change driven by mitochondrial stress. A glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor suppressing GLUT3 transcription caused greater cell death in bevacizumab-resistant than -responsive cells. Overexpressing GLUT3 in tumor cells recapitulated bevacizumab-resistant cell features: survival and proliferation in low glucose, increased glycolysis, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and rapid in vivo proliferation only slowed by bevacizumab to that of untreated bevacizumab-responsive tumors. Targeting GLUT3 or the increased glycolysis reliance in resistant tumors could unlock the potential of antiangiogenic treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28138554
"""Survival and Proliferation of Neural Progenitor-Derived Glioblastomas Under Hypoxic Stress is Controlled by a CXCL12/CXCR4 Autocrine-Positive Feedback Mechanism.""","""Purpose: One likely cause of treatment failure in glioblastoma is the persistence of glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) which are highly resistant to therapies currently employed. We found that CXCL12 has highest expression in glioma cells derived from neural progenitor cells (NPC). The development and molecular signature of NPC-derived glioblastomas were analyzed and the therapeutic effect of blocking CXCL12 was tested.Experimental Design: Tumors were induced by injecting DNA into the lateral ventricle of neonatal mice, using the Sleeping Beauty transposase method. Histology and expression of GSLC markers were analyzed during disease progression. Survival upon treatment with pharmacologic (plerixafor) or genetic inhibition of CXCR4 was analyzed. Primary neurospheres were generated and analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of proteins regulating survival and cell-cycle progression.Results: Tumors induced from NPCs display histologic features of human glioblastoma and express markers of GSLC. In vivo, inhibiting the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis results in increased survival of tumor-bearing animals. In vitro, CXCR4 blockade induces apoptosis and inhibits cell-cycle progression, downregulates molecules regulating survival and proliferation, and also blocks the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α and CXCL12. Exogenous administration of CXCL12 rescues the drug-induced decrease in proliferation.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis operates in glioblastoma cells under hypoxic stress via an autocrine-positive feedback mechanism, which promotes survival and cell-cycle progression. Our study brings new mechanistic insight and encourages further exploration of the use of drugs blocking CXCL12 as adjuvant agents to target hypoxia-induced glioblastoma progression, prevent resistance to treatment, and recurrence of the disease.

Although the rapid recurrence of glioblastomas after treatment is a major clinical challenge, the relationships between tumor growth and intracerebral spread remain poorly understood. We have identified the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (gene name: pyridoxal phosphatase, PDXP) as a glial tumor modifier. Monoallelic PDXP loss was frequent in four independent human astrocytic tumor cohorts and increased with tumor grade. We found that aberrant PDXP promoter methylation can be a mechanism leading to further chronophin downregulation in glioblastomas, which correlated with shorter glioblastoma patient survival. Moreover, we observed an inverse association between chronophin protein expression and cofilin phosphorylation levels in glioma tissue samples. Chronophin-deficient glioblastoma cells showed elevated cofilin phosphorylation, an increase in polymerized actin, a higher directionality of cell migration, and elevated in vitro invasiveness. Tumor growth of chronophin-depleted glioblastoma cells xenografted into the immunodeficient mouse brain was strongly impaired.

"""Divergent Roles of PI3K Isoforms in PTEN-Deficient Glioblastomas.""","""Loss of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K activity, is frequent in glioblastomas (GBMs). However, the role of the two major PI3K isoforms, p110α and p110β, in PTEN-deficient gliomagenesis remains unknown. We show that PTEN-deficient GBM largely depends on p110α for proliferation and p110β for migration. Genetic ablation of either isoform delays tumor progression in mice, but only ablating both isoforms completely blocks GBM driven by the concurrent ablation of Pten and p53. BKM120 (buparlisib) treatment only modestly prolongs survival in mice bearing intracranial Pten/p53 null tumors due to partial pathway inhibition. BKM120 extends the survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors in which p110β, but not p110α, has been genetically ablated in the Pten/p53 null glioma, indicating that BKM120 fails to inhibit p110β effectively.

However, it remains unclear whether lactate is metabolized by GBMs. Here, we demonstrated that lactate rescued patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GBM cells from nutrient-deprivation-mediated cell death. Transcriptome analysis, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq showed that lactate entertained a signature of oxidative energy metabolism. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that U-13C-lactate elicited substantial labeling of TCA-cycle metabolites, acetyl-CoA, and histone protein acetyl-residues in GBM cells. Lactate enhanced chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation in a manner dependent on oxidative energy metabolism and the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Utilizing orthotopic PDX models of GBM, a combined tracer experiment unraveled that lactate carbons were substantially labeling the TCA-cycle metabolites. Finally, pharmacological blockage of oxidative energy metabolism extended overall survival in two orthotopic PDX models in mice. These results establish lactate metabolism as a novel druggable pathway for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35948010
"""Isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations in gliomas.""","""Over the last decade, extraordinary progress has been made in elucidating the underlying genetic causes of gliomas. In 2008, our understanding of glioma genetics was revolutionized when mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) were identified in the vast majority of progressive gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBMs). IDH enzymes normally catalyze the decarboxylation of isocitrate to generate α-ketoglutarate (αKG), but recurrent mutations at Arg(132) of IDH1 and Arg(172) of IDH2 confer a neomorphic enzyme activity that catalyzes reduction of αKG into the putative oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutate (D2HG). D2HG inhibits αKG-dependent dioxygenases and is thought to create a cellular state permissive to malignant transformation by altering cellular epigenetics and blocking normal differentiation processes. Herein, we discuss the relevant literature on mechanistic studies of IDH1/2 mutations in gliomas, and we review the potential impact of IDH1/2 mutations on molecular classification and glioma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26188014

During the past decade, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors. Specific genetic defects have been identified that appear to be important for the development, as well as maintenance of the malignant characteristics that are associated with GBM. Some of these genetic aberrations appear to have prognostic significance. However, even more exciting in this era of molecularly targeted therapy are the clues these gene alterations provide for identifying signaling mechanisms responsible for carcinogenesis, and for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Cancer drug therapy is currently undergoing a major transition with an attempt to move from the use of cytotoxic drugs towards the use of tumor mechanism-based drugs. Advances such as the decoding of the human genome, combinatorial chemistry, and gene expression profiling have led to an increase in the rate at which new drugs are being developed.

"""CRABP-II- and FABP5-independent responsiveness of human glioblastoma cells to all-trans retinoic acid.""","""Glioblastomas respond differently to all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for unknown reasons. Because CRABP-II and FABP5 mediate RA intracellular signaling respectively and lead to distinct biological consequences, their expression patterns in different grades of astrocytomas and the glioblastoma cells lines LN18, LN428 and U251 were examined to identify potential correlations with RA sensitivities. The response of glioblastoma cells to RA, decitabine or the FABP5 competitive inhibitor, BMS309403, was analyzed. CRABP-II and FABP5 were expressed to varying degrees by the 84-astrocytoma cases examined. Treatment of LN428, U251 and LN18 cells with RA failed to suppress their growth; however, U251 proliferation was inhibited by decitabine. The combination of decitabine and RA suppressed the growth of all three cell lines and induced significant apoptosis of LN428 and U251 cells. Both CRABP-II and FABP5 were transcribed in the three cell lines but FABP5 proteins were undetectable in U251 cells. The ratio of CRABP-II to FABP5 was not altered after RA, decitabine or RA and decitabine treatment and the resistance of cells to RA was not reversed by BMS309403 treatment. In conclusion, CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns are neither related to the tumor grades nor correlated with RA sensitivity. Additional molecular factors may be present that determines the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to RA. Dicitabine may improve the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to RA, however, its underlying mechanism and its in vivo feasibility need to be investigated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797252
"""Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in paired human primary and recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Patients with highly malignant glioblastomas have a short median survival time mainly due to aggressive relapses after therapeutic treatment. Beside others, they achieve their progressive character via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, comprehensive investigations on EMT in paired primary-recurrent glioblastoma pairs are presently not available. Thus, in our present study we examined the expression profile of different EMT-markers in 17 matched primary and recurrent glioblastomas by qPCR and double-immunofluorescence stainings to identify EMT marker expressing cell types. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of temozolomide on EMT marker expression in vitro. In comparison to primary tumors, expression of β-catenin (p<0.05), Snail1 (p<0.05), Snail2/Slug (p<0.05), biglycan (p<0.05) and Twist1 (p<0.01) was downregulated in recurrence whereas L1CAM showed upregulation (p<0.05; qPCR). Expression of desmoplakin, vimentin, fibronectin and TGF-β1 with its receptors TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2 was almost unchanged. Comparing each individual pair, five different 'EMT groups' within our glioblastoma collective were identified according to the regulation of mRNA expression of GFAP, desmoplakin, Snail1, Snail2, Twist1 and vimentin. Additionally, double-stainings of EMT markers in combination with cell specific markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD11b, von Willebrand factor) revealed that EMT markers were expressed in a complex pattern with all three cellular types as possible sources. Temozolomide treatment significantly induced mRNA expression of nearly all investigated EMT markers in T98G glioma cells. Thus, EMT seems to be involved in glioma progression in a complex way requiring an individualized analysis, and is influenced by commonly used therapeutic options in glioma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25845427
"""Revisiting the role of p53 in primary and secondary glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) develops from astrocytes and is the most aggressive primary cancer in humans. Invading cells grow rapidly and form their own blood vessels making them difficult to surgically remove or treat. GBM may develop de novo (primary) or through progression from a low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary). Mutational inactivation of the p53 gene and presence of aberrant p53 expression are reported in GBM, suggesting that p53 has a role in tumor progression. This study of seven de novo GBM and four secondary GBM patients, indicated that nine out of eleven (82%) had overexpression of p53. Our histopathological analysis showed that the expression of p53 in three out of four (75%) secondary GBM was confined to the nucleus and the p53 positive cells were randomly distributed throughout the tumor. The expression of p53 in four out of seven (57%) de novo GBM was cytoplasmic, diffusive, and confined to the perivascular region of the tumor. In two (29%) de novo samples both nuclear as well as cytoplasmic staining that was not confined to the perivascular area was observed. The results suggest that cytoplasmic p53 may contribute to the formation and maintenance of de novo GBM by virtue of its control of the vasculature of tumors. Furthermore, cytoplasmic p53 may reflect an association of p53 with Cullin 7, PARC, or with the sequestering partner of p53, mortalin. These results underscore the significance of p53 in the tumorigenesis of de novo GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17214319

Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with histopathologically proven GBM from 2009 to 2018. Data regarding the clinical and radiological characteristics as well as surgical outcomes were collected from the institute's electronic database. Taking Indian demographics into account, the authors used the cutoff age of 60 years to define patients as elderly. Frailty was estimated using the 11-point modified frailty index (mFI-11). Patients were divided into three groups: robust, with an mFI score of 0; moderately frail, with an mFI score of 1 or 2; and severely frail, with an mFI score ≥ 3. A questionnaire-based survey was done to assess caregivers' perceptions about postdischarge care. Results: Of the 276 patients, there were 93 (33.7%) elderly patients and 183 (66.3%) young or middle-aged patients. The proportion of severely frail patients was significantly more in the elderly group (38.7%) than in the young or middle-aged group (28.4%) (p < 0.001). The authors performed univariate and multivariate analysis of associations of different short-term outcomes with age, sex, frailty, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. On the multivariate analysis, only frailty was found to be a significant predictor for in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and length of hospital and ICU stay (p < 0.001). On Cox regression analysis, the severely frail group was found to have a significantly lower overall survival rate compared with the moderately frail (p = 0.001) and robust groups (p < 0.001). With the increase in frailty, there was a concomitant increase in the requirement for readmissions (p = 0.003), postdischarge specialist care (p = 0.001), and help from extrafamilial sources (p < 0.001). Greater dissatisfaction with psychosocial and financial support among the caregivers of severely frail patients was seen as they found themselves ill-equipped to provide postdischarge care at home (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Frailty is a better predictor of poorer surgical outcomes than chronological age in terms of duration of hospital and ICU stay, postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality. It also adds to the psychosocial and financial burdens of the caregivers, making postdischarge care challenging.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33002866
"""Simultaneous alterations of retinoblastoma and p53 protein expression in astrocytic tumors.""","""The genetic alterations frequently involved in glial malignancies are in the tumor suppressor genes, Rb and p53. An altered Rb expression or p53 overexpression is thought to indicate defective tumor suppression and subsequently more aggressive tumors. Therefore, to assess the alterations in the conjoint expression of Rb and p53 proteins in formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections, 64 astrocytic tumors were studied (16 astrocytomas,7 gemistocytic astrocytomas, 19 anaplastic astrocytomas and 22 glioblastomas) using the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Fifty two cases (81.25%) were found to be positive for p53 protein. Seventeen of these showed aberrant heterogenous staining for pRb, of which 7 were glioblastomas. Only one case of astrocytoma showed aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb. Thus, of the 64 tumors, simultaneous aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb was seen in 21.9% of cases. This was more commonly observed among glioblastoma cases (7/22). No statistical difference was found between the survival rate of heterogenous pRb and p53 positivity in different grades of tumors. In glioblastomas, the survival rate appeared to be less in patients expressing heterogenous pRb, but this was not statistically significant. These results lead us to suspect that p53 and pRb pathways are inactivated, either through mutation or as part of the neoplastic process in astrocytic tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10079373
"""Elimination of Radiation-Induced Senescence in the Brain Tumor Microenvironment Attenuates Glioblastoma Recurrence.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are routinely treated with ionizing radiation (IR) but inevitably recur and develop therapy resistance. During treatment, the tissue surrounding tumors is also irradiated. IR potently induces senescence, and senescent stromal cells can promote the growth of neighboring tumor cells by secreting factors that create a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we carried out transcriptomic and tumorigenicity analyses in irradiated mouse brains to elucidate how radiotherapy-induced senescence of non-neoplastic brain cells promotes tumor growth. Following cranial irradiation, widespread senescence in the brain occurred, with the astrocytic population being particularly susceptible. Irradiated brains showed an altered transcriptomic profile characterized by upregulation of CDKN1A (p21), a key enforcer of senescence, and several SASP factors, including HGF, the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Met. Preirradiation of mouse brains increased Met-driven growth and invasiveness of orthotopically implanted glioma cells. Importantly, irradiated p21-/- mouse brains did not exhibit senescence and consequently failed to promote tumor growth. Senescent astrocytes secreted HGF to activate Met in glioma cells and to promote their migration and invasion in vitro, which could be blocked by HGF-neutralizing antibodies or the Met inhibitor crizotinib. Crizotinib also slowed the growth of glioma cells implanted in preirradiated brains. Treatment with the senolytic drug ABT-263 (navitoclax) selectively killed senescent astrocytes in vivo, significantly attenuating growth of glioma cells implanted in preirradiated brains. These results indicate that SASP factors in the irradiated tumor microenvironment drive GBM growth via RTK activation, underscoring the potential utility of adjuvant senolytic therapy for preventing GBM recurrence after radiotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers mechanisms by which radiotherapy can promote GBM recurrence by inducing senescence in non-neoplastic brain cells, suggesting that senolytic therapy can blunt recurrent GBM growth and aggressiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34580063

Here, we showed that US28 increased the malignancy of U251 glioblastoma cells by enhancing signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that stimulates oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma. US28 expression increased the abundance of the key components of the S1P signaling axis, including an enzyme that generates S1P [sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)], an S1P receptor [S1P receptor 1 (S1P1)], and S1P itself. Enhanced S1P signaling promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival by activating the kinases AKT and CHK1 and the transcriptional regulators cMYC and STAT3 and by increasing the abundance of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), driving several feed-forward signaling loops. Inhibition of S1P signaling abrogated the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of US28. US28 also activated the S1P signaling axis in HCMV-infected cells.

"""Incidence, clinicopathologic, and genetic characteristics of mismatch repair gene-mutated glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant gliomas of adults and recur, resulting in death, despite surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. There are a few reports on immunotherapy for the mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient GBMs with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). However, the clinicopathological and genetic features of the MMR genes altered in GBMs have not been elucidated yet. Methods: The authors analyzed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from 282 (276 primary and 6 recurrent) glioblastomas to evaluate the mutational status of six DNA repair-related genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, POLE, and POLD1. Tumors harboring somatic or germline mutations in one or more of these six genes were classified as an MMR gene-altered GBM. The clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of MMR gene-altered GBMs were compared to those of tumors without MMR gene alterations. Results: Sixty germline or somatic mutations were identified in 37 cases (35 primary and two recurrent) of GBM. The most frequently mutated genes were MSH6 and POLE. Single nucleotide variants were the most common, followed by frameshift deletions or insertions and approximately 60% of the mutations were germline mutations. Two patients who showed MSH2 (c.2038C > T) and MSH6 (c.1082G > A) mutations had familial colon cancer. The clinical findings were not different between the two groups. However, the presence of MGMT promoter methylation and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) values (> 20) were correlated with MMR gene alterations. Conclusion: Since MMR-related genes can be found even in primary glioblastoma and are correlated with high TMB and MGMT promoter methylation, MMR genes should be carefully analyzed in NGS study on glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33864561

This is mainly because most patients suffer recurrence after treatment that currently consists in maximal resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide. The recurrent tumor shows a more aggressive behavior due to a phenotypic shift toward the mesenchymal subtype. Proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) may represent for GBM the equivalent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated with other aggressive cancers. In this review we frame this process in the high degree of phenotypic inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of GBM, which exists in different subtypes, each one characterized by further phenotypic variability in its stem-cell compartment. Under the selective pressure of different treatment agents PMT is induced.

Immunohistochemistry against 78 GBM-associated proteins was performed. Expression levels of each protein for each patient were analyzed using an image analysis program and converted to H-score [summation of the intensity grade of staining (0-3) multiplied by the percentage of positive cells corresponding to each grade]. Based on H-score and hierarchical clustering methods, we divided the GBMs into two groups (n=19 and 37) that had significantly different survival lengths (p<0.05).

"""Gamma distribution model of diffusion MRI for evaluating the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status of glioblastomas.""","""Objective: To determine whether the γ distribution (GD) model of diffusion MRI is useful in the evaluation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status of glioblastomas. Methods: 12 patients with IDH-mutant glioblastomas and 54 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging using 13 b-values from 0 to 1000 s/mm2. The shape parameter (κ) and scale parameter (θ) were obtained with the GD model. Fractions of three different areas under the probability density function curve (f1, f2, f3) were defined as follows: f1, diffusion coefficient (D) < 1.0×10-3 mm2/s; f2, D > 1.0×10-3 and <3.0×10-3 mm2/s; f3, D > 3.0 × 10-3 mm2/s. The GD model-derived parameters measured in gadolinium-enhancing lesions were compared between the IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype groups. Receiver operating curve analyses were performed to assess the parameters' diagnostic performances. Results: The IDH-mutant group's f1 (0.474 ± 0.143) was significantly larger than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.347 ± 0.122, p = 0.0024). The IDH-mutant group's f2 (0.417 ± 0.131) was significantly smaller than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.504 ± 0.126, p = 0.036). The IDH-mutant group's f3 (0.109 ± 0.060) was significantly smaller than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.149 ± 0.063, p = 0.0466). The f1 showed the best diagnostic performance among the GD model-derived parameters with the area under the curve value of 0.753. Conclusion: The GD model could well describe the pathological features of IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and was useful in the differentiation of these tumors. Advances in knowledge: Diffusion MRI based on the γ distribution model could well describe the pathological features of IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and its use enabled the significant differentiation of these tumors. The γ distribution model may contribute to the non-invasive identification of the IDH mutation status based on histological viewpoint.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35138915
"""Characterization of glioblastomas in young adults.""","""Most adult glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs) present in patients 45-70 years old; tumors occurring at the extremes of the adult age spectrum are uncommon, and seldom studied. We hypothesized that young-adult GBMs would differ from elderly-adult and from pediatric GBMs. Cases were identified from years 1997 to 2005. Demographic and histological features, MIB-1 and TP53 immunohistochemical findings and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification status by fluorescence in situ hybridization were compiled and correlated with survival. Twenty-eight (74%) of our 38 young-adult GBM patients had primary de novo tumors, two of which occurred in patients with cancer syndromes. Two additional GBMs were radiation-induced and eight (21%) were secondary GBMs. Seven patients were identified as long-term (>3 years) survivors. Six of 38 cases manifested unusual morphological features, including three epithelioid GBMs, one rhabdoid GBM, one gliosarcoma and one small cell GBM containing abundant, refractile, eosinophilic inclusions. MIB-1 index emerged as the most important prognosticator of survival (P < 0.005). Although there was a trend between extent of necrosis, TP53 immunohistochemical expression, and EGFR amplification status and survival, none reached statistical significance. GBMs in young adults are a more inhomogeneous tumor group than GBMs occurring in older adult patients and show features that overlap with both pediatric and adult GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17107596
"""gamma-secretase inhibitor-I enhances radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cell lines by depleting CD133+ tumor cells.""","""Background and aims: Glioblastoma is a deadly primary brain tumor with great resistance to radiotherapy. To reverse its radioresistance is important for improving prognosis. Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) have been proven to have anti-tumor effects, yet the knowledge of their influences on glioblastomas is still limited. Methods: The cytotoxic effects of GSI-I (a tripeptide GSI) on glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 were assessed by MTT assay, and the low concentration that did not induce significant cell death was determined. The in vitro radiosensitization effects of this low concentration of GSI-I were evaluated by cell colony forming assays. The CD133+ cell fractions before and after radiation with or without treatment of GSI-I were analyzed by flow cytometry. Then CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), and the radiosensitization effects of GSI-I on the two cell subtypes were investigated separately. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of GSI-I on CD133+and CD133- glioblastoma cells were examined, respectively, and the expression of the Notch pathway components between the two cell subtypes were compared. In addition, the anti-tumor effects of GSI-I were confirmed by in vivo experiments. Results: GSI-I at a low concentration sensitized U87 and U251 cells to radiation by depletion of radioresistant CD133+ cells. CD133+ U87/U251 cells displayed preferential sensitivity to low concentrations of GSI-I, which may be related to the higher expression of the Notch signaling pathway in these cells. Conclusions: Combining GSI-I with radiotherapy may represent a promising strategy for treating radioresistant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21167391

This methodology may well help neuropathologists, who must determine the aggressiveness of astrocytic tumors on the basis of morphological criteria. The proposed methodology comprises two distinct steps, i.e. i) the production of descriptive quantitative variables (related to DNA ploidy level and morphonuclear aspects) by means of computer-assisted microscopy and ii) data analysis based on an artificial intelligence-related method, i.e. the decision tree approach. Three prognostic problems were considered on a series of 250 astrocytic tumors including 39 astrocytomas (AST), 47 anaplastic astrocytomas (ANA) and 164 glioblastomas (GBM) identified in accordance with the WHO classification. These three problems concern i) variations in the aggressiveness level of the high-grade tumors (ANA and GBM), ii) the detection of the aggressive as opposed to the less aggressive low-grade astrocytomas (AST), and iii) the detection of the aggressive as opposed to the less aggressive anaplastic astrocytomas (ANA). Our results show that the proposed computer-aided methodology improves conventional prognosis based on conventional morphologically-based classifications. In particular, this methodology enables some reference points to be established on the biological continuum according to the sequence AST-->ANA-->GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9458164
"""Variable efficiency of the thymidine kinase/ganciclovir system in human glioblastoma cell lines: implications for gene therapy.""","""The gene therapy strategy using the hsvl-thymidine kinase gene (TK) and ganciclovir (GCV) injections that has been used for treating human glioblastomas has not been as effective as expected after the first animal experiments. A better understanding of the different steps involved in this treatment, like gene transfer, gene expression, and sensitivity of the recipient cells, is needed. After proposing sensitivity criteria for the TK/GCV system and for the bystander effect, based on the levels of GCV that can be reached in vivo, we studied seven human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U118, U251, SNB19, SNB75, SF295, SF539) for their sensitivity to the TK/GCV system. We also studied their in vitro bystander effect and their in vitro transfectability using LipofectAMINE as a transfection enhancer. Among six human glioblastoma cell lines stably transfected with the TK gene, five were sensitive to TK/GCV, and two had a good in vitro bystander effect. The in vitro transfectability of the cell lines tested was low (< or = 1%) compared to that of an established animal cell line, C6 rat glioma, in which 20-30% of the cells can be transfected routinely. According to this in vitro analysis, most of the glioblastoma cell lines should be sensitive to the TK/GCV system, but there is an urgent need for agents to increase transfection efficiency.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9382960

Generally, physical examination and blood analysis are a part of basic psychiatric differential diagnostics, whereas more sophisticated procedures (for example, brain imaging) are applied only in cases with pathologic diagnostic findings. Our report challenges this approach by describing a case of glioblastoma multiforme presenting as postpartum depression without abnormalities in basic differential diagnostics. Case presentation: A 28-year-old white woman who had been in outpatient treatment for postpartum depression was taken to the psychiatric emergency room. The psychopathological assessment, however, showed mild disorientation and severe deficits of long-term memory. Moreover, she complained of stabbing, bilateral headaches, but results of her physical examination and blood analysis were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed, which showed a contrast-enhanced mass lesion in the left frontal lobe. The patient underwent urgent tumor resection, and histologic results revealed an IDH-mutant glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was discharged with a substantially improved psychopathology and without neurological deficits. Conclusions: This report adds to the evidence that postpartum depression may have organic causes in some cases, a fact that needs to be considered in the clinical setting. Atypical neurocognitive findings in a psychiatric interview may alone justify brain imaging, despite normal physical examination and blood analysis results.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30567605
"""Frequent gene amplification and overexpression of decoy receptor 3 in glioblastoma.""","""The decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) gene is amplified at high frequency in human lung, colon, and liver cancers. DcR3 has been demonstrated to produce a secreted member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that negatively regulates Fas-mediated apoptosis. In this study we examined DcR3 gene amplification, DcR3 mRNA expression, and DcR3 protein expression in 46 human astrocytic brain tumors by quantitative genomic PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The DcR3 gene amplification was detected in none of 6 (0%) low-grade astrocytomas, 1 of 16 (6%) anaplastic astrocytomas, and 6 of 24 ( 25%) glioblastomas. Six of 7 (86%) cases with gene amplification exhibited both mRNA overexpression and/or protein overexpression, suggesting that DcR3 mRNA and protein were expressed more abundantly in the cases with gene amplification. We thus concluded that high DcR3 mRNA expression and protein expression may be positively related to the gene amplification in astrocytic brain tumors, especially glioblastomas. Further, we speculated that the DcR3 gene amplification with overexpression may be responsible for malignant features in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15627206

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a combination of DTI and DSC can assist in the differentiation of glioblastomas, solitary brain metastases, and PCLs. Materials and methods: Twenty-six glioblastomas, 25 brain metastases, and 16 PCLs were retrospectively identified. DTI metrics, including FA, ADC, CL, CP, CS, and rCBV were measured from the enhancing, immediate peritumoral and distant peritumoral regions. A 2-level decision tree was designed, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used at each level to determine the best model for classification. Results: From the enhancing region, significantly elevated FA, CL, and CP and decreased CS values were observed in glioblastomas compared with brain metastases and PCLs (P < .001), whereas ADC, rCBV, and rCBV(max) values of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of PCLs (P < .01). The best model to distinguish glioblastomas from nonglioblastomas consisted of ADC, CS (or FA) from the enhancing region, and rCBV from the immediate peritumoral region, resulting in AUC = 0.938. The best predictor to differentiate PCLs from brain metastases comprised ADC from the enhancing region and CP from the immediate peritumoral region with AUC = 0.909.

"""Myoinositol to Total Choline Ratio in Glioblastomas as a Potential Prognostic Factor in Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.""","""Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type diffuse astrocytic tumors tend to be pathologically diagnosed as glioblastomas (GBMs). We previously reported that myoinositol to total choline (Ins/Cho) ratio in GBMs on magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was significantly lower than that in IDH-mutant gliomas. We then hypothesized that a low Ins/Cho ratio is a poor prognosis factor in patients with GBMs, IDH-wild-type. In the present study, we calculated the Ins/Cho ratios of patients with GBMs and investigated their progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to determine their utility as prognostic marker. We classified patients with GBMs harboring wild-type IDH (n = 27) into two groups based on the Ins/Cho ratio, and compared patient backgrounds, pathological findings, PFS, OS, and copy number aberrations between the high and low Ins/Cho groups. Patients with GBMs in the low Ins/Cho ratio group indicated shorter PFS (P = 0.021) and OS (P = 0.048) than those in the high Ins/Cho group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the Ins/Cho ratio was significantly correlated with PFS (hazard ratio 0.24, P = 0.028).

"""Histology-based expression profiling yields novel prognostic markers in human glioblastoma.""","""Although the prognosis for patients with glioblastoma is poor, survival is variable, with some patients surviving longer than others. For this reason, there has been longstanding interest in the identification of prognostic markers for glioblastoma. We hypothesized that specific histologic features known to correlate with malignancy most likely express molecules that are directly related to the aggressive behavior of these tumors. We further hypothesized that such molecules could be used as biomarkers to predict behavior in a manner that might add prognostic power to sole histologic observation of the feature. We reasoned that perinecrotic tumor cell palisading, which denotes the most aggressive forms of malignant gliomas, would be a striking histologic feature on which to test this hypothesis. We therefore used laser capture microdissection and oligonucleotide arrays to detect molecules differentially expressed in perinecrotic palisades. A set of RNAs (including POFUT2, PTDSR, PLOD2, ATF5, and HK2) that were differentially expressed in 3 initially studied, microdissected glioblastomas also provided prognostic information in an independent set of 28 glioblastomas that did not all have perinecrotic palisades.

Genomic DNAs from 118 glioblastomas were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Sanger sequencing was used to sequence the MGMT promoter region to detect SNPs. The results were correlated with MGMT status and patient survival. Rs1625649 was the only polymorphic SNP located at the MGMT promoter region in 37.5% of glioblastomas. Homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) was correlated with a higher MGMT methylation level and a lower protein expression, but the result was not statistically significant. In patients with MGMT methylated glioblastoma, cases with homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) were significantly associated with a lack of MGMT protein expression and a better progression-free survival (PFS) than the cases with wild type rs1625649 (CC genotype) or heterozygous rs1625649 (CA genotype).

Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with GBM (according to the 2021 World Health Organization Classification) treated at Mayo Clinic Florida between January 2018 and July 2022. Seizures were stratified into preoperative seizures (PRS) and postoperative seizures (POS, >7 days after surgery). Associations between patients' characteristics and overall survival with PRS and POS were assessed. Results: One hundred nineteen adults (mean =60.9 years), 49 (41.2 %) females, were identified. The rates of PRS and POS in the cohort were 35.3 % (n = 42) and 37.8 % (n = 45), respectively. Patients with PRS were younger (p = 0.035) and were likely to undergo intraoperative electrocorticography. The incidence of PRS (p = 0.049) and POS (p<0.001) was lower among patients with tumors located in the occipital location. PRS increased the risk of POS after adjusting for age and sex (RR: 2.59, CI = 1.44-4.65, p = 0.001). There was no association between PRS or POS and other patient-related factors, including several tumor molecular markers (TMMs) examined. PRS (p = 0.036), POS (p<0.001), and O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) promotor methylation status (p = 0.032) were associated with longer survival time. Conclusions: PRS and POS are associated with non-occipital tumor location and longer survival time in patients with GBM. While younger ages predicted PRS, PRS predicted POS.

"""Glioma stem cell maintenance: the role of the microenvironment.""","""Glioblastomas are highly lethal cancers for which conventional therapies provide only palliation. The cellular heterogeneity of glioblastomas is manifest in genetic and epigenetic variation with both stochastic and hierarchical models informing cellular phenotypes. At the apex of the hierarchy is a self-renewing, tumorigenic, cancer stem cell (CSC). The significance of CSCs is underscored by their resistance to cytotoxic therapies, invasive potential, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, targeting CSCs may offer therapeutic benefit and sensitize tumors to conventional treatment, demanding elucidation of CSC regulation. Attention has been paid to intrinsic cellular systems in CSCs, but recognition of extrinsic factors is evolving. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are enriched in functional niches--prominently the perivascular space and hypoxic regions. These niches provide instructive cues to maintain GSCs and induce cellular plasticity towards a stem-like phenotype. GSC-maintaining niches may therefore offer novel therapeutic targets but also signal additional complexity with perhaps different pools of GSCs governed by different molecular mechanisms that must be targeted for tumor control.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21827414

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 281 patients with IDH-wildtype GBM. T1CE imaging-based classification was performed, and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging was integrated to evaluate its prognostic estimation ability. Based on the relationship between the tumors and SVZ, patients were categorized into SVZ+ and SVZ- cohorts based on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging findings. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Patients were then categorized into three subgroups based on their combined classifications: group 1 (SVZ+ on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging), group 2 (SVZ- on T1CE but SVZ+ on T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging), and group 3 (SVZ- on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging). Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate differences in clinical and molecular factors as well as in prognoses. Results: The T1CE imaging-based classification failed to stratify OS between SVZ+ and SVZ- cohorts (16.0 vs 20.0 months, p = 0.36). Survival analysis revealed similar prognoses for patients in groups 1 and 2, and patients in group 2 exhibited worse OS compared with those in group 3 (19.0 vs 23.5 months, p = 0.024). Logistic regression identified lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (p = 0.011), tumor diameter (p = 0.002), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation (p = 0.003) to be associated with a higher incidence of group 2 GBMs. Additionally, T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging-based classification provided significant prognostic value (17.0 vs 23.5 months p = 0.021) and was found to be an independent prognostic factor in the Cox multivariate analysis (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.08-2.96; p = 0.024). Conclusions: This study underscores the limitations of T1CE imaging-based SVZ-associated classification in predicting prognosis for IDH-wildtype GBMs. The authors therefore propose an integrated approach that involves T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging that can provide improved prognostic ability. Notably, the presence of TERT promoter mutation was identified as a critical factor in nonenhancing tumor infiltration into the SVZ. Further validation through extensive cohort studies is recommended to confirm these findings.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941641

Therefore, we undertook this retrospective review to evaluate a large series of patients with glioblastoma treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center to estimate the incidence of LMD and assess the impact of a variety of treatment modalities. Analysis was performed on 595 patients with glioblastoma treated on clinical trials from 2006 to 2012. The diagnosis of LMD was made by imaging or positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology in 24 patients. An additional 12 patients with known LMD diagnosed during this same period were included to evaluate the impact of treatment on outcome for a total of 36 patients. LMD developed in 4.0 % (24/595 patients) of the clinical trial cohort. Median survival from glioblastoma diagnosis was 16.0 months. Estimated median time of glioblastoma diagnosis to LMD was 11.9 months. Median overall survival from the time of LMD diagnosis was 3.5 months. Patients treated for LMD with chemotherapy/targeted therapy and radiation had a significantly prolonged survival (7.7 months) compared to chemotherapy/targeted therapy alone, radiation alone or palliative care. LMD remains an uncommon event in patients with glioblastoma. Patients treated aggressively with chemotherapy/targeted therapy and radiation had the longest median survival following diagnosis of LMD. However, patients receiving chemotherapy/targeted therapy and radiation were younger and this may have influenced survival. Given the overall poor outcomes, improved therapeutic approaches are needed for glioblastoma patients with LMD.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25168214
"""Microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1, a novel target in glioblastoma.""","""Genetic heterogeneity is recognized as a major contributing factor of glioblastoma resistance to clinical treatment modalities and consequently low overall survival rates. This genetic diversity results in variations in protein expression, both intratumorally and between individual glioblastoma patients. In this regard, the spectraplakin protein, microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), was examined in glioblastoma. An expression analysis of MACF1 in various types of brain tumor tissue revealed that MACF1 was predominately present in grade III-IV astroctyomas and grade IV glioblastoma, but not in normal brain tissue, normal human astrocytes and lower grade brain tumors. Subsequent genetic inhibition experiments showed that suppression of MACF1 selectively inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration in cell lines established from patient derived xenograft mouse models and immortalized glioblastoma cell lines that were associated with downregulation of the Wnt-signaling mediators, Axin1 and β-catenin. Additionally, concomitant MACF1 silencing with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) used for the clinical treatment of glioblastomas cooperatively reduced the proliferative capacity of glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, the present study represents the first investigation on the functional role of MACF1 in tumor cell biology, as well as demonstrates its potential as a unique biomarker that can be targeted synergistically with TMZ as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach for the treatment of genetically multifarious glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27959385

"""1p36 is a preferential target of chromosome 1 deletions in astrocytic tumours and homozygously deleted in a subset of glioblastomas.""","""Astrocytic, oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas are the commonest gliomas in adults. They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P=0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However, the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87% of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of glioma cell lines. Akt3 amplifications were found in four glioblastomas. Our results indicate that 1p deletions are common anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas but are distinct from the 1p abnormalities in oligodendrogliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17934521
"""The Prognostic Role of Peritumoral Edema in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Retrospective Analysis.""","""Objective: Previous studies on glioblastomas (GBMs) have not reached a consensus on peritumoral edema (PTE)'s influence on survival. This study evaluated the PTE index's prognostic role in newly diagnosed GBMs using a well-designed method. Methods: Selected patients were reviewed after a rigorous screening process. Their general information was obtained from electronic medical records. The imaging metrics (MTD, TTM, TTE) representing tumor diameter, laterality, and PTE extent were obtained by manual measurement in Syngo FastView software. The PTE index was a ratio of TTE to MTD. Multiple variables were evaluated using analysis of variance and Cox regression model. Results: Of 143 patients, 62 were included in this study. MGMT promoter methylation and tumor laterality were both independent prognostic factors (p = 0.020, 0.042; HR = 0.272, 2.630). The lateral tumors' index was higher than that of the medial tumors (57.7% vs. 42.6%, p = 0.027). Low-index tumors were located in relatively medial positions compared with high-index tumors (TTM, 4.9 vs. 12.8, p = 0.032). This finding indicated that the PTE index tended to increase with tumor laterality. Moreover, the patients with low-index tumors had a significant survival disadvantage in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.023, 0.220). However, further analysis found that the combination of tumor laterality and PTE statistically stratified the survival outcome. The patients with lateral high-index tumors survived significantly longer (p = 0.022, HR = 1.927). Conclusions: In contrast with the previous studies, this study recommends combining PTE and tumor laterality for survival stratification in newly diagnosed GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119276
"""Novel vaccines for glioblastoma: clinical update and perspective.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain cancer. Aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy provides limited overall survival benefit. Glioblastomas have a formidable tumor microenvironment that is hostile to immunological effector cells and these cancers produce profound systemic immunosuppression. However, surgical resection of these tumors creates conditions that favor the use of immunotherapeutic strategies. Therefore, extensive surgical resection, when feasible, will remain part of the equation to provide an environment in which active specific immunotherapy has the greatest chance of working. Toward that end, a number of vaccination protocols are under investigation. Vaccines studied to date have produced cellular and humoral antitumor responses, but unequivocal clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated. In addition, focus is shifting toward the prospect of therapies involving vaccines in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents so that effector cells remain active against their targets systemically and within the tumor microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993092

Based upon gene expression profile, researchers have classified glioblastomas into several subtypes. Genetic mutations provide an advanced standard platform essential for diagnosis, therapeutic remedies and prognosis of glioblastomas. Common mutations observed in glioblastomas are loss of heterozygosity at 10q followed by epidermal growth factor receptor amplification (34%) and others.

"""Depatuxizumab mafodotin in EGFR-amplified newly diagnosed glioblastoma: A phase III randomized clinical trial.""","""Background: Approximately 50% of newly diagnosed glioblastomas (GBMs) harbor epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification (EGFR-amp). Preclinical and early-phase clinical data suggested efficacy of depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m), an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a monoclonal antibody that binds activated EGFR (overexpressed wild-type and EGFRvIII-mutant) linked to a microtubule-inhibitor toxin in EGFR-amp GBMs. Methods: In this phase III trial, adults with centrally confirmed, EGFR-amp newly diagnosed GBM were randomized 1:1 to radiotherapy, temozolomide, and depatux-m/placebo. Corneal epitheliopathy was treated with a combination of protocol-specified prophylactic and supportive measures. There was 85% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) ≤0.75 for overall survival (OS) at a 2.5% 1-sided significance level (ie traditional two-sided p ≤ 0.05) by log-rank testing. Results: There were 639 randomized patients (median age 60, range 22-84; 62% men). Prespecified interim analysis found no improvement in OS for depatux-m over placebo (median 18.9 vs. 18.7 months, HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82-1.26, 1-sided p = 0.63). Progression-free survival was longer for depatux-m than placebo (median 8.0 vs. 6.3 months; HR 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.01, p = 0.029), particularly among those with EGFRvIII-mutant (median 8.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.93, 1-sided p = 0.002) or MGMT unmethylated (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97; 1-sided p = 0.012) tumors but without an OS improvement. Corneal epitheliopathy occurred in 94% of depatux-m-treated patients (61% grade 3-4), causing 12% to discontinue.

"""Racial and socioeconomic disparities differentially affect overall and cause-specific survival in glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: The prognostic role of racial and socioeconomic factors in patients with glioblastoma is controversially debated. We aimed to evaluate how these factors may affect survival outcomes in an overall and cause-specific manner using large, national cancer registry cohort data in the temozolomide chemoradiation era. Methods: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2005 and 2016. Overall survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models using disease intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Cause-specific mortality was assessed using cumulative incidence curves and modeled using multivariate cumulative risk regression. Results: A total of 28,952 patients met the prespecified inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. The following factors were associated with all-cause mortality: age, calendar year of diagnosis, sex, treatment receipt, tumor size, tumor location, extent of resection, median household income, and race. Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanic Whites had lower mortality compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Cause-specific mortality was associated with both racial and socioeconomic groups. After adjusting for treatment and tumor-related factors, Asian/Pacific and black patients had lower glioblastoma-specific mortality. However, lower median household income and black race were associated with significantly higher non-glioblastoma mortality. Conclusions: Despite the aggressive nature of glioblastoma, racial and socioeconomic factors influence glioblastoma-specific and non-glioblastoma associated mortality. Our study shows that patient race has an impact on glioblastoma-associated mortality independently of tumor and treatment related factors. Importantly, socioeconomic and racial differences largely contribute to non-glioblastoma mortality, including death from other cancers, cardio- and cerebrovascular events.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32617722
"""Heat-shock protein vaccines as active immunotherapy against human gliomas.""","""Modern advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to the development of active immunotherapy that utilizes tumor-associated antigens to induce a specific immune response against the tumor. Current methods of immunotherapy implementation are based on the principle that tumor-associated antigens are capable of being processed by antigen-presenting cells and inducing an activated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-specific immune response that targets the tumor cells. Antigen internalization and processing by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, or macrophages results in their surface association with MHC class I molecules, which can be recognized by an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte adaptive immune response. With the aim of augmenting current immunotherapeutic modalities, much effort has been directed towards enhancing antigen-presenting cell activation and optimizing the processing of tumor-associated antigens and major histocompatibility molecules. The goal of these immunotherapy modifications is to ultimately improve the adaptive specific immune response in killing of tumor cells while sparing normal tissues. Immunotherapy has been actively studied and applied in glioblastomas. Preclinical animal models have shown the feasibility of an active immunotherapy approach through the utilization of tumor vaccines, and recently several clinical studies have also been initiated. Recently, endogenous heat-shock proteins have been implicated in the mediation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses. They are now being investigated as a potential modality and adjuvant to immunotherapy, and they represent a promising novel treatment for human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19895242
"""Analysis of the functional role of chromosome 10 loss in human glioblastomas.""","""Molecular and cytogenetic analyses of primary brain tumors have shown that losses on chromosome 10 occur very frequently in human glioblastoma multiforme suggesting the presence of a glioma-associated tumor suppressor gene on this chromosome. To examine this hypothesis, a copy of chromosome 10 derived from a human fibroblast cell line was introduced into the human glioma cell line U251 by microcell-mediated chromosomal transfer. A human chromosome 2 was also independently introduced into U251 cells. The presence of novel chromosomes or chromosomal fragments was confirmed by molecular and karyotypic analyses. The hybrid clones containing a transferred chromosome 10 exhibited a suppression of their transformed and tumorigenic phenotype in vivo and in vitro, whereas cells containing a transferred chromosome 2 failed to alter their phenotype. The hybrid cells containing a transferred chromosome 10 displayed a significant decrease in their saturation density and an altered cellular morphology at high cell density but only a slight decrease in their exponential growth rate. A dramatic decrease was observed in the ability of cells with an introduced chromosome 10 to grow in soft agarose. The introduction of chromosome 10 completely suppressed tumor formation when the hybrid cells were injected into nude mice. These findings indicate that chromosome 10 harbors a tumor suppressor gene that is directly involved in glioma oncogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8104691
"""Predictive and prognostic factors for gliomas.""","""Despite recent therapeutic advances, gliomas, in particular the most frequent and malignant glioblastoma, remain devastating tumors and need a better molecular characterization to improve both classification and treatment. Currently, three molecular markers, related to better outcome, are particularly useful and complement the histological classification: the 1p/19q codeletion strongly predicts prolonged response to treatment and prolonged survival in oligodendroglial tumors; the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation, which is hypothesized to render the cell more vulnerable to alkylants, is associated with a stronger benefit of concomitant chemoradiotherapy in glioblastomas; mutations of the IDH1 (more rarely IDH2) gene affects 40% of gliomas (but 100% of the 1p/19q codeleted gliomas) and is inversely correlated to grade. IDH1 mutation is a strong and independent predictor of survival, whatever grade considered. The consequences of IDH1/IDH2 mutation (that results in a new enzymatic activity transforming alphacetoglutarate into 2-hydroxyglutarate) are currently under investigation. Recently, integrated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic studies have unraveled new glioblastoma subgroups that further refines the molecular classification of these tumors.

"""Additional genetic alterations in BRAF-mutant gliomas correlate with histologic diagnoses.""","""Introduction: Recently, the term 'Diffuse glioma, BRAF V600E-mutant' has been recommended for IDH-wildtype gliomas with BRAF p.V600E mutation and without CDKN2A/B deletion. However, additional alterations in gliomas that coexist with BRAF-mutations are poorly defined. Methods: We analyzed next-generation sequencing results in 315 cancer-associated genes for 372 gliomas from our institution (2010 to 2017). In addition, we reviewed IDH-WT gliomas with mutation and copy-number alterations available in cBioPortal, to further characterize BRAF-mutant gliomas. Results: Seventeen (4.6%) showed BRAF mutations. Tumor types included 8 glioblastomas, 2 epithelioid glioblastomas (E-GBM), 2 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA), 1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 1 diffuse astrocytoma, and 3 pilocytic astrocytomas. Fifty-three percent (53%) of cases exhibited BRAF-alterations other than p.V600E. The majority of the tumors were localized in the temporal lobe (52.9%). In addition to BRAF mutations, glioblastomas showed concomitant mutations in TP53 (3/8), CDKN2A/B-loss (6/8), TERT-promoter (6/8), and/or PTEN (5/8). Both E-GBMs and PXAs showed CDKN2A/B-loss and BRAF p.V600E with absence of TERTp, TP53, and PTEN mutations. Similar findings were observed in BRAF-mutant infiltrating gliomas from cBioPortal. Conclusions: Knowledge of additional alterations that co-occur with BRAF-mutations in gliomas may improve diagnosis and help identify patients that could benefit from targeted therapies. Furthermore, we provide examples of two patients whose tumors responded to BRAF pathway inhibitors, arguing in favor of these therapies in patients with BRAF-mutant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33009979
"""Comparative molecular genetic profiles of anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas multiforme and their subsequent recurrences.""","""Malignant glial tumors (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme) arise mostly either from the progression of low grade precursor lesions or rapidly in a de novo fashion and contain distinct genetic alterations. There is, however, a third subset of malignant gliomas in which genetic lesions remain to be identified. Following surgical resection, all gliomas appear to have an inherent tendency to recur. Comparative molecular analysis of ten primary malignant gliomas (three anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas multiforme) with their recurrences identified two distinct subgroups of recurrent tumors. In one group, primary tumors harbored genetic aberrations frequently associated with linear progression or de novo formation pathways of glial tumorigenesis and maintained their genetic profiles upon recurrence. In the other subset with no detectable known genetic mutations at first presentation, the recurrent tumors sustained specific abnormalities associated with pathways of linear progression or de novo formation. These included loss of genes on chromosomes 17 and 10, mutations in the p53 gene, homozygous deletion of the DMBTA1 and p16 and/ or p15 genes and amplification and/or overexpression of CDK4 and alpha form of the PDGF receptor. Recurrent tumors from both groups also displayed an abnormal expression profile of the metalloproteinase, gel A, and its inhibitor, TIMP-2, consistent with their highly invasive behavior. Delineation of the molecular differences between malignant glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences may have important implications for the development of rational clinical approaches for this neoplasm that remains refractory to existing therapeutic modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10022821
"""Prognostic factors in glioblastoma multiforme. 10 years experience of a single institution.""","""Background: To analyze prognostic factors in patients with a glioblastoma multiforme treated in an academic institute over the last 10 years. Patients and method: From 1988 to 1998, 198 patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme were analyzed. Five radiation schedules were used mainly based on pretreatment selection criteria: 1. 60 Gy in 30 fractions followed by an interstitial iridium-192 (Ir-192) boost for selected patients with a good performance and a small circumscribed tumor, 2. 66 Gy in 33 fractions for good performance patients, 3. 40 Gy in eight fractions or 4. 28 Gy in four fractions for poor prognostic patients and 5. no irradiation. Results: Median survival was 16 months, 7 months, 5.6 months, 6.6 months and 1.8 months for the groups treated with Ir-192, 66 Gy, 40 Gy, 28 Gy and the group without treatment, respectively. No significant improvement in survival was encountered over the last 10 years. At multivariate analysis patients treated with a hypofractionated scheme showed a similar survival probability and duration of palliative effect compared to the conventionally fractionated group. The poor prognostic groups receiving radiotherapy had a highly significant better survival compared to the no-treatment group. Patients treated with an Ir-192 boost had a better median survival compared to a historical group matched on selection criteria but without boost treatment (16 vs 9.7 months, n.s.). However, survival at 2 years was similar. Analysis on pretreatment characteristics at multivariate analysis revealed age, neurological performance, addition of radiotherapy, total resection, tumor size post surgery and deterioration before start of radiotherapy (borderline) as significant prognostic factors for survival. Conclusion: Despite technical developments in surgery and radiotherapy over the last 10 years, survival of patients with a glioblastoma multiforme has not improved in our institution. The analysis of prognostic factors corresponded well with data from the literature. A short hypofractionated scheme seems to be a more appropriate treatment for patients with intermediate or poor prognosis as compared to a conventional scheme. The benefit in median survival for patients treated with an interstitial boost is partly explained by patient selection. Since there were no long-term survivors with this boost treatment, its clinical value, if there is one, is still limited.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11446316

Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to predict the risk score of each patient. Validations of the hub gene were completed in other databases. Results: Functional analysis of the DEGs verified the involvement of DEGs in growth factor binding and gated channel activity. Among the 10 GBM-related modules, the red one displayed the strongest tie with GBM. VAMP2 was filtered out as the most intimate protein. The PPI network and TCGA were comprehensively analyzed.

These subtypes of glioblastoma constitute distinct disease entities that evolve through different genetic pathways, affect patients at different ages, and are likely to differ in prognosis and response to therapy. Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show EGFR overexpression, PTEN (MMAC1) mutations, CDKN2A (p16) deletions, and less frequently, MDM2 amplification. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and often contain TP53 mutations as the earliest detectable alteration. These characteristics are derived largely from patients selected on the basis of clinical history and sequential biopsies. Currently available data are insufficient for a substitution of histologic classification and grading of astrocytic tumors by genetic typing alone. More subtypes of glioblastomas may exist with intermediate clinical and genetic profiles, a factor exemplified by the giant-cell glioblastoma that clinically and genetically occupies a hybrid position between primary (de novo) and secondary glioblastomas.

The rapidly emerging focus on cancer stem cells embodies a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumor pathogenesis, while the development of powerful genome-wide screening techniques has provided cause for optimism related to the development of more reliable therapies primarily targeting GBM stem cells (GBMSCs). There are promising mounting data on providing new molecular targets and predictive markers of response, leading to more effective therapies of GBM, guided by patient-specific genetic and epigenetic profiling. However, the achievement of efficient GBMSC targeting also requires an adequate understanding of the unique microenvironment, and the relationship with the immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) and CNS tumors. The endogenous immune regulation is likely to limit or abrogate the efficacy of the host's immune response, as well as the developed immunotherapeutic strategies at present. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the GBM-induced immunosuppression is indispensable.

In this study, following an integrative diagnosis of 227 GBMs based on the 2021 World Health Organization classification system, the cases were histologically fractionated by cellular variations and abundance to evaluate the relationship between cellular heterogeneity and prognosis in combination with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene promoter methylation (mMGMTp) status. GBMs comprised four major cell types: astrocytic, pleomorphic, gemistocytic, and rhabdoid cells. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis using the histological abundance of heterogeneous cell types identified two distinct groups with significantly different prognoses. In individual cell component analysis, the abundance of gemistocytes showed a significantly favorable prognosis but confounding to mMGMTp status. Conversely, the abundance of epithelioid cells was correlated with the unfavorable prognosis. Linear model analysis showed the favorable prognostic utility of quantifying gemistocytic and epithelioid cells, independent of mMGMTp.

Observed survival rates were 42.4% at 6 months, 17.7% at 1 year, and 3.3% at 2 years. For all of the age groups, younger patients survived significantly longer, ranging from a median of 8.8 months (<50 years) to 1.6 months (>80 years). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 10q was the most frequent genetic alteration (69%), followed by EGFR amplification (34%), TP53 mutations (31%), p16(INK4a) deletion (31%), and PTEN mutations (24%). LOH 10q occurred in association with any of the other genetic alterations and was predictive of shorter survival. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas prevailed (95%), whereas secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic gliomas were rare (5%). Secondary glioblastomas were characterized by frequent LOH 10q (63%) and TP53 mutations (65%). Of the TP53 mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57% were in hotspot codons 248 and 273, whereas in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more equally distributed.

However, little was known about the correlation between CPEB4 and glioblastoma cell proliferation and the prognostic significance in patients. Our aim was to investigate the functional role and prognostic value of CPEB4 in glioblastoma. Patients and methods: We determined the expression of CPEB4 protein using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing 278 glioma patients (including 98 primary glioblastomas) and evaluated its association with pathological grades and clinical outcome by univariate and multivariate analyses. And then, lentiviral-mediated RNAi targeting CPEB4 was utilized to study the role of CPEB4 in glioblastoma cell proliferation. Results: In our cohort, CPEB4 expression was positively related to glioma pathological grade (p < 0.01) and elevated in glioblastoma (p < 0.01). High expression of CPEB4 was associated with significantly poor prognosis, and could be identified as an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of glioblastoma patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.730, p = 0.014 and HR = 1.877, p = 0.004, respectively). In vitro studies further showed that downregulation of CPEB4 significantly reduced the growth rate of T98G and U251 cells comparing with the controls. Conclusion: Our study indicated that increased expression of CPEB4 in primary glioblastoma is a novel biomarker for predicting poor outcome of patients and suppression of CPEB4 inhibit tumor cell proliferation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29642043
"""Glioblastoma complicated by fatal malignant acute ischemic stroke: MRI finding to assist in tricky surgical decision.""","""Background: In most cases, glioblastomas are associated with seizures, headaches, neurological deficits, aphasia, or bleeding. But these tumors are rarely associated with cerebral infarction and never so deadly. Case report: A 40-year-old man presented with sudden morning isolated aphasia. One hour later, he developed a motor deficit at right upper member, quickly completed with a total right hemiplegia. Imaging studies revealed a left frontotemporal enhancing glioblastoma with a perilesional edema which produced an important mass effect on the posterior arm of the external capsule, on the primary motor cortex posteriorly and the entire sylvian valley anteriorly. Due to major surgical risks associated with left middle cerebral artery (MCA) inclusion and large edema, we decided to postpone the tumor removal and introduce quickly high concentrations of steroids. Twenty-four hours after his admittance, the patient presented a sudden impaired consciousness, coma, and a left mydriasis. A brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a left malignant MCA infarction, deadly for the patient. Conclusion: To our knowledge, glioblastomas complicated by fatal ischemic stroke have not been reported. We discuss the pathology of such an event and try to figure out if it was predictable based on MRI finding, and inevitable with precocious surgery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26306931

Pathway components are overexpressed in many tumors including glioblastoma. Previous studies showed that the expression of SphK1 influenced survival of glioblastoma patients, yet the roles of SphK1-2 and receptors S1P1-3 and S1P5 have not been investigated in different forms of glioblastoma. Samples from 59 patients (37 males, 22 females, age 55.1 ± 17.1 years) suffering from primary (n = 35), recurrent (n = 18), and secondary (n = 6) glioblastomas were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry for expression levels of SphK1 and SphK2 and S1P1-3 and S1P5. Sixteen autopsy nontumorous brain specimens were used as controls. Expression data was correlated with clinical data and patient survival. All markers were overexpressed in the glioblastoma specimens compared to the non-neoplastic brain tissue. SphK1 and all S1P receptors were expressed in increasing order of magnitude from primary, up to recurrent and secondary glioblastomas, with values of up to 44-fold compared to normal brain tissue. In contrast, SphK2 levels were highest in primary tumors (25-fold). Expression of the sphingosine signaling pathway components was influenced by radio/radiochemotherapy in distinct ways. Immunohistochemistry for SphK1 and S1P1 confirmed the overexpression in glioblastoma. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses identified S1P5 messenger RNA levels as an independent prognostic factor of survival. The sphingosine pathway is overexpressed in glioma. Its components show distinct expression patterns in the tumor subgroups. S1P5 is identified as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis, and this pathway promises to be a candidate for targeted therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24903384
"""Alternative splicing of the p15 cdk inhibitor in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Thirty-four to fifty-six percent of malignant gliomas harbor homozygous co-deletions of the INK4a(p16-p14ARF) and INK4b(p15) tumor suppressor genes. Recently, an alternatively spliced form of p15 has been cloned and termed p10 based on the presumed molecular weight of the protein. In this study, we have investigated the role of p10 expression in human glioblastomas. Both, wild-type p15 and p10 were detected in three of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Sixteen of twenty-nine (55%) glioblastoma tumor samples contained INK4b transcripts, but only nine (31%) tumors expressed p15 protein. Three p15 protein-negative tumors expressed only p10 mRNA. Preferential expression of p10 was not due to splice site mutations. Strong suppression of tumorigenicity was seen in four glioblastoma cell lines after transfection with p15 but not with p10. Loss of p15 protein expression was almost always accompanied by loss of p16 expression. p1 6/p15-negative tumors commonly lacked p14ARF expression. These results suggest that differential splicing of the INK4b gene may result in the expression of p10 at the expense of p15, which would lead to loss of p15-mediated growth suppression. This novel mechanism of loss of p15 might complement alterations of the INK4a tumor suppressor gene in some glioblastomas, resulting in combined loss of p16, p15 and p14ARF.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11563632
"""Glioblastoma with tumor-to-tumor metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a tumor with widely variable morphology. It may rarely show pseudoepithelial components or true epithelial differentiation. Metastasis to glioblastomas have been previously reported, but were unsupported by immunohistochemical or molecular analyses. Herein we describe a glioblastoma with carcinomatous foci in a patient with no past clinical history of tumors outside the central nervous system. The carcinomatous foci expressed epithelial, but not glial markers. Therefore, whole-body imaging was carried out to verify the presence of carcinoma. A lung mass was biopsied and it resulted as primary lung adenocarcinoma. Carcinomatous foci of glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma had the same KRAS mutation which was absent in glial areas of the glioblastoma. Thus, glioblastoma with tumor-to-tumor metastasis was diagnosed. This case demonstrates that, albeit rare, metastases to glioblastoma may occur, and they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of glioblastoma with carcinomatous foci. Even when the past clinical history is negative, the presence of carcinoma should be investigated to rule out glioblastoma with tumor-to-tumor metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31523853

"""Pathological findings and prognostic factors in recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas, which are the most common primary intracranial tumor, are associated with the poorest survival time, which is typically 1-2 years. Age at initial diagnosis, Karnofsky performance score, and O(6)-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status are the most well-documented predictors of survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Few studies have examined prognostic factors in patients with recurrent glioblastomas. At relapse, the pathological features of glioblastomas are affected by tumor regrowth and the influence of chemoradiotherapy during the initial treatment. Morphological transformations at recurrence include quantitative changes in tumor cells, such as the presence of giant cells and gemistocytic cell formation, radiation necrosis, and vascular structural changes. Therefore, we should carefully examine pathological findings at recurrence. In this report, we analyzed MGMT promoter status, the MIB-1 index, and the pathology of tumor samples at the first (primary tumor) and second (recurrent tumor) surgeries and clarified prognostic factors in patients with recurrent cases. In the multivariate analysis, we showed that MIB-1 indexes at the time of the second surgery (p = 0.004) persisted as a significant independent prognostic factor in survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22331317

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 54 meningiomas, 12 glioblastomas and 13 solitary metastases. We detected 6 meningiomas with atypical features on conventional MRI resembling intraaxial tumors. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBV) ratios of all tumors were calculated via perfusion-weighted MRI. The signal intensity-time curves were plotted and three different curve patterns were observed. The type 1 curve resembled normal brain parenchyma or the postenhancement part was minimally below the baseline, the type 2 curve was similar to the type 1 curve but with the postenhancement part above the baseline, and the type 3 curve had the postenhancement part below the baseline accompanied by widening of the curve. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: On CBV images meningiomas were hypervascular and the mean rCBV ratio was 10.58+/-2.00. For glioblastomas and metastatic lesions, the rCBV ratios were 5.02+/-1.40 and 4.68+/-1.54, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in rCBV ratios between meningiomas and glioblastomas and metastases (P<0.001). Only one of the meningiomas displayed a type 2 curve while five showed a type 3 curve. Glioblastomas and metastases displayed either a type 1 or a type 2 curve. None of the meningiomas showed a type 1 curve and none of the glioblastomas or metastases showed a type 3 curve. Conclusion: Differentiating meningiomas with atypical conventional MRI findings from malignant intraaxial tumors can be difficult. Calculation of rCBV ratios and construction of signal intensity-time curves may contribute to the differentiation of meningiomas from intraaxial tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16896907
"""Prognostic Value of PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA Ratio in Patients With Primary Glioblastoma (IDH-Wildtype).""","""A hallmark of glioblastoma is the high level of aerobic glycolysis. PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 are regulatory glycolytic enzymes, which are overexpressed in glioblastomas. Selective inhibition of these enzymes has emerged as a new approach in tumor therapy. We investigated the ratios of PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA expression in 66 astrocytic tumors of different malignancy grades. PFKFB3 mRNA levels were considerably higher than those of PFKFB4 in all analyzed tumors. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showed lower PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios (7.7:1) than IDH-mutant low-grade astrocytomas (36.5:1), indicating a dependency of the ratio on malignancy grade. In IDH-wildtype glioblastomas exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PFKFB3 gene locus, the decrease of PFKFB3 mRNA levels was accompanied by lower PFKFB4 mRNA levels, but the PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratio did not differ between tumors with or without PFKFB3 LOH. IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma patients with high PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios above the average of 7.7:1 had a significantly longer overall survival time (14 months) than patients with lower ratios (9 months). Our results indicate that low PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 expression ratio is a poor prognostic factor in patients with IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma and that PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 might represent promising targets for astrocytoma and glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31369092
"""Ribozyme-targeting reveals the rate-limiting role of pleiotrophin in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most frequent malignant brain tumors with very limited treatment options and nearly all GBM patients dying within 1 year. Pleiotrophin (PTN, HB-GAM, HBNF, OSF-1) is a secreted growth factor that shows mitogenic, chemotactic and transforming activity. While PTN expression is tightly regulated during embryogenesis and very limited in normal adult tissues, a marked PTN upregulation is seen in tumors including glioblastomas. Targeting of the PTN receptors, ALK and RPTP-zeta, indicates a contribution of PTN-activated signaling pathways in glioblastomas. However, the relevance of PTN expression itself is unknown especially since, besides PTN, at least one more growth factor, midkine (MK), signals through ALK and is expressed in glioblastoma. Here we demonstrate the biologic relevance of PTN in 2 glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We show that stable ribozyme-targeting leads to a robust reduction of PTN mRNA and protein levels. This results in decreased cell proliferation, cell migration and soft agar colony formation in vitro. Comparing clonal ribozyme-transfected cells with different residual PTN levels, we establish a PTN gene-dose effect of glioblastoma cell proliferation. In a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model, in vivo growth is markedly reduced upon PTN depletion, which is paralleled by decreased PTN serum levels. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors shows reduced angiogenesis in PTN-depleted tumors. We conclude that PTN is a rate-limiting growth factor in glioblastoma. Since PTN is overexpressed in glioblastomas but rarely found in normal tissue, PTN may represent an attractive therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15986444

Methods: Multivariable Cox regression was applied to survival data of 647 consecutive patients diagnosed with de novo glioblastoma between 2005 and 2013 in order to investigate the association between epilepsy and survival in glioblastoma patients. In addition, we quantified the association between survival and valproic acid (VPA) treatment. Results: Epilepsy correlated positively with survival (HR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61-0.92), P < .01). This effect is independent of age, sex, performance status, type of surgery, adjuvant therapy, tumor location, and tumor volume, suggesting that this positive correlation cannot be attributed solely to early diagnosis. For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment. Conclusion: Epilepsy is an independent prognostic factor for longer survival in glioblastoma patients.

"""Expression analysis of progesterone-regulated miRNAs in cells derived from human glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most frequent and malignant type of brain tumor. It has been reported that progesterone (P4) regulates the progression of GBMs by modifying the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion; however, it is not fully understood how these processes are regulated. It is possible that P4 mediates some of these effects through changes in the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in GBM cells. The present study investigated the effects of P4 on miRNAs expression profile in U‑251MG cells derived from a human GBM. U‑251MG cells were treated for 6 h with P4, RU486 (an antagonist of the intracellular progesterone receptor), the combined treatment (P4+RU486) and cyclodextrin (vehicle) and then a miRNA microarray analysis conducted. The expression analysis revealed a set of 190 miRNAs with differential expression in the treatments of P4, RU486 and P4+RU486 in respect to the vehicle and P4 in respect to P4+RU486, of which only 16 were exclusively regulated by P4. The possible mRNA targets of the miRNAs regulated by P4 could participate in the regulation of proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell migration of GBMs. The present study provided insight for understanding epigenetic modifications regulated by sex hormones involved in GBM progression, and for identifying potential therapeutic strategies for these brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33899118

The cDNA array results were confirmed by Northern and Western blotting. The fact that the IGFBP2 gene, which is normally expressed in fetal cells and turned off in adult cells, becomes reactivated in the most advanced stage of glioma suggests that glioma progression is a result of dedifferentiation or results from a block of differentiation.

The CSF collection was obtained during surgery, before any surgical manipulation of the tumor. The extracted tDNA and corresponding tumor DNA samples were analyzed for TERTp and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) hotspot mutations. In addition, the variant allele frequency (VAF) of TERTp mutation in the CSF-tDNA was correlated with tumor features and patients' outcome.Results: Thirty-eight patients had TERTp-mutant/IDH wild-type glioblastomas. The matched TERTp mutation in the CSF-tDNA was successfully detected with 100% specificity (95% CI, 87.6-100%) and 92.1% sensitivity (95% CI, 78.6-98.3%) (n = 35/38). In contrast, the sensitivity in the plasma-tDNA was far lower [n = 3/38, 7.9% (95% CI, 1.6-21.4%)].

Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 66 patients who underwent STB in their institution. Preoperative factors including age, sex, platelet count, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, activated thromboplastin time, antiplatelet agent use, history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, target location, anesthesia type, and ITSS data were recorded. ITSS was defined as a dot-like or fine linear low signal within a tumor on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and was graded using a 3-point scale: grade 1, no ITSS within the lesion; grade 2, 1-10 ITSSs; and grade 3, ≥ 11 ITSSs. Postoperative final tumor pathology was also reviewed. The association between preoperative variables and the size of postoperative hemorrhage was examined. Results: Thirty-four patients were men and 32 were women. The mean age was 66.6 years. The most common tumor location was the frontal lobe (27.3%, n = 18). The diagnostic yield of STB was 93.9%. The most common pathology was lymphoma (36.4%, n = 24). The ITSS was grade 1 in 37 patients (56.1%), grade 2 in 14 patients (21.2%), and grade 3 in 15 patients (22.7%). Interobserver agreement for ITSS was almost perfect (weighted kappa = 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98). Age was significantly associated with ITSS (p = 0.0075). Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 17 patients (25.8%). Maximum hemorrhage diameter (mean ± SD) was 1.78 ± 1.35 mm in grade 1 lesions, 2.98 ± 2.2 mm in grade 2 lesions, and 9.51 ± 2.11 mm in grade 3 lesions (p = 0.01). Hemorrhage > 10 mm in diameter occurred in 10 patients (15.2%), being symptomatic in 3 of them. Four of 6 patients with grade 3 ITSS glioblastomas (66.7%) had postoperative hemorrhages > 10 mm in diameter. After adjusting for age, ITSS grade was the only factor significantly associated with hemorrhage > 10 mm (p = 0.029).

Herein, through the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data and clinical glioma samples, we found Wnt/β-catenin signal was activated in GBM and inversely related to the degree of immune cell (CD8+) infiltration and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signal could inhibit GBM U118 cells' growth and migration, and upregulate their PD-L1 expression which indicated the possible better response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Besides, in a co-culture system comprising U118 cells and Jurkat cells, Wnt inhibition alleviated Jurkat cell's apoptosis and enhanced its cytotoxic function as evidenced by obviously increased effector cytokine IFNγ secretion and lactate dehydrogenase release. Moreover, the enhanced anti-GBM effect of PD-1 antibody triggered by Wnt inhibition was observed in GL261 homograft mouse model, and the upregulation of immune cell (CD4+/CD8+) infiltration and IFNγ secretion in tumor tissues suggested that Wnt/β-catenin inhibition could inflame cold tumor and then sensitize GBM to PD-1 blockade therapy. Taken together, our study verified the blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signal could augment the efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapy on GBM through directly inhibiting tumor proliferation and migration, as well as facilitating T-cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression in tumor microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34001635
"""beta1 integrin targeting potentiates antiangiogenic therapy and inhibits the growth of bevacizumab-resistant glioblastoma.""","""Antiangiogenic therapies like bevacizumab offer promise for cancer treatment, but acquired resistance, which often includes an aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, can limit the use of these agents. Upregulation of β1 integrin (ITGB1) occurs in some bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRG) whereby, mediating tumor-microenvironment interactions, we hypothesized that it may mediate a mesenchymal-type resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. Immunostaining analyses of β1 integrin and its downstream effector kinase FAK revealed upregulation in 75% and 86% of BRGs, respectively, compared with pretreatment paired specimens. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed eight-fold more β1 integrin in primary BRG cells compared with cells from bevacizumab-naïve glioblastomas (BNG). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of cells engineered to express a β1-GFP fusion protein indicated that the mobile β1 integrin fraction was doubled, and half-life of β1 integrin turnover in focal adhesions was reduced markedly in BRG cells compared with bevacizumab-responsive glioblastoma multiforme cells. Hypoxia, which was increased with acquisition of bevacizumab resistance, was associated with increased β1 integrin expression in cultured BNG cells. BRGs displayed an aggressive mesenchymal-like phenotype in vitro. We found that growth of BRG xenograft tumors was attenuated by the β1 antibody, OS2966, allowing a 20-fold dose reduction of bevacizumab per cycle in this model. Intracranial delivery of OS2966 through osmotic pumps over 28 days increased tumor cell apoptosis, decreased tumor cell invasiveness, and blunted the mesenchymal morphology of tumor cells. We concluded that β1 integrin upregulation in BRGs likely reflects an onset of hypoxia caused by antiangiogenic therapy, and that β1 inhibition is well tolerated in vivo as a tractable strategy to disrupt resistance to this therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23644530

Currently, there are many ways to detect a patient's MGMT promotor methylation status, including: quantitative PCR, methylation-specific PCR, pyrosequencing, real time PCR with high resolution melt, and the infinitum methylation EPIC beadChip. The technical aspects, shortcomings, and optimal approach to interpreting the results of each method will be discussed. Furthermore, given that none of these methods have been prospectively validated, the challenge of equivocal cases will be discussed, and technical and logistic strategies for overcoming these challenges will be proposed. Finally, the difficulty in validating these methods, establishing standardized practice, and considerations of the cost of these competing methods will be explored.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30444735
"""Inhibiting autophagy flux and DNA repair of tumor cells to boost radiotherapy of orthotopic glioblastoma.""","""Radio-resistance of glioblastoma (GBM) remains a leading cause of radiotherapy failure because of the protective autophagy induced by X-Ray irradiation and tumor cells' strong capability of repairing damaged DNA. It is of great importance to overcome the radio-resistance for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the novel mechanism of core-shell copper selenide coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Cu2-xSe NPs) inhibiting the protective autophagy and DNA repair of tumor cells to drastically boost the radiotherapy efficacy of glioblastoma. We reveal that the core-shell Au@Cu2-xSe NPs can inhibit the autophagy flux by effectively alkalizing lysosomes. They can increase the SQSTM1/p62 protein levels of tumor cells without influencing their mRNA. We also reveal that Au@Cu2-xSe NPs can increase the ubiquitination of DNA repair protein Rad51, and promote the degradation of Rad51 by proteasomes to prevent the DNA repair. The simultaneous inhibition of protective autophagy and DNA repair significantly suppress the growth of orthotopic GBM by using radiotherapy and our novel Au@Cu2-xSe NPs. Our work provides a new insight and paradigm to significantly improve the efficacy of radiotherapy by rationally designing theranostic nano-agents to simultaneously inhibit protective autophagy and DNA repair of tumor cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864449
"""Expression of vascular Notch ligands Delta-like 4 and Jagged-1 in glioblastoma.""","""Aims: The coordinated expression of the Notch ligands Delta-like 4 (Dll4) and Jagged (Jag)1 is believed to define appropriate endothelial sensitivity to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Preclinical data suggest that Dll4-Notch signalling may confer resistance to anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab, and Jag1 may antagonize Dll4-Notch. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression of Dll4 and Jag1 in primary glioblastomas. Methods and results: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40 glioblastomas and normal brain using validated antibodies against Dll4 and Jag1. In-situ hybridization for Dll4 was performed on serial sections and compared with protein expression. Dll4 expression was localized to the cytoplasm and membrane of endothelial cells in all glioblastomas; it was weak or absent in normal brain. Jag1 expression was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of glomeruloid and non-glomeruloid endothelial cells from 76% and 67% of glioblastomas, respectively. However, endothelial Jag1 expression was less intense and less prevalent than Dll4. There was no association between Dll4 and Jag1 expression. Conclusions: In summary, Dll4 and Jag1 are expressed in glioblastoma vasculature. These data may define subsets of glioblastoma that might be sensitive (Dll4(+) /Jag1(+) ) or resistant (Dll4(+) /Jag1(-) ) to bevacizumab. Our data also suggest that anti-Dll4 therapy should be evaluated experimentally in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296176
"""Alpha Particle Enhanced Blood Brain/Tumor Barrier Permeabilization in Glioblastomas Using Integrin Alpha-v Beta-3-Targeted Liposomes.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant astrocytoma characterized by extensive invasion, angiogenesis, hypoxia, and micrometastasis. Despite the relatively leaky nature of GBM blood vessels, effective delivery of antitumor therapeutics has been a major challenge due to the complications caused by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the highly torturous nature of newly formed tumor vasculature (blood tumor barrier-BTB). External beam radiotherapy was previously shown to be an effective means of permeabilizing central nervous system (CNS) barriers. By using targeted short-ranged radionuclides, we show for the first time that our targeted actinium-225-labeled αvβ3-specific liposomes (225Ac-IA-TLs) caused catastrophic double stranded DNA breaks and significantly enhanced the permeability of BBB and BTB in mice bearing orthotopic GBMs. Histologic studies revealed characteristic α-particle induced double strand breaks within tumors but was not significantly present in normal brain regions away from the tumor where BBB permeability was observed. These findings indicate that the enhanced vascular permeability in these distal regions did not result from direct α-particle-induced DNA damage. On the basis of these results, in addition to their direct antitumor effects, 225Ac-IA-TLs can potentially be used to enhance the permeability of BBB and BTB for effective delivery of systemically administered antitumor therapeutics.

"""MiRNA-196 is upregulated in glioblastoma but not in anaplastic astrocytoma and has prognostic significance.""","""Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short noncoding RNAs that can play critical roles in diverse biological processes. They are implicated in tumorigenesis and function both as tumor suppressors and as oncogenes. The clinical significance of miRNA expression profiles in malignant gliomas remains unclear. Experimental design: In this study, we examined the expression levels of 365 mature human miRNAs in 12 malignant gliomas, including 8 glioblastomas and 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR arrays. A validation study was done to corroborate a subset of the results, including expression levels of miR-196a, -196b, -21, and -15b, by analyzing 92 malignant gliomas by conventional real-time PCR. We modeled the relationship between the expression levels of these miRNAs and the survival rate of 39 glioblastoma patients by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis. Results: Expression profiles in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas suggested that 16 miRNAs were candidate markers associated with the malignant progression of gliomas. Among them, miR-196a showed the most significant difference (P = 0.0038), with miR-196b also having a high significance (P = 0.0371). Both miRNAs showed increased expression levels in glioblastomas relative to both anaplastic astrocytomas and normal brains in the validation study. Furthermore, patients with high miR-196 expression levels showed significantly poorer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method (P = 0.0073). Multivariate analysis showed that miR-196 expression levels were an independent predictor of overall survival in all 39 glioblastoma patients (P = 0.021; hazard ratio, 2.81). Conclusions: Our results suggest that miR-196 may play a role in the malignant progression of gliomas and may be a prognostic predictor in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20601442
"""Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as a theragnostic target for mesenchymal-type glioblastoma patients.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by four subtypes, proneural (PN), neural, classical, and mesenchymal (MES) GBMs, and they all have distinct activated signaling pathways. Among the subtypes, PN and MES GBMs show mutually exclusive genetic signatures, and the MES phenotype is, in general, believed to be associated with more aggressive features of GBM: tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Therefore, targeting MES GBMs would improve the overall prognosis of patients with fatal tumors. In this study, we propose peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker as well as therapeutic target for MES GBM; we used multiple approaches to assess PPARγ, including biostatistics analysis and assessment of preclinical studies. First, we found that PPARγ was exclusively expressed in MES glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), and ligand activation of endogenous PPARγ suppressed cell growth and stemness in MES GSCs. Further in vivo studies involving orthotopic and heterotopic xenograft mouse models confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PPARγ; compared to control mice, those that received ligand treatment exhibited longer survival as well as decreased tumor burden. Mechanistically, PPARγ activation suppressed proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway. Biostatistical analysis using The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA, n = 206) and REMBRANDT (n = 329) revealed that PPARγ upregulation is linked to poor overall survival and disease-free survival of GBM patients. Analysis was performed on prospective (n = 2) and retrospective (n = 6) GBM patient tissues, and we finally confirmed that PPARγ expression was distinctly upregulated in MES GBM. Collectively, this study provides insight into PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target for patients with MES GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280134
"""TPPP3 promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Snail1 in glioblastoma.""","""Tubulin polymerization promoting protein 3 (TPPP3), a member of the tubulin polymerization family, participates in cell progressions in several human cancers, its biological function and the underlying mechanisms in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role and application value of TPPP3 in gliomas and found that the expression of TPPP3 in glioma was higher than that in normal brain tissue (NBT), and increased with the grade of glioma. Up-regulation of TPPP3 expression in glioblastoma cells confer stronger ability of migration, invasion, proliferation and lower apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of TPPP3 expression in GBM could reduce the migration, invasion, proliferation and induce the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. TPPP3 affected the process of EMT by regulating the expression of Snail 1 protein. In clinical data analysis, we found a positive correlation between TPPP3 and Snail1 protein expression levels in glioblastomas. Low TPPP3 expression leads to better survival expectations in glioblastomas patients. The content of this study paves the way for further in-depth exploration of the role of TPPP3 in glioblastoma in the future, and provides new treatment and research directions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37863960
"""Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics reveal cancer-associated fibroblasts in glioblastoma with protumoral effects.""","""Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were presumed absent in glioblastoma given the lack of brain fibroblasts. Serial trypsinization of glioblastoma specimens yielded cells with CAF morphology and single-cell transcriptomic profiles based on their lack of copy number variations (CNVs) and elevated individual cell CAF probability scores derived from the expression of 9 CAF markers and absence of 5 markers from non-CAF stromal cells sharing features with CAFs. Cells without CNVs and with high CAF probability scores were identified in single-cell RNA-Seq of 12 patient glioblastomas. Pseudotime reconstruction revealed that immature CAFs evolved into subtypes, with mature CAFs expressing actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (ACTA2). Spatial transcriptomics from 16 patient glioblastomas confirmed CAF proximity to mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), endothelial cells, and M2 macrophages. CAFs were chemotactically attracted to GSCs, and CAFs enriched GSCs. We created a resource of inferred crosstalk by mapping expression of receptors to their cognate ligands, identifying PDGF and TGF-β as mediators of GSC effects on CAFs and osteopontin and HGF as mediators of CAF-induced GSC enrichment. CAFs induced M2 macrophage polarization by producing the extra domain A (EDA) fibronectin variant that binds macrophage TLR4. Supplementing GSC-derived xenografts with CAFs enhanced in vivo tumor growth. These findings are among the first to identify glioblastoma CAFs and their GSC interactions, making them an intriguing target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36856115
"""Is there pseudoprogression in secondary glioblastomas?""","""Purpose: Pseudoprogression (PP) during adjuvant treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is frequent and is a clinically and radiologically challenging problem. While there are several reports of the frequency of PP in GBM cohorts including mainly patients with primary GBM, there are few data on the incidence of PP in patients with secondary glioblastomas (sGBM). Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PP in sGBM. Methods and materials: We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of PP in adult patients with sGBM treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRTx) using temozolomide (TMZ) and sought to assess if there was an association between PP and MGMT promoter methylation status, IDH mutations status, or 1p/19q codeletion. The definition of PP according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group was used. Results: None of the evaluable 15 sGBM patients in our series demonstrated a PP. Of the 9 sGBM patients who received concomitant CRTx with TMZ, 6 patients had the methylated MGMT promoter, and 6 patients had IDH mutations. There also was no PP identified in sGBM patients who received sequential CRTx, irrespective of MGMT or IDH status. The median time of follow-up was 3.4 years after diagnosis of an sGBM, and the median overall survival was 18.2 months (range, 14.3-45.2 months). Three of 15 patients had previously received radiation therapy for their World Health Organization low-grade 2 glioma, while none of them had received chemotherapy at that stage. Conclusions: Based on this small series of sGBM patients treated with CRTx (concomitantly or sequentially) the frequency of PP appears to be very low in sGBM, even in those patients with methylated MGMT promoter or IDH mutations. Our results highlight the differences between primary glioblastomas and sGBM in particular as they relate to PP.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267971

One of the most intrigued subtypes is the long-term survival (LTS) GBM, which responds better to current therapies. The present investigation on GBM from 50 consecutive GBM displaying classic survival and seven LTS GBM is based on molecular epigenetic, clinical and histopathological analyses. Our aim was to recognize biomarkers useful to distinguish LTS from classic GBM. We analyzed the promoter methylation status of key regulator genes implicated in tumor invasion (TIMP2, TIMP3), apoptosis and inflammation (TMS1/ASC, DAPK) as well as overall survival, therapy status and tumor pathological features. For the first purpose a methylation-specific PCR approach was performed to analyze the CpG island promoter methylation status of each gene. The overall TMS1/ASC methylation rate in the 57 analyzed tumors was 21.05%. Hypermethylation of TMS1/ASC was significantly more frequent in LTS GBM (57.1% vs. 16%, P=0.029, Fisher's exact test). DAPK promoter hypermethylation was only observed in the LTS subset (14.3%) whereas TIMP2 and TIMP3 were unmethylated in both GBM collectives.

The three human ELMO genes play key roles in cellular motility, and have been linked to metastasis and poor prognosis in other cancer types. The aim of this study was to investigate methylation levels of the ELMO genes and their correlation to clinical characteristics and outcome in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. To measure DNA methylation levels we designed pyrosequencing assays targeting the promoter CpG island of each the ELMO genes. These were applied to diagnostic tumor specimens from a well-characterized cohort of 121 patients who received standard treatment consisting of surgery, radiation therapy, plus concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. The promoter methylation levels of ELMO1 and ELMO2 were generally low, whereas ELMO3 methylation levels were high, in the tumor biopsies. Thirteen, six, and 18 biopsies were defined as aberrantly methylated for ELMO1, ELMO2, and ELMO3, respectively. There were no significant associations between the methylation status of any of the ELMO gene promoter CpG islands and overall survival, progression-free survival, and clinical characteristics of the patients including intracranial tumor location.

Here, we extend this observation and show that a subset of primary glioblastoma tumors and their derived tumor lines express cellular and molecular markers that are associated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and that glioblastoma cell cultures can be induced to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineage-like cell types.

Studies of nonglioma cell lines have demonstrated that WT1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, this ability has not been rigorously analyzed in human GBM. Methods: The authors tested the efficacy of 2 sequences of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against WT1 in U251MG human GBM cells and found that 1 sequence was capable of stably silencing WT1 expression. They then evaluated the effect of WT1 silencing on cellular proliferation, invasion, and in vivo tumor formation. Results: Stable WT1-shRNA expression significantly decreased the proliferation of U251MG cells in vitro as demonstrated by both an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-based viability assay and tritiated thymidine uptake. Furthermore, stable WT1 silencing caused significantly slower growth after the subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells in the flanks of athymic nude mice and was associated with an increased latency period. Conclusions: Data in this study provide proof of the principle that downregulation of WT1 causes decreased tumorigenicity of a GBM cell line in vitro and in vivo and suggest that WT1 is a promising target for novel molecular GBM therapies, perhaps in combination with standard treatment modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19392599

Objective: to determine the occurrence rate of long-living patients with glioblastomas, identify clinical predictors of a favorable prognosis, and identify the presence and prognostic significance of an IDH1 mutation. Material and methods: Among 1494 patients operated on for glioblastoma at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute from 2007 to 2012, there were 84 (5.6%) patients who lived more than 3 years after primary surgery. In all the cases, histological specimens were reviewed, and immunohistochemical detection of a mutant IDH1 protein was performed. Overall survival was calculated from the time of first surgery to the date of the last consultation or death, and the recurrence-free period was calculated from the time of first surgery to MRI-verified tumor progression. Results: The median age of long-living patients with glioblastoma was 45 years (19-65 years). All tumors were located supratentorially. The median Karnofsky performance status score at the time of surgery was 80 (range, 70-100). All patients underwent microsurgical resection of the tumor, followed by chemoradiotherapy. The median recurrence-free period was 36 months (5-98 months). Overall survival of 48, 60, and 84 months was achieved in 23, 15 and 6% of patients, respectively.

Conclusion: The significance of various factors that may be predictors of a favorable course of the disease is discussed in the literature. This work is the first part of analysis of prognostically significant factors positively affecting overall survival of glioblastoma patients. In our series, the predictors of a favorable prognosis for long-living patients with the verified diagnosis of glioblastoma were as follows: young age, the supratentorial location of the tumor, a high Karnofsky score before surgery, and tumor resection. In our series, we used immunohistochemical tests and found no prognostic significance of the IDH1 gene mutation; further analysis will require application of direct sequencing.

Materials and methods: In this study, diffusion-tensor MR imaging was performed preoperatively in 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms, including meningiomas, metastatic lesions, glioblastomas multiforme, and low-grade gliomas. Histograms of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were used to analyze both the tumor and the associated T2 signal intensity abnormality. An additional metric, the tumor infiltration index (TII), was evaluated. The TII is a measure of the change in FA presumably caused by tumor cells infiltrating the peritumoral edema. Student t test and least-squares linear regression analyses were performed. Results: Peritumoral MD and FA values indicated no statistically significant difference between intra- and extraaxial lesions or between high- and low-grade gliomas. Regarding intraaxial tumors, the measured mean peritumoral MD of metastatic lesions, 0.733 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.061 (SD), was significantly higher than that of gliomas, 0.587 +/- 0.093 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec (P <.05). There was also a statistically significant difference between the TIIs of the edema surrounding meningiomas and metastases (mean, 0 +/- 35) and the TIIs of the edema surrounding gliomas (mean, 64 +/- 59) (P <.05).

"""A distinct subset of glioma cell lines with stem cell-like properties reflects the transcriptional phenotype of glioblastomas and overexpresses CXCR4 as therapeutic target.""","""Glioblastomas contain stem-like cells that can be maintained in vitro using specific serum-free conditions. We investigated whether glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines preserve the expression phenotype of human glioblastomas more closely than conventional glioma cell lines. Expression profiling revealed that a distinct subset of GS lines, which displayed a full stem-like phenotype (GSf), mirrored the expression signature of glioblastomas more closely than either other GS lines or cell lines grown in serum. GSf lines are highly tumorigenic and invasive in vivo, express CD133, grow spherically in vitro, are multipotent and display a Proneural gene expression signature, thus recapitulating key functional and transcriptional aspects of human glioblastomas. In contrast, GS lines with a restricted stem-like phenotype exhibited expression signatures more similar to conventional cell lines than to original patient tumors, suggesting that the transcriptional resemblance between GS lines and tumors is associated with different degrees of 'stemness'. Among markers overexpressed in patient tumors and GSf lines, we identified CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target. GSf lines contained a minor population of CXCR4(hi) cells, a subfraction of which coexpressed CD133 and was expandable by hypoxia, whereas conventional cell lines contained only CXCR4(lo) cells. Convection-enhanced local treatment with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the highly invasive growth of GS xenografts in vivo and cell migration in vitro.

"""Autophagy, the Trojan horse to combat glioblastomas.""","""Malignant gliomas, among which glioblastomas constitute the largest group, are characterized by a dramatically diffuse infiltration into the brain parenchyma with, as a consequence, the fact that no patient with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been cured to date. Migrating GBM cells are resistant to apoptosis (Type I programmed cell death), and thus to radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy, because of the constitutive activation of several intracellular signaling pathways, of which the most important identified to date are the pathways controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Migrating GBM cells seem to be less prone to resist autophagy (Type II programmed cell death), and disruption of the pathway controlled by mTOR induces marked autophagic processes in GBM cells. Temozolomide is the most efficacious cytotoxic drug employed today to combat glioblastoma, and this drug exerts its cytotoxic activity through proautophagic processes. Thus, autophagy represents a kind of Trojan horse that can be used to bypass, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of glioblastoma to radiotherapy and proapoptotic-related chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16709038

Recent findings: The appropriate initial evaluation and accurate diagnosis of gliomas require an understanding of the spectrum of clinical and radiographic presentations. Recent advances in the understanding of distinct molecular prognostic subtypes have led to major revisions in the diagnostic classification of gliomas. Integration of these new diagnostic and molecular classifications is an important part of the modern management of gliomas and facilitates better understanding and interpretation of the efficacy of different therapies in specific glioma subtypes.

"""Concurrent EGFR amplification and TP-53 mutation in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and most aggressive of the primary brain tumors. The mean survival of patients is 10-12 months. Conventional therapy of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy is largely palliative. Cytogenetically, karyotypes of glioblastomas are very complex with trisomy 7 and monosomy 10 as the most frequent abnormalities. A genetic alteration that is significantly more frequent in primary than in secondary glioblastomas, the latter arising from preceding low-grade gliomas, is epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) amplification, whereas TP-53 mutations are significantly more frequent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas derived there- from. We report the histological and genetic study of two glioblastomas, one case arising de novo and the other case arising 3 years after a previously diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma, with concurrent EGFR amplification and TP-53 mutation. These anomalies were initially deemed as mutually exclusive. However, a small percentage of cases have been found with both anomalies although at a significantly lower level than could be expected. We have analyzed these two cases cytogenetically and by molecular studies in order to detect additional alterations associated with this phenotype. Cytogenetically, both cases showed in common the monosomy of chromosomes 10 and 17. At the molecular level, a rare mutation of TP-53 was found in the secondary glioblastoma and hypermethylation of the promoter region of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) genes were observed in the primary and secondary glioblastoma, respectively.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17907599

He had history of head injury 5 years prior with CT evidence of bilateral basifrontal contusions. There was no contrast enhancement at the site of the contusions in an intervening CT scan done 18 months after the trauma. He underwent radical excision of the mass, and the histopathology was reported as glioblastoma multiforme. We formulated additional radiologic criteria for tumors that may present following trauma.

"""Integrative Modeling Reveals Annexin A2-mediated Epigenetic Control of Mesenchymal Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are characterized by transcriptionally distinct subtypes, but despite possible clinical relevance, their regulation remains poorly understood. The commonly used molecular classification systems for GBM all identify a subtype with high expression of mesenchymal marker transcripts, strongly associated with invasive growth. We used a comprehensive data-driven network modeling technique (augmented sparse inverse covariance selection, aSICS) to define separate genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptional regulators of glioblastoma subtypes. Our model identified Annexin A2 (ANXA2) as a novel methylation-controlled positive regulator of the mesenchymal subtype. Subsequent evaluation in two independent cohorts established ANXA2 expression as a prognostic factor that is dependent on ANXA2 promoter methylation. ANXA2 knockdown in primary glioblastoma stem cell-like cultures suppressed known mesenchymal master regulators, and abrogated cell proliferation and invasion. Our results place ANXA2 at the apex of a regulatory cascade that determines glioblastoma mesenchymal transformation and validate aSICS as a general methodology to uncover regulators of cancer subtypes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667176

Incorporating a multistep post-processing workflow, 20 radiomics features (Rads) were selected and a radiomics survival biomarker (RadSurv) was developed, proving highly efficient in risk stratification of gliomas (cut-off = 1.06), as well as lower-grade gliomas (cut-off = 0.64) and glioblastomas (cut-off = 1.80) through three fixed cut-off values.

Methods: Here, we used Cox regression and risk-score analysis to develop a cytokine-related gene signature in primary GBMs from the whole transcriptome sequencing profile of the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database (n=105). We also examined differences in immune cell phenotype and immune factor expression between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Results: Cytokine-related genes were ranked based on their ability to predict survival in the CGGA database. The six genes showing the strongest predictive value were CXCL10, IL17R, CCR2, IL17B, IL10RB, and CCL2. Patients with a high-risk score had poor overall survival and progression-free survival. Additionally, the high-risk group was characterized by increased mRNA expression of M2 microglia/macrophage markers and elevated levels of IL10 and TGFβ1.

Glioblastoma patients have poor prognosis, with an average survival period of approximately 14 mo after diagnosis. To date, there are a limited number of effective treatment methods for glioblastoma, and its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this article, we analyzed the key biomarkers and pathways in glioblastoma patients based on gene expression and DNA methylation datasets. The 60 hypomethylated/upregulated genes and 110 hypermethylated/downregulated genes were identified in GSE50923, GSE50161, and GSE116520 microarrays. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these methylated-differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in collagen fibril organization, chemical synaptic transmission, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and GABAergic synapse. The hub genes were screened from a protein-protein interaction network; in selected genes, increased NMB mRNA level was associated with favorable overall survival, while elevated CHI3L1, POSTN, S100A4, LOX, S100A11, IGFBP2, SLC12A5, VSNL1, and RGS4 mRNA levels were associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 expressions were negatively correlated with their corresponding methylation status. Furthermore, the receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 can also serve as highly specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for glioblastoma patients. Collectively, our study revealed the possible methylated-differentially expressed genes and associated pathways in glioblastoma and identified four DNA methylation-based biomarkers of glioblastoma.

"""Glioblastoma hijacks microglial gene expression to support tumor growth.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and lethal primary brain tumors. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, survey their environment and respond to pathogens, toxins, and tumors. Glioblastoma cells communicate with microglia, in part by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite the presence of large numbers of microglia in glioblastoma, the tumors continue to grow, and these neuroimmune cells appear incapable of keeping the tumor in check. To understand this process, we analyzed gene expression in microglia interacting with glioblastoma cells. Methods: We used RNASeq of isolated microglia to analyze the expression patterns of genes involved in key microglial functions in mice with glioblastoma. We focused on microglia that had taken up tumor-derived EVs and therefore were within and immediately adjacent to the tumor. Results: We show that these microglia have downregulated expression of genes involved in sensing tumor cells and tumor-derived danger signals, as well as genes used for tumor killing. In contrast, expression of genes involved in facilitating tumor spread was upregulated. These changes appear to be in part EV-mediated, since intracranial injection of EVs in normal mice led to similar transcriptional changes in microglia. We observed a similar microglial transcriptomic signature when we analyzed datasets from human patients with glioblastoma. Conclusion: Our data define a microgliaGlioblastoma specific phenotype, whereby glioblastomas have hijacked gene expression in the neuroimmune system to favor avoiding tumor sensing, suppressing the immune response, clearing a path for invasion, and enhancing tumor propagation.

One is characterized by p53 mutation and another is with wild-type p53 and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We analyzed the p53 status by a highly reliable yeast-based assay, overexpression of EGFR by immunohistochemistry, and their relations to clinical outcome along with other several clinical parameters, in a total of 42 patients with GMs. We found p53 mutations in 18 cases (43%) of 42 GMs and overexpression of EGFR in 16 cases (43%) of 37 GMs. The tumors with p53 mutation were associated with younger onset ages and longer survival. We also analyzed their survival and radiation sensitivity relative to p53 status, EGFR and other prognostic factors, including onset age, extent of surgery, post-operative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and location of tumor. Log-rank tests showed that younger onset ages (below 50 years; p < 0.0111), p53 mutation (p < 0.0005), superficial tumor location (p < 0.0026) and post operatives KPS (over 80%; p < 0.0147) correlated with longer survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the absence of p53 mutation (p < 0.0335) and the deep tumor location (p < 0.0297) as the independent, adverse prognostic factors. Tumor response to radiation was assessed by progression-free period (time to progression; TTP). A significant correlation was found between TTP and survival (p < 0.0001).

Methods: We examined leafy galls fraction F3.1.1 on cell proliferation, cell division and cytoskeletal disorganization of human cancer cell lines using time-lapse videomicroscopy imaging, combined with flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis. We determined the F3.1.1-fraction composition by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results: The leafy galls induced on tobacco by R. fascians yielded fraction F3.1.1 which inhibited proliferation of glioblastoma U373 cells with an IC50 of 4.5 µg/mL, F.3.1.1 was shown to increase cell division duration, cause nuclear morphological deformations and cell enlargement, and, at higher concentrations, karyokinesis defects leading to polyploidization and apoptosis. F3.1.1 consisted of a mixture of isomers belonging to the cembrenoids. The cellular defects induced by F3.1.1 were caused by a peculiar cytoskeletal disorganization, with the occurrence of fragmented tubulin and strongly organized microtubule aggregates within the same cell. Colchicine, paclitaxel, and cembrene also affected U373 cell proliferation and karyokinesis, but the induced microtubule rearrangement was very different from that provoked by F3.1.1.

ADH1A3 has been implicated in the regulation of stemness and radioresistance mediated by glioblastoma stem cells. Mechanisms by which ALDH1A3 promotes malignant progression of glioblastoma remain elusive posing a challenge for rationalization of ALDH1A3 targeting in glioblastoma, and it is also unclear how ALDH1A3 regulates glioblastoma cells stemness. Usage of different models with diverse genetic backgrounds and often unknown degree of stemness is one possible reason for discrepant views on the role of ALDH1A3 in glioblastoma stem cells. This study clarifies ALDH1A3 impacts on glioblastoma stem cells by modelling ALDH1A3 expression in an otherwise invariable genetic background with consideration of the impacts of inherent plasticity and proliferative changes associated with transitions between cell states. Our main finding is that ALDH1A3 exerts cell-state dependent impact on proliferation of glioblastoma stem cells. We provide evidence that ALDH1A3 augments radiation-induced inhibition of self-renewal and promotes the proliferation of differentiated GSC progenies.

Our understanding of tumor homeostasis is limited by a lack of genetic tools to selectively identify tumor states and fate transitions. Here, we use glioblastoma subtype signatures to construct synthetic genetic tracing cassettes and investigate tumor heterogeneity at cellular and molecular levels, in vitro and in vivo. Through synthetic locus control regions, we demonstrate that proneural glioblastoma is a hardwired identity, whereas mesenchymal glioblastoma is an adaptive and metastable cell state driven by proinflammatory and differentiation cues and DNA damage, but not hypoxia. Importantly, we discovered that innate immune cells divert glioblastoma cells to a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition that confers therapeutic resistance. Our synthetic genetic tracing methodology is simple, scalable, and widely applicable to study homeostasis in development and diseases. In glioblastoma, the method causally links distinct (micro)environmental, genetic, and pharmacologic perturbations and mesenchymal commitment. SIGNIFICANCE: Glioblastoma is heterogeneous and incurable. Here, we designed synthetic reporters to reflect the transcriptional output of tumor cell states and signaling pathways' activity. This method is generally applicable to study homeostasis in normal tissues and diseases.

Experimentally induced hypomethylation in mice promotes genomic instability and is sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis. Here, we report that global hypomethylation is common in primary human glioblastomas [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] and can affect up to an estimated 10 million CpG dinucleotides per haploid tumor genome. Demethylation involves satellite 2 (Sat2) pericentromeric DNA at chromosomes 1 and 16, the subtelomeric repeat sequence D4Z4 at chromosomes 4q and 10q, and interspersed Alu elements. Severe hypomethylation of Sat2 sequences is associated with copy number alterations of the adjacent euchromatin, suggesting that hypomethylation may be one factor predisposing to specific genetic alterations commonly occurring in GBMs. An additional apparent consequence of global hypomethylation is reactivation of the cancer-testis antigen MAGEA1 via promoter demethylation, but only in GBMs and GBM cell lines exhibiting a 5-methylcytosine content below a threshold of approximately 50%. Primary GBMs with significant hypomethylation tended to be heterozygous or homozygous for the low-functioning Val allele of the rate-limiting methyl group metabolism gene methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), or had a deletion encompassing this gene at 1p36. Tumors with severe genomic hypomethylation also had an elevated proliferation index and deletion of the MTHFR gene.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference of acetate metabolism between in glioblastomas with wild-type IDH and in those with IDH mutation by comparing the uptake of 14C-acetate using genetically engineered glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We established glioblastoma cells (U251) expressing IDH1 R132H and examined the cell uptake of [1-14C]acetate. Biodistribution studies and an autoradiographic study for U251 cell tumor-bearing mice (BALB/c-nu/nu) with or without the IDH1 mutation were performed 1 h after [1-14C]acetate administration.

Methods: This retrospective study included glioblastoma cases (n = 199) with known IDH mutation status and pre-operative MRI (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced T1W1 at minimum). Two neuroradiologists determined the following MRI metrics: (1) primary lobe of involvement (frontal or non-frontal); (2) presence/absence of contrast-enhancement; (3) presence/absence of necrosis; (4) presence/absence of fluid attenuation in the non-contrast-enhancing tumor (nCET); (5) maximum width of peritumoral edema (cm); (6) presence/absence of multifocal disease.

"""PTEN (MMAC1) mutations are frequent in primary glioblastomas (de novo) but not in secondary glioblastomas.""","""Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 is the most frequent genetic alteration associated with the evolution of malignant astrocytic tumors and it may involve several loci. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1) on chromosome 10q23 is mutated in approximately 30% of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV). In this study, we assessed the frequency of PTEN mutations in primary glioblastomas, which developed clinically de novo, and in secondary glioblastomas, which evolved from low-grade (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III). Nine of 28 (32%) primary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation and an additional case showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. This indicates that after overexpression/amplification of the EGF receptor, loss of PTEN function is the most common alteration in primary glioblastomas. In this series, 5 of 28 (18%) primary glioblastomas showed both a PTEN mutation and EGFR amplification. In contrast, only 1 of 25 (4%) secondary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation, and none of them showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. The secondary glioblastoma with a PTEN mutation developed from an anaplastic astrocytoma that already carried the mutation. The observation that secondary glioblastomas have a p53 mutation as a genetic hallmark but rarely contain a PTEN mutation supports the concept that primary and secondary glioblastomas develop differently on a genetic level.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9690672
"""Glioblastoma-educated mesenchymal stem-like cells promote glioblastoma infiltration via extracellular matrix remodelling in the tumour microenvironment.""","""Background: The biological function of mesenchymal stem-like cells (MSLCs), a type of stromal cells, in the regulation of the tumour microenvironment is unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and crosstalk between MSLCs and glioblastomas (GBMs) in tumour progression. Methods: In vitro and in vivo co-culture systems were used to analyze ECM remodelling and GBM infiltration. In addition, clinical databases, samples from patients with GBM and a xenografted mouse model of GBM were used. Results: Previous studies have shown that the survival of patients with GBM from whom MSLCs could be isolated is substantially shorter than that of patients from whom MSLCs could not be isolated. Therefore, we determined the correlation between changes in ECM-related gene expression in MSLC-isolatable patients with that in MSLC non-isolatable patients using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We found that lysyl oxidase (LOX) and COL1A1 expressions increased in MSLCs via GBM-derived clusters of differentiation 40 ligand (CD40L). Mechanistically, MSLCs are reprogrammed by the CD40L/CD40/NFκB2 signalling axis to build a tumour infiltrative microenvironment involving collagen crosslinking. Importantly, blocking of CD40L by a neutralizing antibody-suppressed LOX expression and ECM remodelling, decreasing GBM infiltration in mouse xenograft models. Clinically, high expression of CD40L, clusters of differentiation 40 (CD40) and LOX correlated with poor survival in patients with glioma. This indicated that GBM-educated MSLCs promote GBM infiltration via ECM remodelling in the tumour microenvironment. Conclusion: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the pro-infiltrative tumour microenvironment produced by GBM-educated MSLCs and highlight a potential therapeutic target that can be used for suppressing GBM infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35908277
"""FISH 1p/19q deletion/imbalance for molecular subclassification of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most malignant and frequent of the glial tumors. A minor fraction of glioblastoma may contain areas showing oligodendroglioma-like tumor cell differentiation. Several authors have described such tumors as glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component (GBMO). GBMO may represent the ultimate level of malignancy in the oligodendroglial lineage. The oligodendroglial component and combined loss of chromosomal arm 1p and 19q in glioblastoma indicate increased survival. In our study, we analyzed 1p and 19q status in a series of 12 glioblastoma and 8 oligodendroglial tumors using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin-embedded tissues. In each case, hybridization status was classified as deletion, imbalance, polysomy, amplification, or normal pattern. Other genetic alterations such as CDKN2A (p16), RB, and EGFR were also assessed. On histological review, 2 of 12 glioblastoma (16.7%) were classified as GBMO. Chromosome 1p/19q deletion was detected in 3 of 12 glioblastomas (25%). In contrast, all 8 oligodendroglial tumors showed 1p/19q deletion. All GBMO had 19q deletion with imbalance, whereas 1 of 10 ordinary glioblastoma (10%) demonstrated 19q deletion with imbalance. All but 1 ordinary glioblastoma (90%) showed CDKN2A (p16) deletion, but no GBMO displayed this alteration.

Despite technological advances in surgical management, combined regimens of radiotherapy with new generation chemotherapy, the median survival for these patients is 14.6 months. This is largely due to a highly deregulated tumour genome with opportunistic deletion of tumour suppressor genes, amplification and/or mutational hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors. The net result of these genetic changes is augmented survival pathways and systematic defects in the apoptosis signalling machinery. The only randomised, controlled phase II trial conducted targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling with the small molecule inhibitor, erlotinib, has showed no therapeutic benefit. Survival signalling and apoptosis resistance in GBMs can be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Targeting increased survival is unlikely to be efficacious without at the same time targeting apoptosis resistance. We have critically reviewed the literature regarding survival and apoptosis signalling in GBM, and highlighted experimental, preclinical and recent clinical trials attempting to target these pathways. Combined therapies simultaneously targeting apoptosis and survival signalling defects might shift the balance from tumour growth stasis to cytotoxic therapeutic responses that might be associated with greater therapeutic benefits.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515495

Results: Missense mutations were observed in 18 cases (11.2%), and 4 novel mutations were detected, including G178C, A271C, C818A and C1860G. Mutations of the EGFR extracellular domain were not associated with overall survival or with age at onset of the disease. In contrast, the EGFR extracellular domain mutations were significantly associated with patients' gender. Indeed, 15 mutations were observed in men vs. 3 in women (P < 0.05). EGFR extracellular domain mutations were also strongly associated with EGFR amplification (P < 0.0001).

Thirty-three days after starting immunochemoradiotherapy (ACNU, VCR, IFN -beta, radiation), she developed neutropenia (1,000/microliters). Administration of G-CSF at doses of 125-250 micrograms/day led to an increase of peripheral neutrophil counts. Eleven days later, the patient developed sudden severe respiratory failure and cyanosis with worsening of lung shadows. Blood gas levels on room air were PaO2 49.3mmHg, PaCO2 28.0mmHg, and pH 7.46. At this time, her neutrophil count had risen to 26,080/microliters. LDH and alpha - HBD had also increased to 1,439 IU/l and 1,117IU/l respectively. Chest radiograph and CT scan demonstrated interstitial pneumonia. After treatment with methyl prednisolone, her respiratory symptoms were gradually resolved.

"""Genetic pathways to primary and secondary glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant human brain tumor. The prognosis remains very poor, with most patients dying within 1 year after diagnosis. Primary and secondary glioblastoma constitute distinct disease subtypes, affecting patients of different age and developing through different genetic pathways. The majority of cases (>90%) are primary glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo, without clinical or histological evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion. They affect mainly the elderly and are genetically characterized by loss of heterozygosity 10q (70% of cases), EGFR amplification (36%), p16(INK4a) deletion (31%), and PTEN mutations (25%). Secondary glioblastomas develop through progression from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma and manifest in younger patients. In the pathway to secondary glioblastoma, TP53 mutations are the most frequent and earliest detectable genetic alteration, already present in 60% of precursor low-grade astrocytomas. The mutation pattern is characterized by frequent G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites. During progression to glioblastoma, additional mutations accumulate, including loss of heterozygosity 10q25-qter ( approximately 70%), which is the most frequent genetic alteration in both primary and secondary glioblastomas. Primary and secondary glioblastomas also differ significantly in their pattern of promoter methylation and in expression profiles at RNA and protein levels.

Thereby, cancer stem cells have the intrinsic potential for tumor initiation, tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor relapse after therapy. Both genetic and epigenetic alterations are attributed to the formation of multiple tumor types. This review is focused on how epigenetic dynamics involving DNA methylation and DNA oxidations are implicated in breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme.

"""Retinoblastoma protein regulates the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, and favors glioblastoma resistance to etoposide.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are devastating tumors of the central nervous system, with a poor prognosis of 1-year survival. This results from a high resistance of GBM tumor cells to current therapeutic options, including etoposide (VP-16). Understanding resistance mechanisms may thus open new therapeutic avenues. VP-16 is a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes replication fork stalling and, ultimately, the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptotic cell death. Autophagy has been identified as a VP-16 treatment resistance mechanism in tumor cells. Retinoblastoma protein (RB) is a classical tumor suppressor owing to its role in G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, but recent data have shown RB participation in many other cellular functions, including, counterintuitively, negative regulation of apoptosis. As GBMs usually display an amplification of the EGFR signaling involving the RB protein pathway, we questioned whether RB might be involved in mechanisms of resistance of GBM cells to VP-16. We observed that RB silencing increased VP-16-induced DNA double-strand breaks and p53 activation. Moreover, RB knockdown increased VP-16-induced apoptosis in GBM cell lines and cancer stem cells, the latter being now recognized essential to resistance to treatments and recurrence. We also showed that VP-16 treatment induced autophagy, and that RB silencing impaired this process by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Taken together, our data suggest that RB silencing causes a blockage on the VP-16-induced autophagic flux, which is followed by apoptosis in GBM cell lines and in cancer stem cells. Therefore, we show here, for the first time, that RB represents a molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis, and a resistance marker in GBM, a discovery with potential importance for anticancer treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23949216

Study design: In paraffin sections of surgical specimens from 71 primary resected glioblastomas, tumor cell nuclei in the region with the highest proliferative activity (Ki-67 immunostaining) were investigated morphometrically. Shape variables (roundness factor, Fourier amplitudes) and nuclear area were measured. Additionally, the numerical density of Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei was estimated. Differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from paraffin sections of the same tumor area. The signals for the EGFR gene and IFN gamma reference gene were quantified densitometrically. Results: Cases with distinct EGFR gene amplification (EGFR/IFN ratios > 5) revealed significantly lower mean values for several Fourier amplitudes, indicating a more regular nuclear shape when compared with cases without evidence of EGFR gene amplification (EGFR/IFN-ratios < or = 1). The Ki-67 index and nuclear area showed no significant differences between these groups. Although a large variation in nuclear morphology was observed for cases without evidence of EGFR gene amplification, discriminant analysis based on morphometric variables provided a good separation of these cases from cases with distinct EGFR gene amplification, with a high percentage of statistically correct reclassified cases.

Reliable animal models are critical for defining mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. First we analyzed the immune subpopulations present in rat C6 gliomas. Using flow cytometry we determined kinetics of infiltration of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes into glioma-bearing brains.

Transcriptomic analyses of glioma-bearing hemispheres revealed overexpression of invasion and immunosuppression-related genes, reflecting the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Microglia, sorted as CD11b+CD45low cells from gliomas, displayed the pro-invasive and immunosuppressive type of activation. Accumulation of Th and Treg cells combined with the reduced presence of Tc lymphocytes in rat gliomas may result in the lack of effective anti-tumor responses.

Methods: Fifty-eight patients with deep situated malignant gliomas, 28 anaplastic astrocytomas(AA) and 30 glioblastomas (GBM), aged from 7 to 70 years, were analyzed. The mean volume of tumor was 12.08 cm3, and mean prescription dose for linac radiosurgery was 19.42 Gy. The results were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression. Results: There were 44.8% of the tumors shrank. Median tumor local control interval was 10 months(15 months for AA and 9 months for GBM). Tumor local control probability was 37.9% for 1 year and 10.3% for 2 years. Median survival was 22.5 months for AA and 13 months for GBM and 15 months for all patients. The survival probability was 79.3% at 1 year and 20.6% at 2 years. Isocenter numbers and tumor volume were the prognostic factors for tumor control, but conformity index was prognostic factor for survival as determined by Cox regression analysis.

Histological control was carried out in each case. Results: Significant differences were found in the levels of urokinase (uPA), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and PAI-1 inhibitor between glioblastomas and breast cancer metastases and the histologically unaltered (relatively intact) tissue around meningioma lesions (p≤0.05 in all cases). The levels of uPA-AG and uPA-act in meningioma were higher than those in the relatively intact tissue, while the levels of both tPA forms were reduced.

"""Matrix-degrading proteases ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (disintegrins and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs 4 and 5) are expressed in human glioblastomas.""","""Brain tumors, in particular glioblastomas, have a high morbidity and mortality, mainly due to their invasive nature. A prerequisite for this invasiveness is cell migration based on increased expression of proteases digesting the extracellular matrix. Brevican, an important extracellular proteoglycan that is upregulated in glioblastomas, can be degraded by certain proteases. We demonstrate that in human glioblastomas secretory proteases like ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (aggrecanases 1 and 2; ADAMTS = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) are expressed on the mRNA and protein levels in considerable amounts. Real-time RT-PCR shows a higher levels of ADAMTS4 and 5 expressions in glioblastomas in situ, compared to cultured human glioblastoma cells. The upregulation of these proteases in vivo by cytokines may explain this difference. In vitro, transforming growth factor-beta induces ADAMTS4, but less ADAMTS5, and interleukin-1beta ADAMTS5, but not ADAMTS4. As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in situ, ADAMTS5 expression is confined to proliferating glioblastoma cells of surgical tumor sections and with lower intensity to astroglial cells in normal brain sections, as opposed to brevican. In vitro, glioblastoma-derived ADAMTS5 degrades recombinant human brevican to several smaller fragments. Our results show that ADAMTS4 and 5 are upregulated on proliferating glioblastoma cells and these proteases may contribute to their invasive potential.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16003758

"""Glioblastoma hijacks neuronal mechanisms for brain invasion.""","""Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a Lévy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma's dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35914528

This has called into question the existence of an IDH-wildtype lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) category, and the cIMPACT-NOW study group has suggested 3 molecular features which, if present, warrant upgrading IDH-wildtype LGA to glioblastoma: EGFR amplification, 7+/10-, and TERT promoter mutation. Herein, we evaluate the clinical, histologic, and molecular features of IDH-wildtype low-grade astrocytomas, defined here as infiltrative adult astrocytoma lacking histologic features of glioblastoma (microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis), IDH1/2 mutation, and all 3 of the cIMPACT-NOW update 3 factors. Compared with their counterparts with cIMPACT-NOW features of glioblastoma (LGA-C+; n = 108), IDH-wildtype LGAs lacking these features (LGA-C0; n = 36) occur in significantly younger patients, are more frequently WHO grade II, have less total copy number variation distributed across the entire genome, less frequent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, less frequent PTEN and PIK3CA alterations, and more frequent NF1 alterations.

We analyzed clinically relevant molecular aberrations suggestive of response to therapies in 1035 GBM tumors. Our analysis revealed mutations in 39 genes of 48 tested. IHC revealed expression of PD-L1 in 19% and PD-1 in 46%. MGMT-methylation was seen in 43%, EGFRvIII in 19% and 1p19q co-deletion in 2%. TP53 mutation was associated with concurrent mutations, while IDH1 mutation was associated with MGMT-methylation and TP53 mutation and was mutually exclusive of EGFRvIII mutation. Distinct biomarker profiles were seen in GBM compared with WHO grade III astrocytoma, suggesting different biology and potentially different treatment approaches. Analysis of 17 metachronous paired tumors showed frequent biomarker changes, including MGMT-methylation and EGFR aberrations, indicating the need for a re-biopsy for tumor profiling to direct subsequent therapy. MGMT-methylation, PR and TOPO1 appeared as significant prognostic markers in sub-cohorts of GBM defined by age.

"""SAMSN1 is highly expressed and associated with a poor survival in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Objectives: To study the expression pattern and prognostic significance of SAMSN1 in glioma. Methods: Affymetrix and Arrystar gene microarray data in the setting of glioma was analyzed to preliminarily study the expression pattern of SAMSN1 in glioma tissues, and Hieratical clustering of gene microarray data was performed to filter out genes that have prognostic value in malignant glioma. Survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier estimates stratified by SAMSN1 expression was then made based on the data of more than 500 GBM cases provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. At last, we detected the expression of SAMSN1 in large numbers of glioma and normal brain tissue samples using Tissue Microarray (TMA). Survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier estimates in each grade of glioma was stratified by SAMSN1 expression. Multivariate survival analysis was made by Cox proportional hazards regression models in corresponding groups of glioma. Results: With the expression data of SAMSN1 and 68 other genes, high-grade glioma could be classified into two groups with clearly different prognoses. Gene and large sample tissue microarrays showed high expression of SAMSN1 in glioma particularly in GBM. Survival analysis based on the TCGA GBM data matrix and TMA multi-grade glioma dataset found that SAMSN1 expression was closely related to the prognosis of GBM, either PFS or OS (P<0.05). Multivariate survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards regression models confirmed that high expression of SAMSN1 was a strong risk factor for PFS and OS of GBM patients. Conclusion: SAMSN1 is over-expressed in glioma as compared with that found in normal brains, especially in GBM. High expression of SAMSN1 is a significant risk factor for the progression free and overall survival of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24278465

Definitions of gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) are based on the confrontation of clinical presentation (age, performance status, neurologic symptoms...), histological type and imaging aspects. For glioblastoma multiform, the GTV can be defined by the area of contrast enhancement observed on the CT scan or MRI. Definition of the CTV can be more difficult and have to take into account the risk of presence of isolated malignant cells in the oedema surrounding the tumor or in the adjacent brain structures. The classical concept of GTV plus a safety margin of 2 cm around is discussed with a CTV containing at least all the oedematous area and eventually adjacent brain structures (nuclei, corpus callosum or other long associative fibers...). For low grade astrocytoma, the definition of GTV can be difficult if the tumoral infiltration is diffuse without nodular visible tumor. CTV corresponds to at least T2 MRI hypersignal area when visible. For postoperative tumor, technical considerations are important for the detection of residual tumor.

To date, there are no studies examining the prospective usage of validated PC assessment tools as patient reported outcome measures for GBM patients. Methods: GBM patients' PC issues were assessed from diagnosis to death or for at least 12 months every 7 weeks (±8 days) using semi-structured interviews and the Hospice and Palliative Care Evaluation (HOPE, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 17 items) and the Palliative Outcome Scale (POS, 11 items). Data from patients who died within 12 months of the last patient's enrollment were evaluated using summarizing content analysis, visual graphical analysis (VGA), and linear mixed models for repeated measures. Results: Nineteen of 33 patients screened were enrolled; two dropped out and four were still alive at the end of the study. The remaining 13 were assessed at 59 points until death (time range 4-68 weeks; 1-10 contacts per patient; assessment: self, 33; joint, 8; external, 18). VGA of the HOPE and POS data, including all 1,652 assessed item data, showed consistent trajectory profiles for 14 of 28 items: 10 were increasing (meaning symptom worsening) and comprised predominantly psychosocial issues and care dependency. Type of assessment partly interacted with time, however, not qualitatively so. Analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed delayed interactions with PC/hospice services and numerous neuropsychiatric problems not detected by HOPE and POS.

"""Microglia induce an interferon-stimulated gene expression profile in glioblastoma and increase glioblastoma resistance to temozolomide.""","""Aims: Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumour. Even with standard treatment comprising surgery followed by radiation and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains incurable. Almost all patients with glioblastoma relapse owing to various intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms of the tumour cells. Glioblastomas are densely infiltrated with tumour-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs). These immune cells affect the tumour cells in experimental studies and are associated with poor patient survival in clinical studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of microglia on glioblastoma chemo-resistance. Methods: We co-cultured patient-derived glioblastoma spheroids with microglia at different TMZ concentrations and analysed cell death. In addition, we used RNA sequencing to explore differentially expressed genes after co-culture. Immunostaining was used for validation. Results: Co-culture experiments showed that microglia significantly increased TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cells. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of a clear interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression signature in the glioblastoma cells after co-culture with microglia, including genes such as IFI6, IFI27, BST2, MX1 and STAT1. This ISG expression signature is linked to STAT1 signalling, which was confirmed by immunostaining. The ISG expression profile observed in glioblastoma cells with enhanced TMZ resistance corresponded to the interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) described in different solid cancers. Conclusions: Here, we show that the IRDS signature, linked to chemo-resistance in other cancers, can be induced in glioblastoma by microglia.

"""Subclassification of newly diagnosed glioblastomas through an immunohistochemical approach.""","""Molecular signatures in Glioblastoma (GBM) have been described that correlate with clinical outcome and response to therapy. The Proneural (PN) and Mesenchymal (MES) signatures have been identified most consistently, but others including Classical (CLAS) have also been reported. The molecular signatures have been detected by array techniques at RNA and DNA level, but these methods are costly and cannot take into account individual contributions of different cells within a tumor. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether subclasses of newly diagnosed GBMs could be assessed and assigned by application of standard pathology laboratory procedures. 123 newly diagnosed GBMs were analyzed for the tumor cell expression of 23 pre-identified proteins and EGFR amplification, together allowing for the subclassification of 65% of the tumors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based profiling was found to be analogous to transcription-based profiling using a 9-gene transcriptional signature for PN and MES subclasses. Based on these data a novel, minimal IHC-based scheme for subclass assignment for GBMs is proposed. Positive staining for IDH1R132H can be used for PN subclass assignment, high EGFR expression for the CLAS subtype and a combined high expression of PTEN, VIM and/or YKL40 for the MES subclass. The application of the proposed scheme was evaluated in an independent tumor set, which resulted in similar subclass assignment rates as those observed in the training set. The IHC-based subclassification scheme proposed in this study therefore could provide very useful in future studies for stratification of individual patient samples.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546404

MGMT promoter methylation was assessed by qualitative methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), semiquantitative methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction (SQ-MSP), and pyrosequencing, while MGMT expression was measured at the RNA level by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (IHC). MGMT promoter methylation as evaluated by MSP, SQ-MSP, and pyrosequencing was significantly correlated with overall survival. The best predictive value was obtained by pyrosequencing of one specific CpG position. Overall survival was 14 and 25 months for patients with percentages of methylation below and above the median, respectively. In contrast, MGMT status determined by Q-RT-PCR and IHC showed little or no correlation with overall survival, respectively.

"""Selenoprotein P expression in glioblastoma as a regulator of ferroptosis sensitivity: preservation of GPX4 via the cycling-selenium storage.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly brain tumors; however, its current therapeutic strategies are limited. Selenoprotein P (SeP; SELENOP, encoded by the SELENOP gene) is a unique selenium-containing protein that exhibits high expression levels in astroglia. SeP is thought to be associated with ferroptosis sensitivity through the induction of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) via selenium supplementation. In this study, to elucidate the role of SeP in GBM, we analyzed its expression in GBM patients and found that SeP expression levels were significantly higher when compared to healthy subjects. Knock down of SeP in cultured GBM cells resulted in a decrease in GPX1 and GPX4 protein levels. Under the same conditions, cell death caused by RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer, was enhanced, however this enhancement was canceled by supplementation of selenite. These results indicate that SeP expression contributes to preserving GPX and selenium levels in an autocrine/paracrine manner, i.e., SeP regulates a dynamic cycling-selenium storage system in GBM. We also confirmed the role of SeP expression in ferroptosis sensitivity using patient-derived primary GBM cells.

Pre-operative MRIs of new glioblastoma patients, consisting of at least FLAIR and T1-weighted post-contrast sequences, were reviewed by a neuroradiologist based primarily on the VASARI feature set. IDH1 mutation testing was performed on all patients using immunohistochemistry. 153 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom five had IDH1 mutations (3.3%). A frontal lobe location had equivalent frequency in both the IDH1-mutated and IDH1-wildtype cohorts (p=1.000). Three (60%) of the IDH1-mutated tumours had >33% nCET, compared to 21% of IDH1-wildtype (p=0.073). 12 tumours had a frontal lobe epicentre and >33% nCET, all being IDH1-wildtype. All five IDH1-mutated tumours had either a frontal lobe epicentre or >33% nCET, but none had both these features. Our results question the strength of the association between frontal lobe glioblastomas with substantial nCET and IDH1 mutations, as these features are also relatively frequent in IDH1-wildtype tumours, which are much more common. MRI is thus more useful for ruling out an IDH1 mutation rather than strongly suggesting its presence: if a particular glioblastoma does not have a frontal lobe epicentre and has less than 33% nCET, it can be predicted to be IDH1-wildtype with a high degree of confidence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28214089

Radiological imaging revealed a left temporal tumor with dural inflation and erosion of the petrous bone and superior semicircular duct. The surgery involved total resection of the tumor and resurfacing of the gap in the superior canal. The histopathological examination revealed World Health Trade Organization IV glioblastoma.

Immunohistochemistry was performed for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS2, and hMSH6 in cases showing MSI. Sequence and promoter methylation status of hMLH1 were analyzed in the case of a decreased hMLH1 protein expression as well. To further investigate MSI(+) GBMs we carried out studies of LOH at selected chromosome regions, EGFR amplification, and sequence of p53 and PTEN. Results: MSI was observed in six GBMs (5.5%) and it was more frequent in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (18.8% vs. 3.2%). MMR protein staining was positive in all MSI(+) GBMs except in one case, which showed an aberrant expression of hMLH1 and hPMS2 without hMLH1 inactivation. Among MSI(+) GBMs, one tumor corresponded to the GBM molecular type 1 (p53 mutation, no EGFR amplification), another tumor to type 2 (wild-type p53, EGFR amplification), and four tumors to neither type (wild-type p53, no EGFR amplification). None of the six tumors carried a PTEN mutation. Conclusions: MSI in GBM might be caused by inactivation of minor MMR genes rather than by a deficiency of hMLH1 or hMSH2 and it appears not to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of these tumors.

Clinically applicable concentrations of violacein were demonstrated to inhibit the proliferative capacity of tumor cell lines according to a crystal violet proliferation assay. The underlying mechanism was the promotion of apoptotic cell death, as indicated by poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling determined by western blot analysis.

The anti-malignant properties of violacein in the present study were further demonstrated by its inhibitory effects on brain tumor cell migration, specifically glioblastomas, one of the most invasive and therapeutically resistant neoplasms in the clinic. Additionally, solid tumors examined in the present study displayed differential cellular responses and sensitivities to violacein as observed by morphologically induced cellular changes that contributed to its anti-migratory properties.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 mutations are common in World Health Organization (WHO) grades II and III gliomas, but rare in primary glioblastomas, and associated with longer survival. Experimental design: We compared clinical and molecular characteristics of 69 patients with centrally confirmed glioblastoma and survival >36 months (LTS-36), including 33 patients surviving >60 months (LTS-60), with 257 patients surviving <36 months. MGMT promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletions, EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, and IDH1/2 mutations were determined by standard techniques. Results: The rate of IDH1/2 mutations in LTS-36 patients was 34% (23 of 67 patients) as opposed to 4.3% in controls (11 of 257 patients). Long-term survivors with IDH1/2-mutant glioblastomas were younger, had almost no EGFR amplifications, but exhibited more often 1p/19q codeletions and TP53 mutations than LTS patients with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastomas. Long-term survivors with IDH1/2 wild-type showed no distinguishing features from other patients with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastomas except for a higher rate of MGMT promoter methylation. Similarly, among 11 patients with IDH1/2-mutant glioblastomas without long-term survival, the only difference to IDH1/2-mutant long-term survivors was less-frequent MGMT promoter methylation. Compared with LTS-36 patients, LTS-60 patients had less frequently TP53 mutations and radiotherapy alone as initial treatment. Conclusions: IDH1/2 mutations define a subgroup of tumors of LTS patients that exhibit molecular characteristics of WHO grade II/III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. Determinants of LTS with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastomas, which exhibit typical molecular features of primary glioblastomas, beyond MGMT promoter methylation, remain to be identified.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918605
"""SDF-1 Blockade Enhances Anti-VEGF Therapy of Glioblastoma and Can Be Monitored by MRI.""","""Despite the approval of antiangiogenic therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, survival benefits are still limited. One of the resistance mechanisms for antiangiogenic therapy is the induction of hypoxia and subsequent recruitment of macrophages by stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1α (CXCL-12). In this study, we tested whether olaptesed pegol (OLA-PEG, NOX-A12), a novel SDF-1α inhibitor, could reverse the recruitment of macrophages and potentiate the antitumor effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. We also tested whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent could provide early information on macrophage blockade. Orthotopic human G12 glioblastomas in nude mice and rat C6 glioblastomas were employed as the animal models. These were treated with bevacizumab or B-20, both anti-VEGF antibodies. Rats were MR imaged with ferumoxytol for macrophage detection. Tumor hypoxia and SDF-1α expression were elevated by VEGF blockade. Adding OLA-PEG to bevacizumab or B-20 significantly prolonged the survival of rodents bearing intracranial GBM compared with anti-VEGF therapy alone. Intratumoral CD68+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) were increased by VEGF blockade, but the combination of OLA-PEG + VEGF blockade markedly lowered TAM levels compared with VEGF blockade alone. MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent noninvasively demonstrated macrophage reduction in OLA-PEG + anti-VEGF-treated rats compared with VEGF blockade alone. In conclusion, inhibition of SDF-1 with OLA-PEG inhibited the recruitment of TAMs by VEGF blockage and potentiated its antitumor efficacy in GBM. Noninvasive MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent provides early information on the effect of OLA-PEG in reducing TAMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940247
"""Differential expression of MHC class II molecules by microglia and neoplastic astroglia: relevance for the escape of astrocytoma cells from immune surveillance.""","""There is increasing evidence that microglia serve as antigen presenters in the human CNS. Although the occurrence of MHC class II immunoreactive cells has been reported in astrocytic gliomas, the relative contribution of microglia to this cell population has not been studied in detail. Using computer-assisted image analysis, we have investigated the expression of MHC class II molecules and of the microglia/macrophage markers Ki-MIP, RCA-1, KP1 and iba1, in 97 astrocytic gliomas comprising all WHO grades to answer the question whether there is a correlation between tumour grade and the number of MHC class II positive microglia/macrophage profiles. Microglia expressing MHC class II were common in astrocytomas and anaplastic astrocytomas but rare in pilocytic tumours although there was significant variation within each group. MHC class II immunoreactivity was reduced in highly cellular areas of glioblastomas where large numbers of cells expressing macrophage markers were still present. Thus, there was no simple relationship between tumour grade and microglial/macrophage MHC class II expression. In addition, up to 55% of astrocytic gliomas contained MHC class II immunoreactive tumour cells. Microglia but not tumour cells were found to express the BB1/B7 costimulator. We conclude that microglia in astrocytic gliomas are well equipped to function as antigen presenting cells. Yet, neoplastic astroglia appear to acquire the capacity to downregulate microglial MHC class II expression and, at the same time, may induce T-cell clonal anergy through aberrant expression of MHC class II molecules.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9775395
"""Genetic Alterations of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Glioblastoma: The Usefulness of Immunohistochemistry.""","""Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification is one of the common alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is frequently associated with EGFRvIII mutation. To evaluate the correlation between EGFR overexpression, gene amplification, and EGFRvIII mutation, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization by Vysis LSI EGFR/CEP7 dual color probe, and polymerase chain reaction studies in 76 patients diagnosed with glioblastomas (67 IDH-wildtype and 9 IDH-mutant). EGFR expression was scored ranging from 0 to 3+. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out with primers specific for EGFRvIII and EGFR wildtype. In addition, we evaluated the impact of EGFR status on prognosis. EGFR gene amplifications and EGFRvIII mutations were identified in 30.3% and 15.5% of all cases, respectively. All the EGFR-amplified or EGFRvIII mutant cases were IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and tested positive with IHC. The sensitivity and specificity of EGFR IHC predicting EGFR gene amplification status were 100.0% and 46.5%, respectively. The EGFR-amplified cases tended to show more intense immunostaining (3+) in a considerable number of tumor cells (≥50%). Survival analyses of 37 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients revealed that none of the EGFR alterations significantly affected prognosis. EGFR IHC displayed high sensitivity and low specificity in predicting EGFR gene amplification, and interpretation of IHC results is a challenge. Therefore, EGFR IHC represents a possible screening tool for evaluation of EGFR gene amplification in clinical neuropathology, and both the intensity and proportion score facilitate interpretation of EGFR IHC.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29912767

"""Immune genes are associated with human glioblastoma pathology and patient survival.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Several recent transcriptomic studies in GBM have identified different signatures involving immune genes associated with GBM pathology, overall survival (OS) or response to treatment. Methods: In order to clarify the immune signatures found in GBM, we performed a co-expression network analysis that grouped 791 immune-associated genes (IA genes) in large clusters using a combined dataset of 161 GBM specimens from published databases. We next studied IA genes associated with patient survival using 3 different statistical methods. We then developed a 6-IA gene risk predictor which stratified patients into two groups with statistically significantly different survivals. We validated this risk predictor on two other Affymetrix data series, on a local Agilent data series, and using RT-Q-PCR on a local series of GBM patients treated by standard chemo-radiation therapy. Results: The co-expression network analysis of the immune genes disclosed 6 powerful modules identifying innate immune system and natural killer cells, myeloid cells and cytokine signatures. Two of these modules were significantly enriched in genes associated with OS. We also found 108 IA genes linked to the immune system significantly associated with OS in GBM patients. The 6-IA gene risk predictor successfully distinguished two groups of GBM patients with significantly different survival (OS low risk: 22.3 months versus high risk: 7.3 months; p < 0.001). Patients with significantly different OS could even be identified among those with known good prognosis (methylated MGMT promoter-bearing tumor) using Agilent (OS 25 versus 8.1 months; p < 0.01) and RT-PCR (OS 21.8 versus 13.9 months; p < 0.05) technologies. Interestingly, the 6-IA gene risk could also distinguish proneural GBM subtypes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the immune signatures found in previous GBM genomic analyses and suggests the involvement of immune cells in GBM biology. The robust 6-IA gene risk predictor should be helpful in establishing prognosis in GBM patients, in particular in those with a proneural GBM subtype, and even in the well-known good prognosis group of patients with methylated MGMT promoter-bearing tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22980038
"""Predictive factors of human cytomegalovirus reactivation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with chemoradiotherapy.""","""The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpes virus which infects 40 to 99% of the population. HCMV reactivation may occur in the context of immunosuppression and can induce significant morbidities. Several cases of HCMV infections or HCMV reactivation have thus been reported in glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with radio(chemo)therapy. With the aim to identify the main risk factors associated with HCMV reactivation, we reviewed all patients treated for a newly diagnosed GBM in our institution from October 2013 to December 2015. Age, sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), serological HCMV status, and steroid doses were recorded at the start and 1 month after the end of radiotherapy (RT). Within the 103 patients analyzed, 34 patients (33%) had an initial negative serology for HCMV, and none of them developed a seroconversion after treatment. Among patients with positive HCMV IgG (n = 69), 16 patients (23%) developed a viremia at one point during treatment. Age (> 60 years), steroid intake, and ALC (< 1500/mm3) before RT were correlated with HCMV reactivation. HCMV viremia was associated with neurological decline 1 month after chemoradiotherapy but progression-free survival was not impacted. A shorter overall survival was seen in these patients when compared with the others, but this could be biased by the older age in this subgroup. HCMV reactivation needs to be sought in case of a neurological decline during RT especially in older patients treated with steroids and low lymphocytes counts.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33405205

The minimal observation period was 5 years after operation. According to multivariate correlation and regression tree (CART) analysis grading was the prime prognostic factor (grade II vs. anaplastic tumours, p < 0.00001). Grade II oligodendrogliomas were further divided into tumours with and without TP53 mutations (p < 0.05) whereas anaplastic tumours were subdivided according to age (p < 0.05, cut off at 57 years) and p53 protein accumulation (p < 0.05, cut off at 2%, age 57 years). Ki-67 labelling index correlated highly significantly with grading but had no independent prognostic relevance in CART analysis. Accumulation of wild-type p53 protein was not related to bcl-2 expression, a co-expression of p53 and bcl-2 was found at similar frequencies in tumours with or without TP53 mutations (4/12 vs. 3/11). Since accumulation of wild-type and mutant p53 are both associated with a poor prognosis, it is suggested to include immunohistochemical evaluation of p53 protein in routine diagnostics of oligodendrogliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10606174
"""Extraction of redox extracellular vesicles using exclusion-based sample preparation.""","""Studying specific subpopulations of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) could help reveal their role in cancer progression. In cancer, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) happens which results in lipid peroxidation with a major product of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Adduction by HNE causes alteration to the structure of proteins, leading to loss of function. Blebbing of EVs carrying these HNE-adducted proteins as a cargo or carrying HNE-adducted on EV membrane are methods for clearing these molecules by the cells. We have referred to these EVs as Redox EVs. Here, we utilize a surface tension-mediated extraction process, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), for the rapid and efficient isolation of intact Redox EVs, from a mixed population of EVs derived from human glioblastoma cell line LN18. After optimizing different parameters, two populations of EVs were analyzed, those isolated from the sample (Redox EVs) and those remaining in the original sample (Remaining EVs). Electron microscopic imaging was used to confirm the presence of HNE adducts on the outer leaflet of Redox EVs. Moreover, the population of HNE-adducted Redox EVs shows significantly different characteristics to those of Remaining EVs including smaller size EVs and a more negative zeta potential EVs. We further treated glioblastoma cells (LN18), radiation-resistant glioblastoma cells (RR-LN18), and normal human astrocytes (NHA) with both Remaining and Redox EV populations. Our results indicate that Redox EVs promote the growth of glioblastoma cells, likely through the production of H2O2, and cause injury to normal astrocytes. In contrast, Remaining EVs have minimal impact on the viability of both glioblastoma cells and NHA cells. Thus, isolating a subpopulation of EVs employing ESP-based immunoaffinity could pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of how subtypes of EVs, such as those containing HNE-adducted proteins, induce biological changes in the cells that take up these EVs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243301
"""Effect of adding temozolomide to radiation therapy on the incidence of pseudo-progression.""","""Recently, there has been greater awareness that combination radiation and temozolomide used to treat glioblastomas may cause increased contrast enhancement on the first post radiation MRI scan. However, this increased enhancement may stabilize or decrease over time and represent pseudo-progression (psPD) rather than true progressive disease. It has never been shown that this phenomenon is greater with combination therapy than radiation alone. To address this question, we reviewed MRI scans in glioblastoma patients treated with radiation alone versus patients treated with radiation and concomitant temozolomide and compared the frequency of psPD in the two groups. Eighteen of 47 patients (38%) treated with radiation alone demonstrated enlargement on their first post-radiation MRI scan and 11 of these 18 (61%) proved to have psPD as defined by no further enlargement on stable therapy for 3 months following radiation. Twenty-four of 45 patients (53%) treated with radiation and temozolomide had enlargement on their first post-radiation MRI scan and 13 of these 24 (54%) had psPD. Median overall survival (OS) in patients with psPD treated with radiation alone was 15.6 versus 12.8 months in those without psPD. Median OS in patients treated with radiation and concomitant temozolomide who had psPD was 24.4 versus 15.9 months in those who did not have psPD. We were unable to detect a difference in OS between the four groups. Presence of psPD, independent of treatment, was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P = 0.05) but not OS. psPD may be more common in combination therapy but most likely by a small margin.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19221865
"""FAP-specific PET signaling shows a moderately positive correlation with relative CBV and no correlation with ADC in 13 IDH wildtype glioblastomas.""","""Objectives: Targeting Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) is a new approach for glioblastoma imaging. In a recent pilot study glioblastomas showed elevated tracer uptake with high intratumoral heterogeneity in projection on the corresponding T2w/FLAIR and contrast enhanced MRI lesions. In this study, we correlated FAP-specific signaling with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) signals in MRI to further characterize the significance of FAP uptake. Methods: Clinical PET/CT scans of 13 glioblastoma patients were performed post i. v. administration of 68Ga-labelled-FAP-specific tracer molecules. PET- and corresponding MRI-scans were co-registrated. 3d volumetric segmentations were performed of T2w/FLAIR lesions and contrast enhancing lesions within co-registrated MRI slides. Signal intensity values of FAP-specific PET signaling, ADC and rCBV were analyzed for their pixel wise correlation in each patient. Pooled estimates of the correlation coefficients were calculated by using the Fisher z-transformation. Results: FAP-specific PET signals showed a moderately positive correlation with rCBV values which is more pronounced within the T2w/FLAIR lesion (pooled correlation 0,229) than in the contrast enhancing tumor region (pooled correlation 0.09). FAP-specific PET signals showed no correlation with ADC values. Conclusions: The moderately positive correlation of FAP-specific signals with rCBV values in MRI indicates that FAP-signaling is not independent from perfusion, but also does not only reflect intratumoral perfusion differences. The missing correlation of FAP-specific signals with ADC indicates that FAP-specific imaging does not reflect cell density, but the spot-like expression of FAP in glioblastomas.

Methods: We evaluated in 56 patients operated for glioblastoma their depressive and performance status in the preoperative and postoperative time. Moreover we analyzed the extent of surgery, the site and the size of lesions. Results: Median overall survival was 17 months. An age of ≥60 years (P<0.03), a preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status KPS≤70 (P=0.04), a subtotal tumor resection (P<0.001), a tumor size >5 cm (P=0.01), and no postoperative adjuvant treatment (P=0.01) were associated with the worst prognosis. Before surgery we found the presence of depression in 10 patients with a significative reduction of mean Back Depression Inventory scores after tumor resection (P=0.03). Finally, a KPS≤70 was significantly associated with an increased incidence of depression in the postoperative time. Conclusion: Tumor size, total resection and affective disorders were identified as predictors of survival in our series of patients with glioblastoma in addition to age and KPS score.

"""Clinical Neuropathology mini-review 6-2015: PD-L1: emerging biomarker in glioblastoma?""","""Programmed death 1 (PD-1, CD279) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274) are involved in generating tumor-associated immunosuppression by suppression of T-cell proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting these molecules are showing compelling activity against a variety of human cancers. PD-L1 expression has shown a positive association with response to PD-1 inhibition in noncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g., melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, and is discussed as a potential predictive biomarker for patient selection in these tumor types. This review summarizes current knowledge and potential clinical implications of PD-L1 expression in glioblastoma. At present, the following conclusions are drawn: (a) functional data support a role for PD-1/PD-L1 in tumor-associated immunosuppression in glioblastoma; (b) the incidence of PD-L1-expressing glioblastomas seems to be relatively high in comparison to other tumor types, however, the reported rates of glioblastomas with PD-L1 protein expression vary and range from 61 to 88%; (c) there is considerable variability in the methodology of PD-L1 assessment in glioblastoma across studies with heterogeneity in utilized antibodies, tissue sampling strategies, immunohistochemical staining protocols, cut-off definitions, and evaluated staining patterns; (d) there are conflicting data on the prognostic role and so far no data on the predictive role of PD-L1 gene and protein expression in glioblastoma. In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26501438

Autophagy is entitled as programmed cell death type II and studies imply that it is a comeback of cancer cells to innumerable anti-cancer therapies. To diminish the adverse consequences of chemotherapeutics, numerous herbs of natural origin have been retained in cancer treatments. Additionally, autophagy induction occurs via their tumor suppressive actions that could cause cell senescence and increase apoptosis-independent cell death. However, most of the drugs have poor solubility and thus nano drug delivery systems possess excessive potential to improve the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of encapsulated drugs.

Methods: Here we compare the IDH1 mutational status in 172 contrast-enhancing glioma patients with the invasion profile generated by a patient-specific mathematical model we developed based on MR imaging. Results: We show that IDH1-mutated contrast-enhancing gliomas were relatively more invasive than wild-type IDH1 for all 172 contrast-enhancing gliomas as well as the subset of 158 histologically confirmed glioblastomas. The appearance of this relatively increased, model-predicted invasive profile appears to be determined more by a lower model-predicted net proliferation rate rather than an increased model-predicted dispersal rate of the glioma cells. Receiver operator curve analysis of the model-predicted MRI-based invasion profile revealed an area under the curve of 0.91, indicative of a predictive relationship. The robustness of this relationship was tested by cross-validation analysis of the invasion profile as a predictive metric for IDH1 status. Conclusions: The strong correlation between IDH1 mutation status and the MRI-based invasion profile suggests that use of our tumor growth model may lead to noninvasive clinical detection of IDH1 mutation status and thus lead to better treatment planning, particularly prior to surgical resection, for contrast-enhancing gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24832620
"""Evaluation of Microvascular Density in Glioblastomas in Relation to p53 and Ki67 Immunoexpression.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor in the central nervous system, with a survival rate of less than 15 months despite multimodal therapy. Tumor recurrence frequently occurs after removal. Tumoral angiogenesis, the formation of neovessels, has a positive impact on tumor progression and invasion, although there are controversial results in the specialized literature regarding its impact on survival. This study aims to correlate the immunoexpression of angiogenesis markers (CD34, CD105) with the proliferation index Ki67 and p53 in primary and secondary glioblastomas. This retrospective study included 54 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma at the Pathology Department of County Emergency Clinical Hospital Târgu Mureș. Microvascular density was determined using CD34 and CD105 antibodies, and the results were correlated with the immunoexpression of p53, IDH1, ATRX and Ki67. The number of neoformed blood vessels varied among cases, characterized by different shapes and calibers, with endothelial cells showing modified morphology and moderate to marked pleomorphism. Neovessels with a glomeruloid aspect, associated with intense positivity for CD34 or CD105 in endothelial cells, were observed, characteristic of glioblastomas. Mean microvascular density values were higher for the CD34 marker in all cases, though there were no statistically significant differences compared to CD105. Mutant IDH1 and ATRX glioblastomas, wild-type p53 glioblastomas, and those with a Ki67 index above 20% showed a more abundant microvascular density, with statistical correlations not reaching significance.

"""Transforming growth factor-beta: a molecular target for the future therapy of glioblastoma.""","""The median survival of patients with glioblastoma treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is in the range of 12 months. These limits in the efficacy of current treatment modalities call for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the specific biological features of this type of cancer. Glioblastomas are a rich source of immunosuppressive molecules which may interfere with immune recognition and rejection as well as clinical strategies of active immunotherapy. The most prominent glioblastoma-associated immunosuppressant is the cytokine, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a multifunctional cytokine which not only interferes with multiple steps of afferent and efferent immune responses, but also stimulates migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The complex regulation of TGF-beta bioavailability includes its synthesis as a proprotein, proteolytic processing by furin-like proteases, assembly in a latent complex, and finally liberation from latency by multiple effector mechanisms, a process collectively referred to as activation. Several in vitro paradigms and rodent glioma models have been used to demonstrate that the antagonism of TGF-beta holds promise for the treatment of glioblastoma, employing antisense strategies, inhibition of pro-TGF-beta processing, scavenging TGF-beta by decorin, or blocking TGF-beta activity by specific TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaR) I kinase antagonists. Moreover, the local application of TGF-beta(2) antisense oligonucleotides is currently evaluated in a randomized clinical trial for recurrent malignant glioma. In summary, we propose that TGF-beta-antagonistic treatment strategies are among the most promising of the current innovative approaches for glioblastoma, particularly in conjunction with novel approaches of cellular immunotherapy and vaccination.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16454748

However, a small subgroup with good response to combined radiation and carbogen treatment was identified showing little hypoxia and mainly necrosis in the regrowing tumors. These microenvironmental characteristics were not seen in tumors of the other treatment groups.

We recently reported that PTEN (MMAC1) on 10q23.3 is mutated in approximately 30% of primary (de novo) glioblastomas but rarely in secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas. Because secondary glioblastomas also show LOH#10, tumor suppressor genes other than PTEN are likely to be involved. We analyzed LOH on chromosomes 10 and 19, using polymorphic microsatellite markers in microdissected foci showing histologically an abrupt transition from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma to glioblastoma, suggestive of the emergence of a new tumor clone. When compared to the respective low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma of the same biopsy, deletions were detected in 7 of 8 glioblastoma foci on 10q25-qter distal to D10S597, covering the DMBT1 and FGFR2 loci. Six of 8 foci showed LOH at one or two flanking markers of PTEN but did not contain PTEN mutations. LOH on 10p and 19q was found in only one case each.

Methods: From January 1, 2014 to January 3, 2015 we conducted 239 adult autopsies, 8 of which were identified on search to be GBMs. Results: Of these 8 GBMs, one-half showed bulky spread (SVS (n = 2), LM (n = 2), bone marrow (n = 1)), and 2 of these 4 additionally had microscopic LM. In patient 1 GBM with a very minor epithelioid component on the surgical specimen spread evolved to a predominantly epithelioid GBM (E-GBM) phenotype in the clinically-unsuspected LM at autopsy. Patient 2, with malignant glioma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MGPNET), had a secondary GBM with a noncanonical isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation and 11-year-survival; autopsy showed encasement of the entire bilateral ventricular system by SVS. Patient 3, also with an IDH1- positive secondary GBM, had survived 10 years, only to develop thrombocytopenia and succumb to extensive bone marrow replacement by his tumor. Patient 4 had a radiation-induced posterior fossa GBM that demonstrated LM/SVS spread pattern identical to that described in pediatric diffuse pontine gliomas. Conclusions: Several subtypes of adult GBM (MG-PNET, posterior fossa GBMs, E-GBMs) have recently been recognized to have a propensity for LM; autopsy permission should especially be sought for these tumor types. Correlation between genetics and LM/SVS is now possible and may shed further light on this behavior.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26308254
"""Exploration of the radiosensitivity-related prognostic risk signature in patients with glioma: evidence from microarray data.""","""Background: Gene expression signatures can be used as prognostic biomarkers in various types of cancers. We aim to develop a gene signature for predicting the response to radiotherapy in glioma patients. Methods: Radio-sensitive and radio-resistant glioma cell lines (M059J and M059K) were subjected to microarray analysis to screen for differentially expressed mRNAs. Additionally, we obtained 169 glioblastomas (GBM) samples and 5 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, as well as 80 GBM samples and 4 normal samples from the GSE7696 set. The 'DESeq2' R package was employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal brain samples and GBM samples. Combining the prognostic-related molecules identified from the TCGA, we developed a radiosensitivity-related prognostic risk signature (RRPRS) in the training set, which includes 152 patients with glioblastoma. Subsequently, we validated the reliability of the RRPRS in a validation set containing 616 patients with glioma from the TCGA database, as well as an internal validation set consisting of 31 glioblastoma patients from the Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University. Results: Based on the microarray and LASSO COX regression analysis, we developed a nine-gene radiosensitivity-related prognostic risk signature. Patients with glioma were divided into high- or low-risk groups based on the median risk score. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the progression-free survival (PFS) of the high-risk group was significantly shorter. The signature accurately predicted PFS as assessed by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses. Stratified analysis demonstrated that the signature is specific to predict the outcome of patients who were treated using radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the predictor was an independent predictor for the prognosis of patients with glioma. The prognostic nomograms accompanied by calibration curves displayed the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS and OS in patients with glioma. Conclusion: Our study established a new nine-gene radiosensitivity-related prognostic risk signature that can predict the prognosis of patients with glioma who received radiotherapy. The nomogram showed great potential to predict the prognosis of patients with glioma treated using radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37700319
"""Phosphorylated Hsp27 is mutually exclusive with ATRX loss and the IDH1(R132H) mutation and may predict better prognosis among glioblastomas without the IDH1 mutation and ATRX loss.""","""Aim: To identify biomarkers for accurate classification of glioma. Patients and methods: We evaluated the heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), phosphorylated Hsp27 (p-Hsp27), ATRX and IDH1R132Hproteins using immunohistochemistry in 421 glioma tissues. The χ2 test was used to assess the relationship between molecular alterations and clinico-pathological parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed, and differences were detected by the log-rank test. Results: We found that Hsp27 and p-Hsp27 were mainly expressed in aggressive astrocytic gliomas. However, neither Hsp27 nor p-Hsp27 expression was related to survival time for any grade of glioma. Interestingly, p-Hsp27 was mutually exclusive with ATRX loss (ATRX-) and the IDH1R132H mutation, except for one case of anaplastic astrocytoma. We classified glioblastomas (GBMs) into three subtypes: ATRX-/IDH1R132H, high p-Hsp27 expression (p-Hsp27+) and none of these three markers. ATRX-/IDH1R132Hshowed the longest median survival (19.6 months). The prognostic difference between p-Hsp27+ and none of these three markers was significant (15.0 vs 13.1 months, P=0.045). Moreover, p-Hsp27+ predicted better sensitivity for standard therapy among GBMs without the IDH1 mutation and ATRX loss (26.3 vs 15.5 months, P=0.008). Conclusion: p-Hsp27 is a novel biomarker of glioma and might have important clinical value for further classification of patients with wild-type IDH1 and normal ATRX expression, for evaluating prognosis and for guidance for adjuvant therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29550762

At present, temozolomide (TMZ) is recognized as the preferred chemotherapeutic drug for GBM, but some patients have low sensitivity to TMZ or chemotherapy resistance to TMZ. Our previous study found that GBM patients with EGFRvIII (+) have low sensitivity to TMZ. However, the reasons and possible mechanisms of the chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM patients with EGFRvIII (+) are not clear. (2) Methods: In this study, tissue samples of patients with GBM, GBM cell lines, glioma stem cell lines, and NSG mice were used to explore the causes and possible mechanisms of low sensitivity to TMZ in patients with EGFRvIII (+)-GBM. (3) Results: The study found that EGFRvIII promoted the proneural-mesenchymal transition of GBM and reduced its sensitivity to TMZ, and EGFRvIII regulated of the expression of ALDH1A3. (4) Conclusions: EGFRvIII activated the NF-κB pathway and further regulated the expression of ALDH1A3 to promote the proneural-mesenchymal transition of GBM and reduce its sensitivity to TMZ, which will provide an experimental basis for the selection of clinical drugs for GBM patients with EGFRvIII (+).""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36980923

Whether this occurs randomly during tumor development or characterizes a certain tumor cell subset is not known. Here we assayed primary glioblastomas for expression and subcellular localization of p53 and determined a correlation with expression of intermediate filament proteins characterizing glial cell development. Sixty-nine percent of the tumors were p53 positive in immunohistochemistry. A significant number of tumors (23%) accumulated wild-type p53 in the cytoplasm, which correlated with the presence of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein, except for 1 case. Tumors with exclusive nuclear p53 contained none or only one of these intermediate filament proteins. In an alternative approach, tumors positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein were screened for expression of p53 and vimentin. Thirty-eight percent of these tumors showed cytoplasmic p53, and all of those also expressed vimentin. Tumors with only nuclear p53 were vimentin negative, except for 1 case. No mutation was detected in p53 exons 5 to 8 in tumors with cytoplasmic p53, suggesting that they express wild-type p53.

"""Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the impact of chromosomal instability on glioblastoma cancer stem cells.""","""Background: Intra-tumor heterogeneity stems from genetic, epigenetic, functional, and environmental differences among tumor cells. A major source of genetic heterogeneity comes from DNA sequence differences and/or whole chromosome and focal copy number variations (CNVs). Whole chromosome CNVs are caused by chromosomal instability (CIN) that is defined by a persistently high rate of chromosome mis-segregation. Accordingly, CIN causes constantly changing karyotypes that result in extensive cell-to-cell genetic heterogeneity. How the genetic heterogeneity caused by CIN influences gene expression in individual cells remains unknown. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on a chromosomally unstable glioblastoma cancer stem cell (CSC) line and a control normal, diploid neural stem cell (NSC) line to investigate the impact of CNV due to CIN on gene expression. From the gene expression data, we computationally inferred large-scale CNVs in single cells. Also, we performed copy number adjusted differential gene expression analysis between NSCs and glioblastoma CSCs to identify copy number dependent and independent differentially expressed genes. Results: Here, we demonstrate that gene expression across large genomic regions scales proportionally to whole chromosome copy number in chromosomally unstable CSCs. Also, we show that the differential expression of most genes between normal NSCs and glioblastoma CSCs is largely accounted for by copy number alterations. However, we identify 269 genes whose differential expression in glioblastoma CSCs relative to normal NSCs is independent of copy number. Moreover, a gene signature derived from the subset of genes that are differential expressed independent of copy number in glioblastoma CSCs correlates with tumor grade and is prognostic for patient survival. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CIN is directly responsible for gene expression changes and contributes to both genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity among glioblastoma CSCs. These results also demonstrate that the expression of some genes is buffered against changes in copy number, thus preserving some consistency in gene expression levels from cell-to-cell despite the continuous change in karyotype driven by CIN. Importantly, a gene signature derived from the subset of genes whose expression is buffered against copy number alterations correlates with tumor grade and is prognostic for patient survival that could facilitate patient diagnosis and treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31151460

In addition, we performed a concordance analysis and diagnostic test accuracy review between IDH1 IHC and molecular tests. The estimated rates of IDH1 IHC were 0.106 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.085-0.132]. The IDH1 IHC positive rate of primary and secondary glioblastomas was 0.049 (95 % CI 0.023-0.99) and 0.729 (95 % CI 0.477-0.889), respectively. The overall concordance rate between IDH1 IHC and molecular test was 0.947 (95 % CI 0.878-0.978).

"""Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10q in glioblastomas, and its association with other genetic alterations and survival in Indian patients.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant central nervous system neoplasm. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10q in these tumors has been found to show variable association with prognosis. Aim: To evaluate LOH 10q status in cases of GBM, and to correlate these results with patient characteristics, other genetic alterations, and survival. Material and methods: Fresh tumor tissue and blood samples were obtained for 25 cases of GBM diagnosed over a 2-year period. LOH 10q assay was performed on blood and tumor DNA by a PCR-based method using four microsatellite markers. TP53 mutation analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were performed. Histopathology was reviewed and clinical data were analyzed. Results: LOH 10q was identified in 17 of 25 cases (68%). Losses were frequent with markers D10S1765 (12/20 informative cases; 60%) and D10S587 (12/17 informative cases; 70.5%) in the regions of 10q23.3 and 10q26.1, respectively. D10S540 for 10q25.1 showed LOH in 4/12 informative cases (33.3%) and D10S1770 for 10q26-ter in none of the 25 cases. LOH with D10S1765 at the PTEN gene locus was found to correlate with overall LOH 10q status (P = 0.001). LOH 10q was more common in patients older than 40 years (16/19, 84.2%) than in those below (1/6, 16.7%) (P = 0.006). One of three pediatric patients included demonstrated LOH 10q. Survival rates for patients with LOH were lower than for patients with retained heterozygosity. Conclusion: LOH 10q is a frequent genetic abnormality in GBM in Indian patients, is seen more frequently in older adults, and its presence is associated with shorter survival. The single best marker to determine LOH 10q status is D10S1765 at the PTEN region.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21483128
"""Molecular landscape of IDH-wild type, pTERT-wild type adult glioblastomas.""","""Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter (pTERT) mutation has often been described as a late event in gliomagenesis and it has been suggested as a prognostic biomarker in gliomas other than 1p19q codeleted tumors. However, the characteristics of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type (wt) (IDHwt), pTERTwt glioblastomas are not well known. We recruited 72 adult IDHwt, pTERTwt glioblastomas and performed methylation profiling, targeted sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for TERT structural rearrangement and ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between our cohort and a the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of IDHwt, pTERT mutant (mut) glioblastomas, suggesting that pTERT mutation on its own is not a prognostic factor among IDHwt glioblastomas. Epigenetically, the tumors clustered into classic-like (11%), mesenchymal-like (32%), and LGm6-glioblastoma (GBM) (57%), the latter far exceeding the corresponding proportion seen in the TCGA cohort of IDHwt, pTERTmut glioblastomas. LGm6-GBM-clustered tumors were enriched for platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) amplification or mutation (p = 0.008), and contained far fewer epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification (p < 0.01), 10p loss (p = 0.001) and 10q loss (p < 0.001) compared with cases not clustered to this group. LGm6-GBM cases predominantly showed ALT (p = 0.038). In the whole cohort, only 35% cases showed EGFR amplification and no case showed combined chromosome +7/-10. Since the cases were already pTERTwt, so the three molecular properties of EGFR amplification, +7/-10, and pTERT mutation may not cover all IDHwt glioblastomas. Instead, EGFR and PDGFRA amplifications covered 67% and together with their mutations covered 71% of cases of this cohort. Homozygous deletion of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)/B was associated with a worse OS (p = 0.031) and was an independent prognosticator in multivariate analysis (p = 0.032). In conclusion, adult IDHwt, pTERTwt glioblastomas show epigenetic clustering different from IDHwt, pTERTmut glioblastomas, and IDHwt glioblastomas which are pTERTwt may however not show EGFR amplification or +7/-10 in a significant proportion of cases.

We review the literature pertaining to the mechanism by which revascularisation occurs following tumour irradiation using experimental models. Areas of interest and debate in the literature include the process by which endothelial cells die after irradiation and the identity/origin of the cells that reconstitute the tumour blood vessels after injury.

"""p53 mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in glioblastoma.""","""Recent molecular studies indicate two different genetic pathways leading to the development of glioblastoma; final progression of astrocytoma and de novo formation. To define the mutual relationships of cytogenetic changes in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, molecular histopathologic alterations of p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were evaluated by single stranded conformational polymorphion, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical stains in 15 primary and 21 secondary glioblastomas. Mutations in p53 gene and positive immunoreactivity to p53 protein (DO1) were more prevalent in secondary glioblastomas than in primary glioblastomas. A correlation between p53 mutations and p53 immunopositivities in glioblastomas was observed in 83.3% of the cases. All cases with positive p53 immunoreactivities showed p53 mutations; however, 13.9% of glioblastomas with p53 immuno-positivities lacked the relevant mutations. EGFR amplifications were detected in 73.3% of primary glioblastomas and 9.5% of secondary glioblastomas (p<0.001). The concurrence of p53 mutation and EGFR amplification was revealed in only 2 out of 15 primary glioblastomas and none among the secondary glioblastomas. Immunoreactivities for EGFR were noted in 66.7% of primary glioblastomas and in 9.5% of secondary glioblastomas (p<0.001).

Methods: Study material was stained immunohistochemically for polySia, NCAM and IDH1-R132H point mutation. Confocal microscopy of polySia and NCAM staining was performed on tissue micro-array samples (TMA) of 242 diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas (grade II: 28; grade III: 33; grade IV: 181) and 82 pilocytic astrocytomas. The results were statistically correlated to clinicopathological factors and survival data. Results: PolySia was observed in 45 cases (19%) and NCAM positivity in 92 cases (38%). All 45 tumors with polySia positivity were also positive for NCAM whereas there were 47 tumors which contained positive staining for NCAM but not for polySia. The simultaneous expression was concomitant and colocalized suggesting polysialyated NCAM (polySia-NCAM). PolySia expression was significantly stronger in IDH1 mutated tumors than in IDH1 non-mutated (p = 0.001, chi-square test). There were no significant differences in polySia-NCAM between primary tumors or recurrences (p = n.s., chi-square test). PolySia positivity was associated with longer patient survival in relation to total tumor material (p = 0.020, log-rank test). Furthermore, when only glioblastomas were assessed, patients with positive polySia had significantly better prognosis (p = 0.006, log-rank test). In multivariate survival analysis, polySia was found to be an independent prognostic factor. PolySia was nearly absent in grade I pilocytic astrocytomas (1 immunopositive tumor of 82). Conclusions: Expression of polySia is common in adult grade II-IV astrocytomas, whereas it is nearly absent in pediatric grade I pilocytic astrocytomas. PolySia positivity is associated with longer survival rates in patients with a grade II-IV astrocytomas and also grade IV glioblastomas assessed separately.

"""EZH2 Mediates Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Promoted by Estradiol in Human Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive brain tumors. 17β-estradiol (E2) increases proliferation, migration, and invasion of human GBM cells; however underlying mechanisms are no fully understood. Zeste 2 Enhancer Homologous enzyme (EZH2) is a methyltransferase part of Polycomb 2 repressor complex (PRC2). In GBM, EZH2 is overexpressed and involved in the cell cycle, migration, and invasion processes. We studied the role of EZH2 in the pro-oncogenic actions of E2 in human GBM cells. EZH2 gene silencing and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 blocked proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells induced by E2. We identified in silico additional putative estrogen response elements (EREs) at the EZH2 promoter, but E2 did not modify EZH2 expression. In silico analysis also revealed that among human GBM samples, EZH2 expression was homogeneous; in contrast, the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) allowed the classification of the samples into groups. Even in the GBM cluster with high expression of ERs and those of their target genes, the expression of PCR2 target genes did not change. Overall, our data suggest that in GBM cells, pro-oncogenic actions of E2 are mediated by EZH2, without changes in EZH2 expression and by mechanisms that appear to be unrelated to the transcriptional activity of ERs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35197928

"""The natural history of extracranial metastasis from glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Extracranial metastasis is a unique but rare manifestation of glioblastoma multiforme. It is thought to arise from glioblastoma cells disseminated into the blood stream. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of 88 cases of extracranial glioblastoma (5 were gliosarcomas) published between 1928 and 2009. Cases included in the analysis were primary or secondary glioblastomas that subsequently invaded organs outside the brain or spinal cord. The median age was 38 years and the median overall survival time was 10.5 months (range 0.0-60.0 months). The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of primary glioblastoma was 2.5 months, from diagnosis to detection of extracranial metastasis was 8.5 months, and from metastasis to death was 1.5 months. From 1940 to 2009, there has been progressive lengthening of the interval from detection of extracranial metastasis to death, at a rate of 0.7 months per decade (95% confidence interval 0.5-1.0 month). Use of magnetic resonance imaging correlates with an increase in overall survival but not age, gender, or site of primary glioblastoma. Patients treated with surgery + radiation + chemotherapy + cerebrospinal fluid shunting had the longest average survival interval from metastasis to death when compared to those treated with surgery alone, radiation alone, surgery + radiation, and surgery + radiation + chemotherapy. Lung metastasis is a prognostic factor of extremely poor outcomes. We conclude that patients with glioblastoma extracranial metastasis have poor prognosis, but there has been a progressive lengthening of survival in each successive decade from 1940 to 2000.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21512826
"""Comparative epidemiology of gliosarcoma and glioblastoma and the impact of Race on overall survival: A systematic literature review.""","""Objective: Gliosarcoma (GSM) is a rare subtype of glioblastoma (GBM) that accounts for approximately four percent of high-grade gliomas. There is scarce epidemiological data on patients with GSM as a distinct subgroup of GBM. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed of peer-reviewed databases using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to evaluate the impact of race and ethnicity on survival in patients with GSM compared to patients with GBM. Results: Following initial abstract screening, a total of 138 articles pertaining to GSM and 275 pertaining to GBM met criteria for full-text review, with 5 and 27 articles included in the final analysis for GSM and GBM, respectively. The majority of patients in both cohorts were non-Hispanic Whites, representing 85.6 % of total GSM patients and 87.7 % of GBM patients analyzed. Two GSM studies stratified survival by race, with one reporting the longest median survival for the Hispanic population of 10.6 months and the shortest median survival for the Asian population of 9 months. Among the GBM studies analyzed, the majority of studies reported shorter survival and higher risk of mortality among White Non-Hispanics compared to non-White patients; and of the 15 studies which reported data for the Asian population, 12 studies reported this race category to have the longest survival compared to all other races studied. Younger age, female sex, MGMT promoter methylation status, and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy were associated with improved survival in both GSM and GBM cohorts, although these were not further stratified by race. Conclusion: GSM portends a similarly poor prognosis to other GBM subtypes; however, few studies exist which have examined factors associated with differences in survival between these histologic variants. This review of the literature suggests there is a possible association between race and survival for patients with GBM, however data supporting this conclusion for patients with GSM is lacking. These findings suggest that GSM is a distinct disease from other GBM subtypes, with epidemiologic differences that should be further explored.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32650210
"""Inhibition of telomerase increases the susceptibility of human malignant glioblastoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.""","""Malignant glioblastomas grow very rapidly and are generally resistant to either DNA-damaging drugs or gamma-irradiation. If tumor cells could be made more susceptible to cell death with treatments, this would clearly represent a significant improvement in the success of treatment. Recently, telomerase has become a focus of interest among oncologists as a target for treating cancer cells. Telomerase elongates telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGGG)n and is important in protecting and replicating DNA. The vast majority of tumor cells, indeed, express telomerase activity whereas normal somatic cells, except for a few cells, do not. Since telomerase is essential for protecting DNA, we may be able to make tumors more sensitive to treatments with DNA-damaging drugs by inhibiting telomerase activity. In this study, we used cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin)-sensitive U87-MG cells and cisplatin-resistant U251-MG of human malignant glioblastoma cell lines. U87-MG cells did not express telomerase activity, whereas telomerase was highly detected in U251-MG cells. Interestingly, inhibition of telomerase with an antisense telomerase expression vector not only decreased telomerase activity but also increased susceptibility to cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in U251-MG cells. These findings suggest that treatment with antisense telomerase may represent a new chemosensitisation for tumors resistant to anticancer drugs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619833
"""Glioblastoma multiforme: morphology and biology.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme, representing about 50% of all gliomas, encompasses a group of intrinsic tumours of the brain in later years (age peak around 50 years), the morphological hallmarks of which are an ensemble of variations in tumour cell and tissue structure featuring its biological malignancy. Glioblastoma, while sometimes appearing as a distinct 'primary' tumour type, is usually accepted as an extreme manifestation of anaplasia and dedifferentiation of glia, mostly astrocytic. The astrocytic nature of most glioblastomas has been confirmed by ultrastructural studies and progressive differentiation of tumours maintained in organotypic tissue culture. Reproducible experimental models are particularly induced by oncogenic RNA (oncorna) viruses. The cell kinetic parameters are similar to those of other solid malignant tumours except for a comparatively low growth fraction of glioblastoma. The frequent occurrence of giant cells as well as of regressive changes with necrosis and vascular responses are indirect (secondary) indicators of malignancy which coincide with histochemical (enzymatic anisochronia) and biochemical data (lower level of glia specific S100 protein than in differentiated gliomas). Vascular proliferation, a characteristic feature of glioblastoma, may occasionally progress to sarcomatous transformation with development of gliosarcomas (mixed glial-mesenchymal tumours). While dissemination of glioblastoma through the cerebrospinal pathways is not uncommon, extraneural distant metastatic spread is rare, and usually observed after craniotomy. The results of modern neuro-oncology support the pathogenetic view that glioblastoma results from neoplastic transformation of glial elements with continuing dedifferentiation. This transformation can be experimentally induced by various factors including oncogenic DNA (oncorna) viruses by using a reverse transcriptase, while there is indirect evidence for an oncorna-virus information in human glioblastoma. The significance of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of brain tumours and in the course of neoplastic transformation of glia is not yet understood, but both morphological and immunological data are in favour of a cell mediated immunological reaction against tumour-specific antibodies. Since immunological factors and changes in cytokinetics are apparently active after the transformed tumour cells proliferate, all available therapeutic methods, including radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy of glioblastoma only influence the final stages of neoplastic development with clinical manifestation of the tumour. In spite of modern combination and multimodality therapy schemes the prognosis of glioblastoma is still poor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/211808

"""Outcome prediction in patients with glioblastoma by using imaging, clinical, and genomic biomarkers: focus on the nonenhancing component of the tumor.""","""Purpose: To correlate patient survival with morphologic imaging features and hemodynamic parameters obtained from the nonenhancing region (NER) of glioblastoma (GBM), along with clinical and genomic markers. Materials and methods: An institutional review board waiver was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. Forty-five patients with GBM underwent baseline imaging with contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion MR imaging. Molecular and clinical predictors of survival were obtained. Single and multivariable models of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were explored with Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox regression, and random survival forests. Results: Worsening OS (log-rank test, P = .0103) and PFS (log-rank test, P = .0223) were associated with increasing relative cerebral blood volume of NER (rCBVNER), which was higher with deep white matter involvement (t test, P = .0482) and poor NER margin definition (t test, P = .0147). NER crossing the midline was the only morphologic feature of NER associated with poor survival (log-rank test, P = .0125). Preoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and resection extent (n = 30) were clinically significant OS predictors (log-rank test, P = .0176 and P = .0038, respectively). No genomic alterations were associated with survival, except patients with high rCBVNER and wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation had significantly poor survival (log-rank test, P = .0306; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.62). Combining resection extent with rCBVNER marginally improved prognostic ability (permutation, P = .084). Random forest models of presurgical predictors indicated rCBVNER as the top predictor; also important were KPS, age at diagnosis, and NER crossing the midline. A multivariable model containing rCBVNER, age at diagnosis, and KPS can be used to group patients with more than 1 year of difference in observed median survival (0.49-1.79 years). Conclusion: Patients with high rCBVNER and NER crossing the midline and those with high rCBVNER and wild-type EGFR mutation showed poor survival. In multivariable survival models, however, rCBVNER provided unique prognostic information that went above and beyond the assessment of all NER imaging features, as well as clinical and genomic features.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24646147

"""Analysis of Connexin 43 and Spermine Co-localisation in Glioblastomas.""","""Gap junctions are channels between adjacent cells, contributing to the unhindered exchange of metabolites, second messengers, nucleotides, and other molecules. The functional status of gap junctions in brain tumours is underinvestigated. One avenue of research focuses on exploring the expression of polyamines and their co-localisation with the Connexin 43 (Cx43) in the growth zones of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this work was to analyse the expression of Cx43 and spermine in human GBM to reveal their roles in neuro-oncogenesis. Human GBM sample sections were used for the immunochemistry [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Cx43, and spermine], confocal laser scanning microscopy, and electron immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that the more extensive processes of GBM cells exhibit GFAP. All GBM samples (n = 10) exhibited positive Cx43 signals in the form of variously sized dots and lines. Cx43 formed dotted lines around cell bodies with segmented transformed nuclei, which were also present in the gliovascular complexes. Furthermore, spermine was overexpressed in all tumour samples (cytoplasm and large and thin tumour processes), including the areas of Cx43 localisation. Merging the Cx43 and spermine signals showed co-expression in the same regions: the membranes of individual cells and individual points on processes in the tumour tissue. Therefore, we established the staining of the co-localisation of Cx43 and the polyamine spermine within glioblastoma, revealing that tumour processes housing the polyamine indeed form gap junctions, suggesting their potential joint interaction. This finding indicates that glioma cells can integrate into the surrounding neural networks, potentially serving as a mechanism to release glycolysis products, relying on gap junction activity facilitated by spermine. Cx43 exhibits sensitivity to polyamines, which play a role in opening gap junctional channels. Furthermore, polyamines have been observed to eliminate the blockades caused by hydrogen ions and calcium, which is crucial for cellular physiology.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39400836

Between 30 and 98 percent of the normal brain tissue was destroyed by invading glioma cells within 4 days. The degree of invasion did not correlate with patient survival. A slightly higher invasiveness and shorter survival was seen in tumors with EGF receptor overexpression, and the opposite pattern was found for tumors with a TP53 mutation. The degree of invasiveness in vitro was far higher than would be expected from the dynamics of clinically observed tumor spread. This suggests that mechanisms suppressing invasion may be operative in the normal brain; alternatively the differences may be due to a higher permissiveness of the fetal brain tissue for invasion in vitro.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11763417

Methods: RT-PCR and Northern blot were used to detect the expression of LRRC4 gene in 6 glioblastomas cells lines. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to screen the LRRC4 gene mutation, while bioinformation assay was used to search for the reason of LRRC4 gene absence in U251 cell lines. Results: The expression of LRRC4 was absent in 6 malignant glioma cell lines (U251, U87, BT325, SF126, SF767 and M17), which were examined by Northern-blot and RT-PCR assay. All sequencing of PCR products from gDNA of SF126, SF767, and M17 cell lines contained the point mutation at the same position ( LRRC4 geneT977A) (3/5), which was a synonymous mutation. However, PCR products from gDNA of U251 and U87 cell lines (2/5) were not obtained. The expression absence of LRRC4 was ascribed to the loss of homozygosity of 7q32-ter in U251 cell lines. Conclusion: The expression of LRRC4 gene is absent in glioblastoma cell lines, and it offers the important experiment proof for LRRC4 to act as a new candidate of brain tumor suppressor gene from glioma. The loss of homozygosity of 7q32-ter contributed to the expression absence of LRRC4 in U251 cell lines.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17478928

"""Cerebrospinal fluid methylome-based liquid biopsies for accurate malignant brain neoplasm classification.""","""Background: Resolving the differential diagnosis between brain metastases (BM), glioblastomas (GBM), and central nervous system lymphomas (CNSL) is an important dilemma for the clinical management of the main three intra-axial brain tumor types. Currently, treatment decisions require invasive diagnostic surgical biopsies that carry risks and morbidity. This study aimed to utilize methylomes from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a biofluid proximal to brain tumors, for reliable non-invasive classification that addresses limitations associated with low target abundance in existing approaches. Methods: Binomial GLMnet classifiers of tumor type were built, in fifty iterations of 80% discovery sets, using CSF methylomes obtained from 57 BM, GBM, CNSL, and non-neoplastic control patients. Publicly-available tissue methylation profiles (N = 197) on these entities and normal brain parenchyma were used for validation and model optimization. Results: Models reliably distinguished between BM (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.0), GBM (AUROC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.63-1.0), and CNSL (AUROC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.66-1.0) in independent 20% validation sets. For validation, CSF-based methylome signatures reliably distinguished between tumor types within external tissue samples and tumors from non-neoplastic controls in CSF and tissue. CSF methylome signals were observed to align closely with tissue signatures for each entity. An additional set of optimized CSF-based models, built using tumor-specific features present in tissue data, showed enhanced classification accuracy. Conclusions: CSF methylomes are reliable for liquid biopsy-based classification of the major three malignant brain tumor types. We discuss how liquid biopsies may impact brain cancer management in the future by avoiding surgical risks, classifying unbiopsiable tumors, and guiding surgical planning when resection is indicated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455236
"""Surgical resection and radiation therapy versus biopsy and radiation therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""There has been considerable controversy over the concept of treating glioblastoma multiforme with cytoreductive surgery. Therefore, a retrospective study of cases treated between 1986 and 1991 was conducted to analyze and compare the results of stereotactic biopsy followed by radiation therapy performed in 58 patients with those of surgical resection plus radiation therapy in 57 patients. In both groups, conventionally fractionated radiation (1.7 to 2.0 Gy/day) was delivered, with a total dose of 50 to 60 Gy. Biopsy was performed only in patients with tumors judged to be inoperable. These patients carried a higher surgical risk and were in worse neurological condition than the patients in the resection group. The median survival time for the resection group was 39.5 weeks, as compared with 32 weeks for the biopsy group. This difference was not significant. The most important prognostic factor was the patient's age. The treatment variable biopsy versus resection did not reach prognostic relevance. In patients with midline shift who underwent biopsy, the Karnofsky Performance Scale score decreased in more patients during radiation therapy. The clinical status 6 weeks after surgery, however, showed no significant differences between the two groups. The comparable survival times for the two groups place doubt on the concept of treating glioblastoma multiforme with cytoreductive surgery. Presently, radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for patients with glioblastoma. There is no question that decompressive surgery followed by radiation therapy should be performed whenever necessary for sever space-occupying lesions and when it will not cause new neurological deficits.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8385709

In order to accomplish this, preoperative magnetic resonance images from 163 patients with primary glioblastomas were retrospectively analyzed. All tumors were manually marked and registered to the standard space. Using the voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach, voxels exhibiting the strongest correlations with p53 mutants were identified. T-values of voxels that were greater than 95% of the permutations were factored into the results of the mapping analysis. Distinct anatomical characteristics between p53-mutated and wild-type glioblastomas were demonstrated using this approach. More specifically, we found that p53-mutated glioblastomas were preferentially located in the frontal lobe in the area surrounding the rostral extension of the lateral ventricles. The distinct anatomical characteristics of p53-mutated and wild-type glioblastomas provide further evidence that these gliomas arise from distinct niche locations.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25130928
"""Apoptosis-based treatment of glioblastomas with ABT-737, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins.""","""Defects in the apoptotic signaling cascades contribute to the poor therapeutic response of malignant gliomas. As glioblastomas are characterized by high expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, we studied the effects of the novel Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-737, on malignant glioma cells. ABT-737 treatment released the pro-apoptotic Bax protein from its binding partner Bcl-2 and potently induced apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The local administration of ABT-737 prolonged the survival in an intracranial glioma xenograft model. Downregulation of Mcl-1 and overexpression of Bcl-2 sensitized the cells to ABT-737-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, ABT-737 potentiated the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and etoposide, and of the death ligand TRAIL. As glioma stem cells may play a crucial role for the tumor progression and the resistance to treatment in glioblastomas, we investigated the effects of ABT-737 on the subpopulation of glioma cells exhibiting stem cell characteristics. Inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by ABT-737 were less efficient in glioma stem cells than in non-stem cell-like glioma cells. As the resistance of glioma stem cells was associated with high Mcl-1 expression levels, ABT-737 treatment combined with downregulation of Mcl-1 could represent a promising novel approach in glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18663354
"""Integration of MicroRNA, mRNA, and Protein Expression Data for the Identification of Cancer-Related MicroRNAs.""","""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for the regulation of target genes involved in various biological processes, and may play oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have investigated the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes, using mRNA and miRNA expression data. However, mRNA expression levels do not necessarily represent the exact gene expression profiles, since protein translation may be regulated in several different ways. Despite this, large-scale protein expression data have been integrated rarely when predicting gene-miRNA relationships. This study explores two approaches for the investigation of gene-miRNA relationships by integrating mRNA expression and protein expression data. First, miRNAs were ranked according to their effects on cancer development. We calculated influence scores for each miRNA, based on the number of significant mRNA-miRNA and protein-miRNA correlations. Furthermore, we constructed modules containing mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs, in which these three molecular types are highly correlated. The regulatory interactions between miRNA and genes in these modules have been validated based on the direct regulations, indirect regulations, and co-regulations through transcription factors. We applied our approaches to glioblastomas (GBMs), ranked miRNAs depending on their effects on GBM, and obtained 52 GBM-related modules. Compared with the miRNA rankings and modules constructed using only mRNA expression data, the rankings and modules constructed using mRNA and protein expression data were shown to have better performance. Additionally, we experimentally verified that miR-504, highly ranked and included in the identified modules, plays a suppressive role in GBM development. We demonstrated that the integration of both expression profiles allows a more precise analysis of gene-miRNA interactions and the identification of a higher number of cancer-related miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056026

The aim of the study was to evaluate usefulness of multiparametric T2*DSC perfusion and diffusion MR imaging in the preoperative differentiation of these tumors. Material and methods: Seventy four solitary enhancing tumors (27 GBMs, 30 metastases, 17 PCNSLs) were enrolled in the study. Parameters of cerebral blood volume (rCBV), peak height (rPH), percentage of signal recovery (rPSR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were assessed from the tumor core and the peritumoral non-enhancing T2-hyperintense zone. Results: Within the tumor core there were no differences in perfusion and diffusion parameters between GBMs and metastases. Compared to GBMs and metastases, PCNSLs showed significantly lower rCBV and rPH, ADC as well as higher rPSR values. Max rCBV with a cut-off value of 2.18 demonstrated the highest accuracy of 0.98 in differentiating PCNSLs from other tumors. To distinguish GBMs from metastases analysis of the peritumoral zone was performed showing significantly higher rCBV, rPH and lower ADC values in GBMs with the highest accuracy of 0.94 found for max rCBV at a cut-off value of 0.98. Conclusions: Max rCBV seems to be the most important parameter to differentiate GBMs, metastases and PCNSLs. Analysis of max rCBV within the tumor core enables to distinguish hypoperfused PCNSLs from hyperperfused GBMs and metastases while evaluation of max rCBV within the peritumoral zone is helpful to distinguish GBMs showing peritumoral infiltration from metastases surrounded by pure edema.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29342201
"""Glioblastoma-synthesized G-CSF and GM-CSF contribute to growth and immunosuppression: Potential therapeutic benefit from dapsone, fenofibrate, and ribavirin.""","""Increased ratio of circulating neutrophils to lymphocytes is a common finding in glioblastoma and other cancers. Data reviewed establish that any damage to brain tissue tends to cause an increase in G-CSF and/or GM-CSF (G(M)-CSF) synthesized by the brain. Glioblastoma cells themselves also synthesize G(M)-CSF. G(M)-CSF synthesized by brain due to damage by a growing tumor and by the tumor itself stimulates bone marrow to shift hematopoiesis toward granulocytic lineages away from lymphocytic lineages. This shift is immunosuppressive and generates the relative lymphopenia characteristic of glioblastoma. Any trauma to brain-be it blunt, sharp, ischemic, infectious, cytotoxic, tumor encroachment, or radiation-increases brain synthesis of G(M)-CSF. G(M)-CSF are growth and motility enhancing factors for glioblastomas. High levels of G(M)-CSF contribute to the characteristic neutrophilia and lymphopenia of glioblastoma. Hematopoietic bone marrow becomes entrained with, directed by, and contributes to glioblastoma pathology. The antibiotic dapsone, the lipid-lowering agent fenofibrate, and the antiviral drug ribavirin are Food and Drug Administration- and European Medicines Agency-approved medicines that have potential to lower synthesis or effects of G(M)-CSF and thus deprive a glioblastoma of some of the growth promoting contributions of bone marrow and G(M)-CSF.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28459367

Membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) are a group of G protein-coupled receptors with a wide distribution and multiple functions in the organism. There are five mPRs subtypes described in humans: mPRα, mPRβ, mPRγ, mPRδ, and mPRε. It has been reported that human-derived GBM cells express the mPRα, mPRβ, and mPRγ subtypes, and that progesterone promotes GBM progression in part by mPRα specific activation; however, it is still unknown if mPRδ and mPRε are also expressed in this type of tumor cells. In this study, we characterized the expression and hormonal regulation of mPRδ and mPRε in human GBM cells. We also analyzed a set of biopsies from TCGA. We found that the expression of these receptors is dependent on the tumor's grade and that mPRδ expression is directly correlated to patients' survival while the opposite is observed for mPRε. By RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence, the expression of mPRδ and mPRε was detected for the first time in human GBM cells. An in silico analysis showed possible progesterone response elements in the promoter regions of mPRδ and mPRε, and progesterone treatments downregulated the expression of these receptors.

The effect of antisense-EGFR on cell differentiation was studied using morphological evaluation and western blotting analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The effect of antisense-EGFR on cell cycle was studied by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis of p53, Rb, p16 and CDK4 expressions. The effect of antisense-EGFR on telomerase activity was studied by telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Results: U87MG cells that were transfected with antisense-EGFR constructs had smaller cell bodies and longer processes, and expressed higher level of GFAP compared with that of the control cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the proportion of cells in G(0)/G(1) phases of the cell cycle in the antisense EGFR cDNA transfected clones increased significantly when compared with control cells, whereas the proportion of cells in S phase decreased markedly. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of wild-type p53 was significantly increased in the antisense-EGFR cDNA transfected clones, whereas the expressions of Rb, p16 and CDK4 were not altered.

Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. These subtype-specific patterns provide new insights into molecular and cellular composition of the infiltrative margins of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25114226
"""Traumatic glioblastoma: commentary and suggested mechanism.""","""The role of head trauma in the development of glioblastoma is highly controversial and has been minimized since first put forward. This is not unexpected because skull injuries are overwhelmingly more common than glioblastoma. This paper presents a commentary based on the contributions of James Ewing, who established a major set of criteria for the recognition of an official relationship between trauma and cancer. Ewing's criteria were very stringent. The scholars who succeeded Ewing have facilitated the characterization of traumatic brain injuries since the introduction of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Discussions of the various criteria that have since developed are now being conducted, and those of an unnecessarily limiting nature are being highlighted. Three transcription factors associated with traumatic brain injury have been identified: p53, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and c-MYC. A role for these three transcription factors in the relationship between traumatic brain injury and glioblastoma is suggested; this role may support a cause-and-effect link with the subsequent development of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29708004

We have established a new model that enables comprehensive neuropathological and neurophysiological analysis on identical tissue preparations. Rat C6 glioma cells stably transfected with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene are transplanted into rat neocortex, giving rise to diffusely invading gliomas histologically resembling human glioblastomas. After 2 weeks, 500- micro m-thick cerebral slices are prepared, stained with the voltage-sensitive dye RH795, and fluorescence changes associated with origin and spread of abnormal bioelectric activity upon washout of Mg(2+) are detected by a 464-element photodiode array at a rate of 785 frames/s. GFP fluorescence promotes identification of tumor cells during electrophysiological experiments and in neuropathological analyses using frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. By performing subsequent histological analysis of the slices examined neurophysiologically, origin and spread of abnormal activity can be correlated with structural and molecular (immunohistochemical) features. Specifically, we found that ictaform activity was initiated in cortical areas diffusely invaded by single tumor cells. This model is useful for further elucidating the electrophysiological, molecular and structural basis of glioma-associated epileptogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13680280

The polymerase chain reaction products using five microsatellite markers were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels and the ethidium bromide stained bands were photographed. Loss of heterozygosity was observed in 14 (74%) of 19 samples, with similar incidences in astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (67%, 80%, and 82%, respectively). The locus D22S300 (q12.1-q13.1) was most frequently involved, with loss of heterozygosity in eight (80%) of 10 informative glioblastomas at this locus. Increased loss of heterozygosity during tumor progression or recurrence was seen in two patients at the D22S300 (q12.1-q13.1) and TOP1P2 (q11.2-q13.1) loci. No correlation between loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22 and the postoperative survival was found. These findings suggest that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22q probably occurs quite frequently in astrocytic tumors. The chromosome segment 22q12.1-q13.1, around the D22S300 locus, may be the common region of deletion in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9301196
"""Management of glioblastoma multiforme in HIV patients: a case series and review of published studies.""","""Aims: HIV infection is associated with an increased incidence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Here we report four new cases of HIV-associated GBM, discuss these in the context of previously reported cases, and consider aspects of current glioma management in HIV-positive patients. Methods and results: Twenty-one cases of GBM in HIV-positive patients, including four treated recently at our own institution, are discussed. The median age at presentation of the whole series was 38 years (range 19-60 years). The median CD4 count at GBM presentation was 400 cells/mm(3) (range 80-610 cells/mm(3)). Patients had been HIV positive for a median of 3 years (range 0-11 years) before tumour presentation. Treatment and survival were analysed in 16 of the 21 patients (five published cases were excluded: three due to lack of further information and two spinal cord tumours). Treatment included surgical debulking, radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy, all of which were well tolerated. The median survival was 8 months for the 16 patients with assessable data. Conclusions: GBM occurs at an increased frequency and younger age in the HIV population than in the general population. HIV itself is not found in glioma specimens, but the effect of HIV infection on reduced immune surveillance is thought to promote the development of these tumours. The approach to management of HIV-positive patients with GBM should be the same as the general population, using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Vincristine should be used with caution due to potential interactions with highly active antiretroviral therapy, causing an increased rate of autonomic neuropathy. Continuous low-dose temozolomide treatment should also be used cautiously because of potential additive lymphopenia. Survival of glioma patients with HIV is dictated by their tumour, not their HIV status.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19589665
"""Combinatorial Drug Testing in 3D Microtumors Derived from GBM Patient-Derived Xenografts Reveals Cytotoxic Synergy in Pharmacokinomics-informed Pathway Interactions.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common form of primary malignant brain cancer in adults, is a devastating disease for which effective treatment has remained elusive for over 75 years. One reason for the minimal progress during this time is the lack of accurate preclinical models to represent the patient's tumor's in vivo environment, causing a disconnect in drug therapy effectiveness between the laboratory and clinic. While patient-derived xenografts (PDX's or xenolines) are excellent human tumor representations, they are not amenable to high throughput testing. Therefore, we developed a miniaturized xenoline system (microtumors) for drug testing. Nineteen GBM xenolines were profiled for global kinase (kinomic) activity revealing actionable kinase targets associated with intracranial tumor growth rate. Kinase inhibitors for these targets (WP1066, selumetinib, crizotinib, and cediranib) were selected for single and combination therapy using a fully human-derived three-dimensional (3D) microtumor model of GBM xenoline cells embedded in HuBiogel for subsequent molecular and phenotype assays. GBM microtumors closely resembled orthotopically-implanted tumors based on immunohistochemical analysis and displayed kinomic and morphological diversity. Drug response testing could be reproducibly performed in a 96-well format identifying several synergistic combinations. Our findings indicate that 3D microtumors can provide a suitable high-throughput model for combination drug testing.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29849102

GBM is often associated with epilepsy, which can be debilitating. Seizures and the development of epilepsy are the primary symptoms that have a severe impact on the quality of life for GBM patients. It is increasingly apparent that the nervous system plays an essential role in the tumor microenvironment for all cancer types, including GBM. In recent years, there has been a growing understanding of how neurotransmitters control the progression of gliomas. Evidence suggests that neurotransmitters and neuromodulators found in the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in the excitability, proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation of neurons, glial cells, and neural stem cells. The involvement of neurotransmitters appears to play a significant role in various stages of GBM. In this review, the focus is on presenting updated knowledge and emerging ideas regarding the interplay between neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, such as glutamate, GABA, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, adenosine, and their relationship with GBM and the seizures induced by this condition.

"""Recycling drug screen repurposes hydroxyurea as a sensitizer of glioblastomas to temozolomide targeting de novo DNA synthesis, irrespective of molecular subtype.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor. Standard-of-care treatment involves maximal surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide [TMZ]). The 5-year survival rate of patients with GBM is <10%, a colossal failure that has been partially attributed to intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to TMZ through O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in the tumor. Methods: A drug screening aimed at evaluating the potential recycling and repurposing of known drugs was conducted in TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines and primary cultures of newly diagnosed GBM with different MGMT promoter methylation status, phenotypic/genotypic background and subtype, and validated with sphere formation, cell migration assays, and quantitative invasive orthotopic in vivo models. Results: We identified hydroxyurea (HU) to synergize with TMZ in GBM cells in culture and in vivo, irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status, subtype, and/or stemness. HU acts specifically on the S-phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting the M2 unit of enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Knockdown of this enzyme using RNA interference and other known chemical inhibitors exerted a similar effect to HU in combination with TMZ both in culture and in vivo. Conclusions: We demonstrate preclinical efficacy of repurposing hydroxyurea in combination with TMZ for adjuvant GBM therapy. This combination benefit is of direct clinical interest given the extensive use of TMZ and the associated problems with TMZ-related resistance and treatment failure.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099956

"""Overexpression of TIMP-1 and Sensitivity to Topoisomerase Inhibitors in Glioblastoma Cell Lines.""","""The multifunctional protein - tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) - has been associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancers including glioblastomas. In addition, TIMP-1 has been associated with decreased response to chemotherapy, and especially the efficacy of the family of topoisomerase (TOP) inhibitors has been related to TIMP-1. As a second line treatment of glioblastomas, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab is administered in combination with the TOP1 inhibitor irinotecan and glioblastoma cell levels of TIMP-1 could therefore potentially influence the efficacy of such treatment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether a high TIMP-1 expression in glioblastoma cell lines would affect the sensitivity to TOP inhibitors, and whether TIMP-1 overexpressing cells would have alterered growth and invasion. We established TIMP-1 overexpressing subclones from two human glioblastoma cell lines. TIMP-1 overexpressing U87MG cells were significantly more resistant than low TIMP-1 expressing clones and parental cells when exposed to SN-38 (TOP1 inhibitor) or epirubicin (TOP2 inhibitor). No significant differences were observed for the TIMP-1 transfected A172 cells. Implantation of both U87MG and A172 spheroids into organotypic brain slice cultures revealed a reduced growth of TIMP-1 overexpressing U87MG spheroids, however, no significant differences in invasion were observed. The present study suggests that TIMP-1 overexpression reduces the effect of TOP inhibitors in glioblastoma. TIMP-1 also appeared to reduce spheroid growth, but did not influence invasion. Whether TIMP-1 plays a role in irinotecan resistance and has a predictive potential in glioblastoma patients remains to be elucidated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28963609

MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression and several biological processes and diseases, including cancer. Nevertheless, their roles in invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis of glioblastoma are not completely understood.

Clinical information and preoperative magnetic resonance images of 203 patients with GBMs were reviewed. TERT promoter mutation status was assessed by Sanger sequencing in all cases. Tumor lesions were manually segmented and then registered to a standard brain atlas. Then the specific brain regions associated with TERT promoter mutation status were subsequently identified by voxel-based regression analysis. TERT promoter mutations were detected in 94 (46.3 %) of the 203 patients. Voxel-based statistical analysis demonstrated that GBMs with TERT promoter mutations were much more likely to locate in the right temporal lobe, while those with wild-type TERT promoters were more likely to occur in the anterior region of the right lateral ventricle. No significant difference was found in the lesion volumes of the T2-identified tumor or in the contrast enhancement areas between the two groups.

It has proven difficult to identify new therapies that extend survival in patients with recurrent GBM, so one of the primary aims of new therapies is to reduce morbidity, restore or preserve neurologic functions, and the capacity to perform daily activities. Apart from temozolomide, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents do not appear to significantly impact response or survival, but produce toxicity that is likely to negatively impact QoL. New biological agents, such as bevacizumab, can induce a clinically meaningful proportion of durable responses among patients with recurrent GBM with an acceptable safety profile. Emerging evidence suggests that bevacizumab produces an improvement or preservation of neurocognitive function in GBM patients, suggestive of QoL improvement, in most poor-prognosis patients who would otherwise be expected to show a sudden and rapid deterioration in QoL.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21468776

Using a Pluc reporter regulated by an endothelial specific promoter and in vivo BLI to image hAMSC differentiation we gained insight on the therapeutic mechanism. Implanted hAMSCs homed to tumor vessels, where they differentiated to endothelial cells.

IDH mutations are the genetic hallmark of secondary glioblastomas. Gliosarcomas and giant cell glioblastomas are rare histological glioblastoma variants, which usually develop rapidly. We determined the genetic patterns of 36 gliosarcomas and 19 giant cell glioblastomas. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were absent in all 36 gliosarcomas and in 18 of 19 giant cell glioblastomas analyzed, indicating that they are histological variants of primary glioblastoma. Furthermore, LOH 10q (88%) and TERT promoter mutations (83%) were frequent in gliosarcomas. Copy number profiling using the 450k methylome array in 5 gliosarcomas revealed CDKN2A homozygous deletion (3 cases), trisomy chromosome 7 (2 cases), and monosomy chromosome 10 (2 cases). Giant cell glioblastomas had LOH 10q in 50% and LOH 19q in 42% of cases. ATRX loss was detected immunohistochemically in 19% of giant cell glioblastomas, but absent in 17 gliosarcomas.

CD133 (prominin-1) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein on the surface of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that has been associated with poor prognosis, therapy resistance, and tumor recurrence in GBM. Due to its connection to CSCs, to which tumor resistance and recurrence have been partially attributed in GBM, there is a growing field of research revolving around the potential role of CD133 in each of these processes. However, despite encouraging results in vitro and in vivo, the biological interplay of CD133 with these components is still unclear, causing a lack of clinical application. In parallel, omic data from biospecimens that include CD133 are beginning to emerge, increasing the importance of understanding CD133 for the effective use of these highly dimensional data sets.

While gliosarcoma may represent a distinct clinical entity given its unique histologic composition and molecular features, its relative prognostic significance remains uncertain. While treatment of gliosarcoma generally encompasses the same standardized approach used in glioblastoma, supporting evidence is limited given its rarity. Here, we characterized 32 cases of gliosarcoma and retrospectively evaluated survival relative to 451 glioblastoma patients diagnosed during the same era within the same institution. Overall, we identified 22 primary gliosarcomas, representing 4.7% of WHO Grade IV primary glioblastomas, and 10 secondary gliosarcomas.

Tumors with available molecular profiling were primarily MGMT-unmethylated (87.5%), IDH-1-preserved (100%) and EGFR wild-type (100%). Interestingly, while no significant median survival difference between primary gliosarcoma and glioblastoma was observed across the entire cohort (11.0 vs. 14.8 months, p = 0.269), median survival was worse for gliosarcoma specifically among patients who received modern temozolomide-based (TMZ) chemoradiotherapy (11.0 vs. 17.3 months, p = 0.006). Matched-pair analysis also trended toward worse median survival among gliosarcomas (11.0 vs. 19.6 months, log-rank p = 0.177, Breslow p = 0.010). While adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.206, p = 0.035) and TMZ-based chemotherapy (HR 0.531, p = 0.000) appeared protective, gliosarcoma emerged as a significantly poor prognostic factor on multivariate analysis (HR 3.27, p = 0.012).

"""Changes in the immunologic phenotype of human malignant glioma cells after passaging in vitro.""","""Although immunotherapeutic strategies against glioblastomas have been promising both in vitro and in animal models, similar successes have not been realized in human clinical trials. One reason may be that immunotherapeutic strategies are based on prior studies that primarily have used human glioblastoma cell lines passaged in vitro, which may not accurately reflect the in vivo properties of glioblastoma cells. In this report, we used flow cytometry to quantify the expression of immunological cell surface molecules on human glioblastomas directly ex vivo (prior to any in vitro culturing) and after varying passages in vitro. Furthermore, we used ELISA to quantitate cytokine secretion after various passages in vitro. We demonstrate that in vitro culturing of established cell lines led to increases in the cell surface expression of MHC class I and ICAM-1 and secretion of IL-6 and TGF-beta(2). Furthermore, there were significant changes in the expression of MHC class I, MHC class II, B7-2, ICAM-1, and FasL when comparing ex vivo tumor cells to those after a single passage in vitro. After passaging once in vitro, there were also significant changes in the secretion of TGF-beta(2) and IL-10. This report indicates that in vitro culturing leads to significant changes in both cell surface molecules and secreted cytokines, which are known to affect the ability of immune cells to initiate an anti-tumor immune response. These changes in the immunological phenotype of glioblastomas after in vitro culturing may in part explain the limited success of immunotherapeutic strategies against glioblastomas in human clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11781071
"""Hypoxia, Inflammation and Necrosis as Determinants of Glioblastoma Cancer Stem Cells Progression.""","""Tumor hypoxic microenvironment causes hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) activation and necrosis with alarmins release. Importantly, HIF-1α also controls the expression of alarmin receptors in tumor cells that can bind to and be activated by alarmins. Human tumor tissues possess 1-2% of cancer stem cells (CSCs) residing in hypoxic niches and responsible for the metastatic potential of tumors. Our hypothesis is that hypoxic CSCs express alarmin receptors that can bind alarmins released during necrosis, an event favoring CSCs migration. To investigate this aspect, glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) lines were kept under hypoxia to determine the expression of hypoxic markers as well as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). The presence of necrotic extracts increased migration, invasion and cellular adhesion. Importantly, HIF-1α inhibition by digoxin or acriflavine prevented the response of GSCs to hypoxia alone or plus necrotic extracts. In vivo, GSCs injected in one brain hemisphere of NOD/SCID mice were induced to migrate to the other one in which a necrotic extract was previously injected. In conclusion, our results show that hypoxia is important not only for GSCs maintenance but also for guiding their response to external necrosis. Inhibition of hypoxic pathway may therefore represent a target for preventing brain invasion by glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs).""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290386
"""The Impact of Extensive Surgical Resection of Butterfly Glioblastomas on Outcomes in the Presence of TERT Mutation and EGFR Amplification: A Retrospective Cohort Study.""","""Background and objectives: This study aimed to assess if extensive surgical resection enhances outcomes in wild-type Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) butterfly glioblastoma (B-GBM) patients, despite the presence of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) mutation and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) amplification. Methods: The study, retrospectively conducted from 2014 to 2022, involved 723 GBM patients, 41 of whom met the criteria for IDH wild-type B-GBM. Exclusion criteria comprised prior diagnoses or treatments for low-grade glial tumors. Surgeons, employing two approaches-partial and extensive surgery-categorized patients based on age, sex, tumor location, corpus callosum involvement, and genetic characteristics. The interval between initial surgery and tumor recurrence/tumor-free period (TR/TFP) and overall survival (OS) were recorded and compared between the partial and extensive resection groups, analyzing the impact of resection width on TR/TFP and OS. Preoperative assessments utilized thin-section cranial computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraoperatively, tumor excision was guided by sodium fluorescein, and margins were delineated via neuronavigation. Genetic alterations (TERT mutations and EGFR amplifications) were correlated with surgical type, TR/TFP, and OS. Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) evaluations were performed pre- and post-operatively and at key intervals, comparing outcomes between surgical groups. Standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens were administered to all patients. Results: Extensive resection yielded significantly longer TR/TFP compared to partial resection, despite TERT gene mutation and EGFR amplification being linked to shorter TR/TFP and OS. Its impact on OS, however, was not significant. KPS scores indicated a superior quality of life after extensive resection, with sustained improvement upon recurrence. Conclusions: Extensive resection of B-GBM, even in the presence of adverse genetic alterations, may prolong TR/TFP, offering patients a period of improved comfort with minimal distress.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39327682

In anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas the percentage of proliferating microglia showed a slight increase to 8.8% (+/- 3.6) and 13.4% (+/- 8.7), respectively. We conclude that microglial cells in astrocytic brain tumors proliferate and show different proliferative activities at different grades of malignancy with the highest rates of proliferating microglia especially in pilocytic astrocytomas.

Here, we have analysed chromosomal changes in comparison to tumour cell aggressiveness and chemosensitivity of three cell lines established from a primary tumour and consecutive recurrences (BTL1 to BTL3) of a long-term surviving glioblastoma patient together with paraffin-embedded materials of five further cases with recurrent disease. Following surgery, the BTL patient progressed under irradiation/ lomustine but responded to temozolomide after re-operation to temozolomide. The primary tumour -derived BTL1 cells showed chromosomal imbalances typical of highly aggressive glioblastomas. Interestingly, BTL2 cells established from the first recurrence developed under therapy showed signs of enhanced chromosomal instability. In contrast, BTL3 cells from the second recurrence resembled a less aggressive subclone of the primary tumour. Although BTL2 cells exhibited a highly aggressive phenotype, BTL3 cells were characterised by reduced proliferative and migratory potential. Despite persistent methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter, BTL3 cells exhibited the highest temozolomide sensitivity. A comparable situation was found in two out of five glioblastoma patients, both characterised by enhanced survival time, who also relapsed after surgery/chemotherapy with less aggressive recurrences. Taken together, our data suggest that pretreated glioblastoma patients may relapse with highly chemosensitive tumours confirming the feasibility of temozolomide treatment even in case of repeated recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342095

"""Pyk2/FAK Signaling Is Upregulated in Recurrent Glioblastoma Tumors in a C57BL/6/GL261 Glioma Implantation Model.""","""The majority of glioblastomas (GBMs) recur shortly after tumor resection and recurrent tumors differ significantly from newly diagnosed GBMs, phenotypically and genetically. In this study, using a Gl261-C57Bl/6 mouse glioma implantation model, we identified significant upregulation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation levels-pPyk2 (579/580) and pFAK (925)-without significant modifications in total Pyk2 and FAK protein expression in tumors regrown after surgical resection, compared with primary implanted tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that Pyk2 and FAK are involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and proliferation and are associated with reduced overall survival. We hypothesized that the use of inhibitors of Pyk2/FAK in the postsurgical period may reduce the growth of recurrent tumors. Using Western blot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence approaches, we demonstrated upregulation of Cyclin D1 and the Ki67 proliferation index in tumors regrown after resection, compared with primary implanted tumors. Treatment with Pyk2/FAK inhibitor PF-562271, administered through oral gavage at 50 mg/kg daily for two weeks beginning 2 days before tumor resection, reversed Pyk2/FAK signaling upregulation in recurrent tumors, reduced tumor volume, and increased animal survival.

Efforts are also ongoing to personalize the treatment of patients. Strategies to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of current treatments or indeed to identify potential novel additional options would be extremely beneficial to both clinicians and patients. In the past few years, system medicine approaches have been developed that model the biochemical pathways of apoptosis. These systems tools incorporate and analyse the complex biological networks involved. For their successful integration into clinical practice, it is mandatory to integrate systems approaches with routine clinical and histopathological practice to deliver personalized care for patients.

"""Dynamics of FLAIR Volume Changes in Glioblastoma and Prediction of Survival.""","""Background: The extent of tumor resection (EOTR) calculated by enhanced T1 changes in glioblastomas has been previously reported to predict survival. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) volume may better represent tumor burden. In this study, we report the first assessment of the dynamics of FLAIR volume changes over time as a predictive variable for post-resection overall survival (OS). Methods: Contemporary data from 103 consecutive patients with complete imaging and clinical data who underwent resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by the Stupp protocol between 2010 and 2013 were analyzed. Clinical, radiographic, and outcome parameters were retrieved for each patient, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetric tumor analysis before, immediately after, and 3 months post-surgery. Results: OS rate was 17.6 months. A significant incremental OS advantage was noted, with as little as 85 % T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (T1Gd)-EOTR measured on contrast-enhanced MRI. Pre- and immediate postoperative FLAIR-based EOTR was not predictive of OS; however, abnormal FLAIR volume measured 3 months post-surgery correlated significantly with outcome when FLAIR residual tumor volume (RTV) was <19.3 cm3 and <46 % of baseline volume (p < 0.0001 for both). Age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 mutation were predictive of OS (p < 0.0001, Cox proportional hazards). Conclusions: OS correlated with the immediate postoperative T1Gd-EOTR measured by enhanced T1 MRI, but not by FLAIR volume. Diminished abnormal FLAIR volume at 3 months post-surgery was associated with OS benefit when FLAIR-RTV was <19.3 cm3 or <46 % of baseline. These threshold values provide a new radiological variable that can be used for prediction of OS in patients with glioblastoma immediately after completion of standard chemoradiation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27766560
"""Frequent mitotic errors in tumor cells of genetically micro-heterogeneous glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by intratumoral heterogeneity as to both histomorphology and genetic changes, displaying a wide variety of numerical chromosome aberrations the most common of which are monosomy 10 and trisomy 7. Moreover, GBM in vitro are known to have variable karyotypes within a given tumor cell culture leading to rapid karyotype evolution through a high incidence of secondary numerical chromosome aberrations. The aim of our study was to investigate to what extent this mitotic instability of glioblastoma cells is also present in vivo. We assessed the spatial distribution patterns of numerical chromosome aberrations in vivo in a series of 24 GBM using two-color in situ hybridization for chromosomes 7/10, 8/17, and 12/18 on consecutive 6-microm paraffin-embedded tissue slides. The chromosome aberration patterns were compared with the histomorphology of the investigated tumor assessed from a consecutive HE-stained section, and with the in vitro karyotype of cell cultures established from the tumors. All investigated chromosomes showed mitotic instability, i.e., numerical aberrations within significant amounts of tumor cells in a scattered distribution through the tumor tissue. As to chromosomes 10 and 17, only monosomy occurred, as to chromosome 7 only trisomy/polysomy, apparently as a result of selection in favor of the respective aberration. Conversely, chromosomes 8, 12, and 18 displayed scattered patterns of monosomy as well as trisomy within a given tumor reflecting a high mitotic error rate without selective effects. The karyotypes of the tumor cell cultures showed less variability of numerical aberrations apparently due to clonal adaptation to in vitro conditions. We conclude that glioblastoma cells in vivo are characterized by an extensive tendency to mitotic errors. The resulting clonal diversity of chromosomally aberrant cells may be an important biological constituent of the well-known ability of glioblastomas to preserve viable tumor cell clones under adaptive stress in vivo, in clinical terms to rapidly recur after antitumoral therapy including radio- or chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11701945

With an evolving understanding of its underlying biology, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic molecular groups that can be subject to targeted therapy. This study established a cohort of 124 sequential glioblastomas from a tertiary hospital and aimed to find correlations between molecular features and survival outcomes. Comprehensive molecular characterization of the cohort revealed prevalent alterations as previously described, such as TERT promoter mutations and involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, CK4/6-CDKN2A/B-RB1, and p14ARF-MDM2-MDM4-p53 pathways. MGMT promoter methylation is a significant predictor of improved overall survival, aligned with previous data. Conversely, age showed a marginal association with higher mortality. Multivariate analysis to account for the effect of MGMT promoter methylation and age showed that, in contrast to other published series, this cohort demonstrated improved survival for tumors harboring PTEN mutations, and that there was no observed difference for most other molecular alterations, including EGFR amplification, RB1 loss, or the coexistence of EGFR amplification and deletion/exon skipping (EGFRvIII).

Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing vesicular stomatitis (VSV), Sindbis virus, pseudorabies virus (PRV), adeno-associated virus (AAV), and minute virus of mice i-strain (MVMi) and MVMp all infected glioblastoma cells. Mouse and human cytomegalovirus, and simian virus 40 showed only low levels of infection or GFP expression. VSV and Sindbis virus showed strong cytolytic actions and high rates of replication and spread, leading to an elimination of glioblastoma. PRV and both MVM strains generated more modest lytic effects and replication capacity. VSV showed a similar oncolytic profile on U-87 MG and M059J glioblastoma. In contrast, Sindbis virus showed strong preference for U-87 MG, whereas MVMi and MVMp preferred M059J. Sindbis virus and both MVM strains showed highly tumor-selective actions in glioblastoma plus fibroblast coculture. VSV and Sindbis virus were serially passaged on glioblastoma cells; we isolated a variant, VSV-rp30, that had increased selectivity and lytic capacity in glioblastoma cells. VSV and Sindbis virus were very effective at replicating, spreading within, and selectively killing human glioblastoma in an in vivo mouse model, whereas PRV and AAV remained at the injection site with minimal spread. Together, these data suggest that four (VSV, Sindbis virus, MVMi, and MVMp) of the nine viruses studied merit further analysis for potential therapeutic actions on glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15857987
"""Presurgical Identification of Patients With Glioblastoma at Risk for Cognitive Impairment at 3-Month Follow-up.""","""Background: Pre- and postoperative cognitive deficits have repeatedly been demonstrated in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Objective: To identify presurgical risk factors that facilitate the identification of GBM patients at risk for postoperative cognitive impairment. Methods: Patients underwent neuropsychological assessment using Central Nervous System Vital Signs 1 d before (T0) and 3 mo after surgery (T3). Patients' standardized scores on 7 cognitive domains were compared to a normative sample using one-sample z tests. Reliable change indices with correction for practice effects were calculated to assess cognitive changes in individual patients over time. Logistic regression models were performed to assess presurgical sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and cognitive risk factors for postoperative cognitive impairments. Results: At T0, 208 patients were assessed, and 136 patients were retested at T3. Patients showed significantly lower performance both prior to and 3 mo after surgery on all cognitive domains compared to healthy controls. Improvements and declines over time occurred respectively in 11% to 32% and 6% to 26% of the GBM patients over the domains. The regression models showed that low preoperative cognitive performance posits a significant risk factor for postoperative cognitive impairment on all domains, and female sex was a risk factor for postoperative impairments in Visual Memory. Conclusion: We demonstrated preoperative cognitive risk factors that enable the identification of GBM patients who are at risk for cognitive impairment 3 mo after surgery.

"""Unique combinations of epigenetic modifiers synergistically impair the viability of the U87 glioblastoma cell line while exhibiting minor or moderate effects on normal stem cell growth.""","""Discoveries made over the last decade have shown that critical changes in cancer cells, such as activation of oncogenes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes are caused not only by genetic but also by epigenetic mechanisms. While epigenetic alterations are somatically heritable, in contrast to genetic changes, they are potentially reversible, making them perfect targets for therapeutic intervention. Covalent modifications of chromatin, such as methylation of DNA and acetylation and methylation of histones, are important components of epigenetic machinery. Multiple recent studies have shown that epigenetic modifiers are candidates for potent new drugs in multiple cancers' therapies, including gliomas, and several clinical trials are ongoing. However, as with other chemotherapeutic drugs, toxicity is one of the main concerns with some of the potent epigenetic drugs. Synergistic combinations of these agents are one approach to overcoming toxicity issues while enhancing efficacy. In this study, we demonstrated that while individually BIX01294, an inhibitor of histone methyltransferase G9a, DZNep, an inhibitor of lysine methyltransferase EZH2, and Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase at their low concentrations showed a moderate effect on the viability of U87 glioblastoma cells, in combinations they exhibited a synergistic effect. Importantly, these combinations exhibited minimal effect on adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) growth.

"""Transcription factor NRF2 uses the Hippo pathway effector TAZ to induce tumorigenesis in glioblastomas.""","""Transcription factor NRF2 orchestrates a cellular defense against oxidative stress and, so far, has been involved in tumor progression by providing a metabolic adaptation to tumorigenic demands and resistance to chemotherapeutics. In this study, we discover that NRF2 also propels tumorigenesis in gliomas and glioblastomas by inducing the expression of the transcriptional co-activator TAZ, a protein of the Hippo signaling pathway that promotes tumor growth. The expression of the genes encoding NRF2 (NFE2L2) and TAZ (WWTR1) showed a positive correlation in 721 gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Moreover, NRF2 and TAZ protein levels also correlated in immunohistochemical tissue arrays of glioblastomas. Genetic knock-down of NRF2 decreased, while NRF2 overexpression or chemical activation with sulforaphane, increased TAZ transcript and protein levels. Mechanistically, we identified several NRF2-regulated functional enhancers in the regulatory region of WWTR1. The relevance of the new NRF2/TAZ axis in tumorigenesis was demonstrated in subcutaneous and intracranial grafts. Thus, intracranial inoculation of NRF2-depleted glioma stem cells did not develop tumors as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Forced TAZ overexpression partly rescued both stem cell growth in neurospheres and tumorigenicity. Hence, NRF2 not only enables tumor cells to be competent to proliferate but it also propels tumorigenesis by activating the TAZ-mediated Hippo transcriptional program.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31918259

Experimental design: This multicenter cohort study included a developmental cohort of 622 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas from a single institution (Severance Hospital) and validation cohorts of 536 patients from three institutions (Seoul National University Hospital, Asan Medical Center, and Heidelberg University Hospital). All patients completed standard treatment including concurrent chemoradiotherapy and underwent testing to determine their IDH mutation and MGMTp methylation status. EORs were categorized into either supramaximal, total, or non-total resections. A novel RPA model was then developed and compared with a previous Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) RPA model. Results: In the developmental cohort, the RPA model included age, MGMTp methylation status, Karnofsky performance status, and EOR. Younger patients with MGMTp methylation and supramaximal resections showed a more favorable prognosis [class I: median overall survival (OS) 57.3 months], whereas low-performing patients with non-total resections and without MGMTp methylation showed the worst prognosis (class IV: median OS 14.3 months). The prognostic significance of the RPA was subsequently confirmed in the validation cohorts, which revealed a greater separation between prognostic classes for all cohorts compared with the previous RTOG RPA model. Conclusions: The proposed RPA model highlights the impact of supramaximal versus total resections and incorporates clinical and molecular factors into survival stratification. The RPA model may improve the accuracy of assessing prognostic groups. See related commentary by Karschnia et al., p. 4811.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38829906
"""PASNet: pathway-associated sparse deep neural network for prognosis prediction from high-throughput data.""","""Background: Predicting prognosis in patients from large-scale genomic data is a fundamentally challenging problem in genomic medicine. However, the prognosis still remains poor in many diseases. The poor prognosis may be caused by high complexity of biological systems, where multiple biological components and their hierarchical relationships are involved. Moreover, it is challenging to develop robust computational solutions with high-dimension, low-sample size data. Results: In this study, we propose a Pathway-Associated Sparse Deep Neural Network (PASNet) that not only predicts patients' prognoses but also describes complex biological processes regarding biological pathways for prognosis. PASNet models a multilayered, hierarchical biological system of genes and pathways to predict clinical outcomes by leveraging deep learning. The sparse solution of PASNet provides the capability of model interpretability that most conventional fully-connected neural networks lack. We applied PASNet for long-term survival prediction in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is a primary brain cancer that shows poor prognostic performance. The predictive performance of PASNet was evaluated with multiple cross-validation experiments. PASNet showed a higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1-score than previous long-term survival prediction classifiers, and the significance of PASNet's performance was assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Furthermore, the biological pathways, found in PASNet, were referred to as significant pathways in GBM in previous biology and medicine research. Conclusions: PASNet can describe the different biological systems of clinical outcomes for prognostic prediction as well as predicting prognosis more accurately than the current state-of-the-art methods. PASNet is the first pathway-based deep neural network that represents hierarchical representations of genes and pathways and their nonlinear effects, to the best of our knowledge.

We describe gene expression imaging tools which allow mapping of brain regions where gene expression has significant influence on TAS, and apply these methods to study 77 patients who underwent surgical evaluation for supratentorial glioblastomas. Tumor size and location were measured from MRI scans. A 9-set gene expression profile predicting long-term survivors was obtained from RNA derived from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue.

Although the expression of only OLIG2 was significantly lower in patients with TAS in a groupwise analysis, gene expression imaging analysis revealed regions with significantly lower expression of OLIG2 and RTN1 in patients with TAS.

The present study investigates their relationship with microvascularization and the prognostic effect in primary glioblastoma. Methods: Tumor tissues from 61 glioblastomas were analyzed using immunohistochemistry for DLL4/JAG1 expression and microvascular formations. The correlations between DLL4/JAG1 and microvascularization were analyzed. The survival probabilities were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis of time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Results: The results showed increased DLL4 and JAG1 expression in glioblastoma tissues. Five types of basic microvascular formations, including microvascular sprouting, vascular cluster, vascular garland, glomeruloid vascular proliferation, and vasculogenic mimicry, were detected. Glioblastomas with the type I microvascular pattern (MVP) that displayed prominent microvascular sprouting and vascular clusters tended to have higher DLL4 expression, whereas those with the type II MVP that had numerous vascular garlands, glomeruloid vascular proliferations, and vasculogenic mimicries showed upregulated JAG1 expression. Univariate analysis documented that high DLL4 expression, high JAG1 expression, and type II (MVP) were statistically associated with reduced TTP and OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed high DLL4 expression, high JAG1 expression, and type II MVP as significant prognostic factors for both shorter TTP and OS, independent of age, Karnofsky performance scale, and other molecular markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, Ki67, and P53). Conclusions: DLL4 and JAG1 may have opposing effects on tumor angiogenesis in glioblastoma.

"""NRBF2-mediated autophagy contributes to metabolite replenishment and radioresistance in glioblastoma.""","""Overcoming therapeutic resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) is an essential strategy for improving cancer therapy. However, cancer cells possess various evasion mechanisms, such as metabolic reprogramming, which promote cell survival and limit therapy. The diverse metabolic fuel sources that are produced by autophagy provide tumors with metabolic plasticity and are known to induce drug or radioresistance in GBM. This study determined that autophagy, a common representative cell homeostasis mechanism, was upregulated upon treatment of GBM cells with ionizing radiation (IR). Nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (NRBF2)-a positive regulator of the autophagy initiation step-was found to be upregulated in a GBM orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, ATP production and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) increased upon activation of NRBF2-mediated autophagy. It was also discovered that changes in metabolic state were induced by alterations in metabolite levels caused by autophagy, thereby causing radioresistance. In addition, we found that lidoflazine-a vasodilator agent discovered through drug repositioning-significantly suppressed IR-induced migration, invasion, and proliferation by inhibiting NRBF2, resulting in a reduction in autophagic flux in both in vitro models and in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse models.

"""Stereotactic radiosurgery for IDH wild type glioblastoma: an international, multicenter study.""","""Objective: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is recommended used for diagnosis and prognostication of glioblastoma patients. We studied efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with recurrent IDH-wt glioblastoma. Methods: Consecutive patients treated with SRS for IDH-wt glioblastoma were pooled for this retrospective observational international multi-institutional study from institutions participating in the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation. Results: Sixty patients (median age 61 years) underwent SRS (median dose 15 Gy and median treatment volume: 7.01 cm3) for IDH-wt glioblastoma. All patients had histories of surgery and chemotherapy with temozolomide, and 98% underwent fractionated radiation therapy. MGMT status was available for 42 patients, of which half of patients had MGMT mutant glioblastomas. During median post-SRS imaging follow-up of 6 months, 52% of patients experienced tumor progression. Median post-SRS progression free survival was 4 months. SRS prescription dose of > 14 Gy predicted longer progression free survival [HR 0.357 95% (0.164-0.777) p = 0.009]. Fifty-percent of patients died during post-SRS clinical follow-up that ranged from 1 to 33 months. SRS treatment volume of > 5 cc emerged as an independent predictor of shorter post-SRS overall survival [HR 2.802 95% CI (1.219-6.444) p = 0.02]. Adverse radiation events (ARE) suggestive of radiation necrosis were diagnosed in 6/55 (10%) patients and were managed conservatively in the majority of patients. Conclusions: SRS prescription dose of > 14 Gy is associated with longer progression free survival while tumor volume of > 5 cc is associated with shorter overall survival after SRS for IDH-wt glioblastomas.

This study is designed to clarify the significance of p16INK4 hypermethylation in 23 cases of glioblastomas (GBMs) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and p16 immunostaining. Fourteen cases (60.9%) out of 23 GBMs revealed hypermethylation on p16. p16 immunostaining revealed that 13 (93%) of these 14 hypermethylation cases showed complete loss of immunoreactivity and only one (7%) case retained immunoreactivity. Among 9 methylation-negative cases, 4 were immunonegative, which might be related to mutations or deletions other than hypermethylation. The most significant finding was that of 17 cases with immunonegativity, 13 cases (76.5%) showed hypermethylation.

Here, we present fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) data regarding the reversion of third generation co-cultured U87+DBTRG and patient-derived GBM tumor model after treatment with novel IL17A inhibitor named FLVM and FLVZ (organic derivatives of caffeic acid). FMT was used to determine tumor angiogenesis volume (assessment of number of blood vessel; the expression of angiogenic factors CD34 and other angiogenic cancer bio-markers) in U87+DBTRG and patient-derived gliomas. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine microvessel density [CD34], and cell proliferation [Ki67].

"""Transformation of low grade glioma and correlation with outcome: an NCCTG database analysis.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) may originate de novo (primary), or following transformation from a lower grade glioma (secondary), and it has been postulated that these tumors may have different biological behaviors. We performed a correlative analysis involving 204 patients with glioma treated prospectively on NCCTG clinical trials. Central pathology review of tumor tissues taken at the time of initial diagnosis and at recurrence were performed in all patients. Tumors progressed from low (WHO grade 2) to high (grade 3-4) at recurrence in 45% low grade oligodendroglioma patients, in 70% with low grade oligoastrocytoma, and 74% with low grade astrocytoma (P = 0.031). Median overall survival (OS) from initial diagnosis varied by histology: oligodendroglioma, 8.8 years; (95% CI 5.7-10.2); oligoastrocytoma, 4.4 years (95% CI 3.5-5.6); astrocytoma grade 2 3.1 years (astrocytoma grade 2-4, 2.1 years) (95% CI 1.7-2.5, P < 0.001). Mean time to recurrence (TTR) also varied between patients with de novo GBM, those secondary GBM, and those that remained non-GBM at recurrence (1.1 ± 1.1 vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 vs. 4.0 ± 2.9 years, respectively, P < 0.001).

"""High CHI3L1 expression is associated with glioma patient survival.""","""Background: Survival of glioma patients with the same tumor histology and grade can vary significantly, and some low-grade gliomas transform to a more malignant phenotype. There is a need of molecular signatures, which are better predictors of the patient diagnosis, outcome of treatment, and prognosis than the diagnosis provided by histopathology. We propose CHI3L1 mRNA expression as a prognostic biomarker for patients with glioma. Methods: We measured CHI3L1 expression with quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the cohort of 98 patients with different grade glioma: 10 grade I pylocytic astrocytomas, 30 grade II diffuse astrocytomas, 20 grade III anaplastic astrocytomas, and 38 grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastomas). Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the association between CHI3L1 mRNA expression levels and patient clinical variables. Results: We demonstrated that mRNA expression of CHI3L1 was evidently higher in glioblastoma than in lower grade glioma tissues. We evaluated correlations between CHI3L1 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and the outcomes of the patients. Patients with high CHI3L1 expression had a shorter overall survival (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Findings presented in our study showed that increased mRNA level of CHI3L1 could be associated with the progression of astrocytoma and poor patient survival not only for glioblastoma, but for lower grade astrocytoma tumors as well. Further investigation will be required to evaluate CHI3L1 value as a molecular marker for astrocytoma prognoses and for novel treatment strategies against all grade astrocytomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121858
"""Molecular analysis of microdissected de novo glioblastomas and paired astrocytic tumors.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) often displays morphological heterogeneity in that low-grade (LG) area with well-differentiated cells are commonly found adjacent to high-grade (HG) area with poorly-differentiated cells. This heterogeneity may cause difficulty in obtaining representative tumor samples. Nevertheless, the genetic composition of these cells has only been occasionally examined. In the present study, we examined 29 de novo glioblastomas in which distinct LG and HG areas of sufficient volumes could be identified. These areas were microdissected from paraffin-embedded tissues and analyzed for genetic alterations: p53 mutations and immunohistochemistry; allelic losses at 17p13.1, 9p21, and 10q23-25; and amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and immunohistochemistry. We also examined 14 paired astrocytic tumors, in which a primary Grade II astrocytoma progressed over a period of time to a Grade III or Grade IV tumor. Our findings showed that the LG areas of the de novo glioblastomas exhibited numerous genetic aberrations, the proportion of which was increased in the HG areas. Genetic abnormalities seen in the LG areas were conserved in the HG areas suggesting that these morphologically different cellular subsets were derived from a common transformed clone. Also, the LG areas were genetically different from Grade II astrocytomas of the paired tumor group, in spite of their morphological similarity. In particular, the LG areas had more deletions on 10q23-25 (75% vs 20%, p = 0.04), but fewer p53 mutations (24% vs 71%, p = 0.003) and less p53 protein labeling (45% vs 79%, p = 0.04). These differences suggest that LG and HG areas in de novo glioblastoma are genetically closer to each other compared with paired low- and high-grade tumors that have progressed over time. Moreover, only a small proportion (17%) of our de novo glioblastomas exhibited EGFR amplification while a high proportion (62%) showed either p53 mutations or allelic loss of 17p13.1. We speculate that some de novo GBMs with copious LG areas may constitute a separate group with rapid progression from Grade II astrocytomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10029095

Here, we present a novel nutrient-dependent multiscale sensitivity analysis of this model that helps to identify those reaction parameters of the molecular interaction network that influence the tumour progression on the cellular scale the most. In particular, those parameters are identified that essentially determine tumour expansion and could be therefore used as potential therapy targets. As indicators for the success of a potential therapy target, a deceleration of the tumour expansion and a reduction of the tumour volume are employed. From the results, it can be concluded that no single parameter variation results in a less aggressive tumour. However, it can be shown that a few combined perturbations of two systematically selected parameters cause a slow-down of the tumour expansion velocity accompanied with a decrease of the tumour volume. Those parameters are primarily linked to the reactions that involve the microRNA-451 and the thereof regulated protein MO25.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24899919

To elucidate whether, in principle, similar splice-variants could be involved in glioma cell invasion we examined the expression of CD44 and its splice-variants in a series of 38 primary human brain tumors (28 astrocytomas, WHO grade I-III and 10 glioblastomas, WHO grade IV) and in cell lines derived from 9 glioblastomas. All brain tumors examined showed strong immunoreactivity for an N-terminal epitope present on all CD44 isoforms known. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the complete sequence encoded by variant exons v3 to v10, CD44 splice-variants could be detected irrespective of the grade of malignancy in many of the tumor samples at a low level and often restricted to only a few clustered tumor cells. Thus, the N-terminal epitope probably indicates the presence of the smallest and most ubiquitous isoform CD44s. Interestingly, all glioblastomas expressed CD44 variants whereas expression in astrocytomas WHO grade I, II, and III could only be detected in about half of the tumor samples. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR we were able to detect different CD44 splice-variants in the glioblastoma cell lines and in cultured primary astrocytic cells. Glioblastoma cells analyzed by flow cytometry showed the expected binding capacity for hyaluronic acid which could be increased twofold after pretreatment with hyaluronidase. The results presented show that there is low expression of CD44 variants in human tumors of astrocytic origin.

Here, we aimed to identify molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. Patients and methods: Gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas were interrogated for associations with resistance to therapy. Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. Results: An expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin-1 (CD133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.26; P = .004). This association could be validated in an independent data set. Provocatively, the HOX cluster was reminiscent of a 'self-renewal' signature (P = .008; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) recently characterized in a mouse leukemia model. The HOX signature and EGFR expression were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, adjusted for the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, a known predictive factor for benefit from temozolomide, and age. Better outcome was associated with gene clusters characterizing features of tumor-host interaction including tumor vascularization and cell adhesion, and innate immune response.

GLUT1 is essential to central nervous system glycometabolism. To clarify the exact role of GLUT1 in glioblastoma, we assessed the expression and localization of GLUT1 in patient samples by immunohistochemistry and in situ RNA hybridization. This revealed that GLUT1 was mainly expressed on perivascular and pseudopalisaded tumor cell membranes. All samples expressed GLUT1 to some degree, with 30.8% showing stronger staining. On the basis of these data, samples were divided into high and low expression groups, although SLC2A1 mRNA expression was also higher in the high GLUT1 expression group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that high GLUT1 expression associated with lower overall survival (log-rank test, p = 0.001) and worse patient prognoses (p = 0.001). Finally, MIB-1 staining was stronger in high GLUT1 expression samples (p = 0.0004), suggesting a link with proliferation.

DTI metrics as well as the normalized signal intensity from the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were measured from each region. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the best model for classification. The results demonstrated that FA, CL and CP from glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases from all segmented regions (p<0.05), and the differences from the enhancing regions were most significant (p<0.001). FA and CL from the enhancing region had the highest prediction accuracy when used alone with an area under the curve of 0.90. The best logistic regression model included three parameters (ADC, FA and CP) from the enhancing part, resulting in 92% sensitivity, 100% specificity and area under the curve of 0.98. We conclude that DTI metrics, used individually or combined, have a potential as a non-invasive measure to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18951985
"""Identification of RNA-Binding Protein LARP4B as a Tumor Suppressor in Glioma.""","""Transposon-based insertional mutagenesis is a valuable method for conducting unbiased forward genetic screens to identify cancer genes in mice. We used this system to elucidate factors involved in the malignant transformation of neural stem cells into glioma-initiating cells. We identified an RNA-binding protein, La-related protein 4b (LARP4B), as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in glioma. LARP4B expression was consistently decreased in human glioma stem cells and cell lines compared with normal neural stem cells. Moreover, heterozygous deletion of LARP4B was detected in nearly 80% of glioblastomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. LARP4B loss was also associated with low expression and poor patient survival. Overexpression of LARP4B in glioma cell lines strongly inhibited proliferation by inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis in four of six lines as well as in two patient-derived glioma stem cell populations. The expression levels of CDKN1A and BAX were also upregulated upon LARP4B overexpression, and the growth-inhibitory effects were partially dependent on p53 (TP53) activity in cells expressing wild-type, but not mutant, p53. We further found that the La module, which is responsible for the RNA chaperone activity of LARP4B, was important for the growth-suppressive effect and was associated with BAX mRNA. Finally, LARP4B depletion in p53 and Nf1-deficient mouse primary astrocytes promoted cell proliferation and led to increased tumor size and invasiveness in xenograft and orthotopic models. These data provide strong evidence that LARP4B serves as a tumor-suppressor gene in glioma, encouraging further exploration of the RNA targets potentially involved in LARP4B-mediatd growth inhibition.

"""Enhanced expression of coproporphyrinogen oxidase in malignant brain tumors: CPOX expression and 5-ALA-induced fluorescence.""","""In photodynamic diagnosis, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is widely used for the fluorescence-guided resection of malignant brain tumors, where 5-ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX, which exhibits strong fluorescence. Little is known, however, about the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. To resolve this issue, we analyzed transcriptome profiles for the genes encoding enzymes, transporters, and a transcription factor involved in the porphyrin-biosynthesis pathway. By quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR, we measured the mRNA levels of those genes in a total of 20 tumor samples that had been surgically resected from brain tumor patients at the Department of Neurosurgery of Osaka Medical College from 2008 to 2009. We selected 10 tumor samples with no 5-ALA-induced fluorescence, among which 2 were glioblastomas and 8 were metastatic brain tumors. Another 10 tumor samples were selected with strong fluorescence, among which 7 were glioblastomas and 3 were metastatic brain tumors. The qRT-PCR analysis study of these latter 10 samples revealed predominantly high levels of the mRNA of the coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) gene. The high mRNA level of CPOX expression was significantly well correlated with the phenotype of strong 5-ALA-induced fluorescence (P = .0003). These findings were further confirmed by immunohistochemical studies with a CPOX-specific antibody. It is concluded that induction of CPOX gene expression is one of the key molecular mechanisms underlying the 5-ALA-induced fluorescence of malignant brain tumors. The induction mechanism for the CPOX gene in brain tumors remains to be elucidated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21824890
"""Quantitative assessment of intragenic receptor tyrosine kinase deletions in primary glioblastomas: their prevalence and molecular correlates.""","""Intragenic deletion is the most common form of activating mutation among receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in glioblastoma. However, these events are not detected by conventional DNA sequencing methods commonly utilized for tumor genotyping. To comprehensively assess the frequency, distribution, and expression levels of common RTK deletion mutants in glioblastoma, we analyzed RNA from a set of 192 glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas for the expression of EGFRvIII, EGFRvII, EGFRvV (carboxyl-terminal deletion), and PDGFRAΔ8,9. These mutations were detected in 24, 1.6, 4.7, and 1.6 % of cases, respectively. Overall, 29 % (55/189) of glioblastomas expressed at least one RTK intragenic deletion transcript in this panel. For EGFRvIII, samples were analyzed by both quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and single mRNA molecule counting on the Nanostring nCounter platform. Nanostring proved to be highly sensitive, specific, and linear, with sensitivity comparable or exceeding that of RNA seq. We evaluated the prognostic significance and molecular correlates of RTK rearrangements. EGFRvIII was only detectable in tumors with focal amplification of the gene. Moreover, we found that EGFRvIII expression was not prognostic of poor outcome and that neither recurrent copy number alterations nor global changes in gene expression differentiate EGFRvIII-positive tumors from tumors with amplification of wild-type EGFR. The wide range of expression of mutant alleles and co-expression of multiple EGFR variants suggests that quantitative RNA-based clinical assays will be important for assessing the relative expression of intragenic deletions as therapeutic targets and/or candidate biomarkers. To this end, we demonstrate the performance of the Nanostring assay in RNA derived from routinely collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24292886

In addition, we examined methylation status of MGMT promoter by methylation-specific real-time PCR, as this has been shown to be a predictive marker in glioblastomas.

"""Identification of regions correlating MGMT promoter methylation and gene expression in glioblastomas.""","""The O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) is methylated in several cancers, including gliomas. However, the functional role of cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island (CGI) methylation in MGMT silencing is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MGMT CGI methylation correlates inversely with RNA expression of MGMT in glioblastomas and to determine the CpG region whose methylation best reflects the level of expression. The methylation level of CpG sites that are potentially related to expression was investigated in 54 glioblastomas by pyrosequencing, a highly quantitative method, and analyzed with respect to their MGMT mRNA expression status. Three groups of patients were identified according to the methylation pattern of all 52 analyzed CpG sites. Overall, an 85% rate of concordance was observed between methylation and expression (p < 0.0001). When analyzing each CpG separately, six CpG sites were highly correlated with expression (p < 0.0001), and two CpG regions could be used as surrogate markers for RNA expression in 81.5% of the patients. This study indicates that there is good statistical agreement between MGMT methylation and expression, and that some CpG regions better reflect MGMT expression than do others. However, if transcriptional repression is the key mechanism in explaining the higher chemosensitivity of MGMT-methylated tumors, a substantial rate of discordance should lead clinicians to be cautious when deciding on a therapeutic strategy based on MGMT methylation status alone.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19224763

We evaluated the relationship of epigenetic GBM subgroups with immune cell infiltrations, systemic immune changes during radiochemotherapy, and clinical outcome. Methods: 450K genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed on tumor tissue from 93 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, treated with standard radiochemotherapy and experimental immunotherapy. Tumor infiltration of T cells, myeloid cells, and Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression were evaluated. Circulating immune cell populations and selected cytokines were assessed on blood samples taken before and after radiochemotherapy. Results: Forty-two tumors had a mesenchymal, 27 a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) II, 17 RTK I, and 7 an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) DNA methylation pattern. Mesenchymal tumors had the highest amount of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ and CD8+ T cells and IDH tumors the lowest. There were no significant differences for CD68+ cells, FoxP3+ cells, and PD-1 expression between groups. Systemically, there was a relative increase of CD8+ T cells and CD8+ PD-1 expression and a relative decrease of CD4+ T cells after radiochemotherapy in all subgroups except IDH tumors. Overall survival was the longest in the IDH group (median 36 mo), intermediate in RTK II tumors (27 mo), and significantly lower in mesenchymal and RTK I groups (15.5 and 16 mo, respectively). Conclusions: Methylation based stratification of GBM is related to T-cell infiltration and survival, with IDH and mesenchymal tumors representing both ends of a spectrum.

Little information is available on the clinical significance of various molecular markers in pediatric grade IV astrocytomas. The current study was focused on the molecular analysis and clinico-pathological correlations in a set of 44 tumor samples obtained from pediatric patients with nonbrainstem glioblastomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a set of 10 commercial chromosome probes (1p36, 1q25, centromere (CEP)7, EGFR, CEP9, 9p21/p16, CEP10, 10q23/PTEN, 19p13, and 19q13) was performed. Disclosed molecular abnormalities, in descending order of frequency, included polysomy 7 (72%), loss of 10q23 (61%), loss of 9p21 (52%), loss of 1p36 (41%), gain of 1q25 (25%), polysomy 9 (16%), EGFR amplification (9%), loss of 19q13 (5%), polysomy 19 (5%), and codeletion 1p36/19q13 (2%). The overall survival time was markedly shorter only for those patients whose lesions harbored deletion of 10q23/PTEN locus (log-rank test; P=0.00007). By multivariate analysis, only loss of 10q23 locus reached an independent level of prognostic value (hazard ratio=2.88; P=0.01). There were no significant differences in patient survival for other molecular abnormalities. In conclusion, a FISH analysis of 10q23 dosage should be recommended as an ancillary laboratory method that allows further clinical subdivision of pediatric glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832192
"""Anti-tumour immune response in GL261 glioblastoma generated by Temozolomide Immune-Enhancing Metronomic Schedule monitored with MRSI-based nosological images.""","""Glioblastomas (GB) are brain tumours with poor prognosis even after aggressive therapy. Improvements in both therapeutic and follow-up strategies are urgently needed. In previous work we described an oscillatory pattern of response to Temozolomide (TMZ) using a standard administration protocol, detected through MRSI-based machine learning approaches. In the present work, we have introduced the Immune-Enhancing Metronomic Schedule (IMS) with an every 6-d TMZ administration at 60 mg/kg and investigated the consistence of such oscillatory behaviour. A total of n = 17 GL261 GB tumour-bearing C57BL/6j mice were studied with MRI/MRSI every 2 d, and the oscillatory behaviour (6.2 ± 1.5 d period from the TMZ administration day) was confirmed during response. Furthermore, IMS-TMZ produced significant improvement in mice survival (22.5 ± 3.0 d for controls vs 135.8 ± 78.2 for TMZ-treated), outperforming standard TMZ treatment. Histopathological correlation was investigated in selected tumour samples (n = 6) analyzing control and responding fields. Significant differences were found for CD3+ cells (lymphocytes, 3.3 ± 2.5 vs 4.8 ± 2.9, respectively) and Iba-1 immunostained area (microglia/macrophages, 16.8% ± 9.7% and 21.9% ± 11.4%, respectively). Unexpectedly, during IMS-TMZ treatment, tumours from some mice (n = 6) fully regressed and remained undetectable without further treatment for 1 mo. These animals were considered 'cured' and a GL261 re-challenge experiment performed, with no tumour reappearance in five out of six cases. Heterogeneous therapy response outcomes were detected in tumour-bearing mice, and a selected group was investigated (n = 3 non-responders, n = 6 relapsing tumours, n = 3 controls). PD-L1 content was found ca. 3-fold increased in the relapsing group when comparing with control and non-responding groups, suggesting that increased lymphocyte inhibition could be associated to IMS-TMZ failure. Overall, data suggest that host immune response has a relevant role in therapy response/escape in GL261 tumours under IMS-TMZ therapy. This is associated to changes in the metabolomics pattern, oscillating every 6 d, in agreement with immune cycle length, which is being sampled by MRSI-derived nosological images.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31926117

We aim to test the hypothesis that DeEA possesses significant cytotoxic effects against glioblastomas, one of the most frequent and malignant brain tumors in adults. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase release assays indicated that DeEA inhibited the proliferation of the human glioblastoma cell U87MG. In addition, Annexin V and propidium iodide staining showed that DeEA treatment led to a rapid increase of glioblastomas in the necrotic/late apoptotic fraction, whereas cell cycle analysis revealed that DeEA failed to significantly enhance the population of U87MG cells in the hypodiploid (sub-G1) fraction. Using electron microscopy, we found that DeEA induced significant cell enlargements, massive cytoplasmic vacuolization, and loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. DeEA treatment triggered an intracellular Ca(2+) increase, and DeEA-induced cell death was significantly attenuated by BAPTA-AM but not ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. DeEA instigated a reduction of both mitochondrial transmembrane potential and intracellular ATP level. Moreover, DeEA induced proteolysis of alpha-spectrin by calpain, and DeEA cytotoxicity in U87MG cells was caspase-independent but was effectively blocked by calpain inhibitor. Interestingly, DeEA also caused autophagic response that was prevented by calpain inhibitor. Taken together, these results suggest that in human glioblastomas, DeEA induces necrotic cell death that involves Ca(2+) overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calpain activation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19848398
"""The PEA-15/PED protein protects glioblastoma cells from glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway.""","""PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kDa) is a death effector domain-containing protein, which is involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death. Since PEA-15 is highly expressed in cells of glial origin, we studied the role of PEA-15 in human malignant brain tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of PEA-15 expression shows strong immunoreactivity in astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Phosphorylation of PEA-15 at Ser(116) is found in vivo in perinecrotic areas in glioblastomas and in vitro after glucose deprivation of glioblastoma cells. Overexpression of PEA-15 induces a marked resistance against glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis, whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of endogenous PEA-15 results in the sensitization to glucose withdrawal-mediated cell death. This antiapoptotic activity of PEA-15 under low glucose conditions depends on its phosphorylation at Ser(116). Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PEA-15 abolishes the tumorigenicity of U87MG glioblastoma cells in vivo. PEA-15 regulates the level of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in glioblastoma cells and the PEA-15-dependent protection from glucose deprivation-induced cell death requires ERK1/2 signaling. PEA-15 transcriptionally upregulates the Glucose Transporter 3, which is abrogated by the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings suggest that Ser(116)-phosphorylated PEA-15 renders glioma cells resistant to glucose deprivation-mediated cell death as encountered in poor microenvironments, for example in perinecrotic areas of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17700518
"""Notch-1 activation-dependent p53 restoration contributes to resveratrol-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma is the most malignant form of adult brain tumor and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Emerging data suggest that Notch signaling participates principally in the formation and malignant progression of glioblastoma. Resveratrol is a terpenoid that exhibits broad pro-apoptotic activity in various types of cancers, including glioblastoma. However, the effects of resveratrol on Notch signaling in glioblastomas have not yet been fully elucidated. We demonstrated that resveratrol strongly suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in A172 and T98G glioblastoma cells, which have low active Notch-1 expression and a heterozygous p53 mutation. Our results suggest that resveratrol significantly activates intracellular Notch-1 and restores wild-type p53 expression in a time-dependent manner. Significant de-phosphorylation of Akt, increased Bax expression, decreased Bcl-2 expression and cleavage of caspase-3 were also observed in resveratrol-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Moreover, simultaneous treatment with resveratrol and a Notch-1 inhibitor (MRK-003) partially attenuated the apoptosis and completely blocked the activation of Notch-1 and the increase in wild-type p53. This suggests that restoration of wild-type p53 expression depends on Notch-1 activation. In addition, the de-phosphorylation of Akt, increased expression of Bax and cleavage of caspase-3 were not fully reversed by MRK-003 treatment, suggesting that p53 restoration is not the only mechanism underlying resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Taken together, we confirmed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of resveratrol on glioblastoma cells and revealed Notch-1 activation-dependent restoration of p53 as an important causative mechanism.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21743969
"""Arginine Deprivation Therapy: Putative Strategy to Eradicate Glioblastoma Cells by Radiosensitization.""","""Tumor cells-even if nonauxotrophic-are often highly sensitive to arginine deficiency. We hypothesized that arginine deprivation therapy (ADT) if combined with irradiation could be a new treatment strategy for glioblastoma (GBM) patients because systemic ADT is independent of local penetration and diffusion limitations. A proof-of-principle in vitro study was performed with ADT being mimicked by application of recombinant human arginase or arginine-free diets. ADT inhibited two-dimensional (2-D) growth and cell-cycle progression, and reduced growth recovery after completion of treatment in four different GBM cell line models. Cells were less susceptible to ADT alone in the presence of citrulline and in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment. Migration and 3-D invasion were not unfavorably affected. However, ADT caused a significant radiosensitization that was more pronounced in a GBM cell model with p53 loss of function as compared with its p53-wildtype counterpart. The synergistic effect was independent of basic and induced argininosuccinate synthase or argininosuccinate lyase protein expression and not abrogated by the presence of citrulline. The radiosensitizing potential was maintained or even more distinguishable in a 3-D environment as verified in p53-knockdown and p53-wildtype U87-MG cells via a 60-day spheroid control probability assay. Although the underlying mechanism is still ambiguous, the observation of ADT-induced radiosensitization is of great clinical interest, in particular for patients with GBM showing high radioresistance and/or p53 loss of function.

Strong nuclear expression of HIF-1alpha protein was seen in the majority of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, particularly surrounding areas of necrosis in glioblastomas. In the majority of these tumours upregulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA was also demonstrated, with a significant increase in glioblastomas compared to lower grade tumours. No correlation was found between the presence of HIF-1alpha protein and immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein.

However, systemic administration of 9NC has not shown the expected efficacy in clinical trials. This failure may be due to the rapid hydrolysis of 9NC in plasma from the active form to the inactive and myelosuppressive form in the presence of human albumin at physiologic pH. Concurrent treatment with anticonvulsants and dexamethasone, drugs indispensable for the supportive therapy of patients with GBM, has also been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of these drugs. Intrathecal drug delivery circumvents the blood-brain barrier and minimizes systemic toxicity. Intrathecal delivery of 9NC may also have the more specific advantage of significantly reducing the hydrolysis of 9NC that occurs after systemic delivery due to the more favorable pH and reduced albumin content in cerebrospinal fluid. The present study evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of 9NC in an athymic rat model of neoplastic meningitis. Toxicity tests showed that 0.3 micromol (5000 microM), 0.03 micromol (500 microM), 0.003 micromol (50 microM), or 0.0003 micromol (5 microM) of 9NC administered intrathecally to the athymic rats caused no evidence of clinical or histological toxicity. Intrathecal administration of 0.3 micromol (5000 microM) of 9NC twice a week for three doses to athymic rats with neoplastic meningitis induced by the GBM cell line, U87MGDeltaEGFR, resulted in a 26% increase of median survival compared to the control group (p < 0.005).

Gliomas exhibit high genetic diversity in addition to complex and variable clinical features. Glioblastoma tumors are highly resistant to multimodal therapies and there is significant patient mortality within the first two years after prognosis.

Glioblastomas contain a high number of microglia and infiltrating macrophages, which are positively correlated with glioma grade and invasiveness. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. These cells constantly scan the brain and react promptly to any abnormality, removing detrimental factors and safeguarding the central nervous system against further damage. Microglia and macrophages that have colonized the glioblastoma display protumoral functions and promote tumor growth. The optically transparent zebrafish larva facilitates imaging of fluorescently labeled cells at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. It is therefore an excellent model to investigate microglia-glioma cell interactions at the early stages of tumor development.

The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been unclear how well different patient-derived GBM models are able to recreate the full heterogeneity of primary tumors.
