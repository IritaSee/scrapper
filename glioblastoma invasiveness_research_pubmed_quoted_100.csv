"""Glioblastoma hijacks neuronal mechanisms for brain invasion.""","""Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a LÃ©vy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma's dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35914528
"""Multidimensional communication in the microenvirons of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are heterogeneous and invariably lethal tumours. They are characterized by genetic and epigenetic variations among tumour cells, which makes the development of therapies that eradicate all tumour cells challenging and currently impossible. An important component of glioblastoma growth is communication with and manipulation of other cells in the brain environs, which supports tumour progression and resistance to therapy. Glioblastoma cells recruit innate immune cells and change their phenotype to support tumour growth. Tumour cells also suppress adaptive immune responses, and our increasing understanding of how T cells access the brain and how the tumour thwarts the immune response offers new strategies for mobilizing an antitumour response. Tumours also subvert normal brain cells - including endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes - to create a microenviron that favours tumour success. Overall, after glioblastoma-induced phenotypic modifications, normal cells cooperate with tumour cells to promote tumour proliferation, invasion of the brain, immune suppression and angiogenesis. This glioblastoma takeover of the brain involves multiple modes of communication, including soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines, direct cell-cell contact, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes and microvesicles) and connecting nanotubes and microtubes. Understanding these multidimensional communications between the tumour and the cells in its environs could open new avenues for therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985475
"""Glioblastoma revisited: from neuronal-like invasion to pacemaking.""","""In recent years, two developments have helped us to better understand the fundamental biology of glioblastoma: the description of a striking intratumoral heterogeneity including gene expression-based cell states, and the discovery that neuro-cancer interactions and cancer-intrinsic neurodevelopmental mechanisms are fundamental features of glioblastoma. In this opinion article, we aim to integrate both developments. We explain how two key disease features are characterized by different neural mechanisms related to distinct but plastic cancer cell states: first, the single cell-dominated invasive parts and second, the more solid parts which are dominated by communicating cell networks constantly activated by pacemaker-like glioblastoma cells. The resulting integrative roadmap of molecular and functional heterogeneity contributes to the Cancer Neuroscience of glioblastoma and suggests novel therapeutic strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37586918
"""Glioblastoma and brain connectivity: the need for a paradigm shift.""","""Despite substantial advances in cancer treatment, for patients with glioblastoma prognosis remains bleak. The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reveals intricate functional interplays between glioblastoma and the cellular architecture of the brain, encompassing neurons, glia, and vessels. New findings underscore the role of structural and functional connections within hierarchical networks, known as the connectome. These connections contribute to the location, spread, and recurrence of a glioblastoma, and a patient's overall survival, revealing a complex interplay between the tumour and the CNS. This mounting evidence prompts a paradigm shift, challenging the perception of glioblastomas as mere foreign bodies within the brain. Instead, these tumours are intricately woven into the structural and functional fabric of the brain. This radical change in thinking holds profound implications for the understanding and treatment of glioblastomas, which could unveil new prognostic factors and surgical strategies and optimise radiotherapy. Additionally, a connectivity approach suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation could disrupt pathological neuron-glioma interactions within specific networks.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38876751
"""Glioblastoma quo vadis: Will migration and invasiveness reemerge as therapeutic targets?""","""Purpose: The purpose of the current review is to highlight, on one hand, the fact that the migratory pattern of glioma cells is the major obstacle to combat them with chemotherapy, and on the other one, the new treatment strategies to overcome this obstacle. Methods: This review surveys several membrane and extracellular molecules involved in glioma cell migration, invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis. Results: This review focuses on signaling pathways implicated in the positive regulation of glioblastoma cell migration, including glutamate and ion channel networks, microtubes and membrane-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) containing microRNAs. Glioma cells release glutamate to the extracellular matrix, inducing neuronal cell death, which may facilitate glioma growth and invasion. Glioma cell migration and invasion are further facilitated through ion channels and transporters that modify cellular volume. Microtubes and EV promote connections and communication among glioma cells and with the microenvironment and are associated with progression and resistance to therapy. Potential therapies linked to these pathways for glioblastoma are being developed. Conclusion: Our view is evolving from an intracellular view of the complex intracellular signaling pathways to one of orchestral machinery, including connections between heterogeneous tumoral and nontumoral cells and with the microenvironment through channels, microtubes, and extracellular miRNA, generating different signals at different times. All of these elements give rise to a new perspective for the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30032756
"""Individual glioblastoma cells harbor both proliferative and invasive capabilities during tumor progression.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are characterized by aggressive and infiltrative growth, and by striking heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether tumor cell proliferation and invasion are interrelated, or rather distinct features of different cell populations. Methods: Tumor cell invasion and proliferation were longitudinally determined in real-time using 3D in vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy over weeks. Glioblastoma cells expressed fluorescent markers that permitted the identification of their mitotic history or their cycling versus non-cycling cell state. Results: Live reporter systems were established that allowed us to dynamically determine the invasive behavior, and previous or actual proliferation of distinct glioblastoma cells, in different tumor regions and disease stages over time. Particularly invasive tumor cells that migrated far away from the main tumor mass, when followed over weeks, had a history of marked proliferation and maintained their proliferative capacity during brain colonization. Infiltrating cells showed fewer connections to the multicellular tumor cell network, a typical feature of gliomas. Once tumor cells colonized a new brain region, their phenotype progressively transitioned into tumor microtube-rich, interconnected, slower-cycling glioblastoma cells. Analysis of resected human glioblastomas confirmed a higher proliferative potential of tumor cells from the invasion zone. Conclusions: The detection of glioblastoma cells that harbor both particularly high proliferative and invasive capabilities during brain tumor progression provides valuable insights into the interrelatedness of proliferation and migration-2 central traits of malignancy in glioma. This contributes to our understanding of how the brain is efficiently colonized in this disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335907
"""Modeling glioblastoma invasion using human brain organoids and single-cell transcriptomics.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) consists of devastating neoplasms with high invasive capacity, which have been difficult to study in vitro in a human-derived model system. Therapeutic progress is also limited by cellular heterogeneity within and between tumors, among other factors such as therapy resistance. To address these challenges, we present an experimental model using human cerebral organoids as a scaffold for patient-derived GBM cell invasion. Methods: This study combined tissue clearing and confocal microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing of GBM cells before and after co-culture with organoid cells. Results: We show that tumor cells within organoids extend a network of long microtubes, recapitulating the in vivo behavior of GBM. Transcriptional changes implicated in the invasion process are coherent across patient samples, indicating that GBM cells reactively upregulate genes required for their dispersion. Potential interactions between GBM and organoid cells identified by an in silico receptor-ligand pairing screen suggest functional therapeutic targets. Conclusions: Taken together, our model has proven useful for studying GBM invasion and transcriptional heterogeneity in vitro, with applications for both pharmacological screens and patient-specific treatment selection on a time scale amenable to clinical practice.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32297954
"""Elimination of Radiation-Induced Senescence in the Brain Tumor Microenvironment Attenuates Glioblastoma Recurrence.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are routinely treated with ionizing radiation (IR) but inevitably recur and develop therapy resistance. During treatment, the tissue surrounding tumors is also irradiated. IR potently induces senescence, and senescent stromal cells can promote the growth of neighboring tumor cells by secreting factors that create a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we carried out transcriptomic and tumorigenicity analyses in irradiated mouse brains to elucidate how radiotherapy-induced senescence of non-neoplastic brain cells promotes tumor growth. Following cranial irradiation, widespread senescence in the brain occurred, with the astrocytic population being particularly susceptible. Irradiated brains showed an altered transcriptomic profile characterized by upregulation of CDKN1A (p21), a key enforcer of senescence, and several SASP factors, including HGF, the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Met. Preirradiation of mouse brains increased Met-driven growth and invasiveness of orthotopically implanted glioma cells. Importantly, irradiated p21-/- mouse brains did not exhibit senescence and consequently failed to promote tumor growth. Senescent astrocytes secreted HGF to activate Met in glioma cells and to promote their migration and invasion in vitro, which could be blocked by HGF-neutralizing antibodies or the Met inhibitor crizotinib. Crizotinib also slowed the growth of glioma cells implanted in preirradiated brains. Treatment with the senolytic drug ABT-263 (navitoclax) selectively killed senescent astrocytes in vivo, significantly attenuating growth of glioma cells implanted in preirradiated brains. These results indicate that SASP factors in the irradiated tumor microenvironment drive GBM growth via RTK activation, underscoring the potential utility of adjuvant senolytic therapy for preventing GBM recurrence after radiotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers mechanisms by which radiotherapy can promote GBM recurrence by inducing senescence in non-neoplastic brain cells, suggesting that senolytic therapy can blunt recurrent GBM growth and aggressiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34580063
"""Phenocopying Glioblastoma: A Review.""","""The main reason why therapeutic schemes fail in Glioblastoma lies on its own peculiarities as a cancer and on our failure to fully decipher them. Fast tumor evolution, invasiveness and incomplete surgical resection contribute to disease recurrence, therapy resistance and high mortality. More faithful models must be developed to address Glioblastoma biology and better clinical guidance. Research studies are discussed in this review that: i) improve understanding and assessment of the growth mechanisms of Glioblastoma and ii) develop preclinical models (in vitro-in vivo-in silico) that mimic patient's tumor (phenocopying) in order to provide better prediction of response to therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34506292
"""Kisspeptin Promotes Glioblastoma Cell Invasiveness Via the Gq-PLC-PKC Pathway.""","""Background/aim: Kisspeptin produced from the KISS1 gene is secreted from the living cells, binds to endogenous receptor KISS1R (also called G protein-coupled receptor 54, GPR54), and has various functions in normal physiological conditions. Although an anti-metastatic role of kisspeptin in cancer is well known in several cancer types, its role in brain tumors is not yet understood. Herein, we investigated a the role of kisspeptin in glioblastoma cells. Materials and methods: Glioblastoma cells were treated with kisspeptin and subjected to proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. KISS1R dependency was tested by KISS1R silencing with KISS1R siRNAs. Results: Kisspeptin inhibited migratory and invasive abilities of U87-MG, U-251-MG and U373-MG glioblastoma cells with no effect on cell viability. KISS1R gene silencing with KISS1R siRNAs blocked kisspeptin-induced glioblastoma cell invasiveness. Moreover, chemical inhibitors against Gq, PLC or PKC blocked kisspeptin-induced glioblastoma cell invasiveness. Conclusion: Kisspeptin induces glioblastoma cell invasiveness via the KISS1R-Gq-PLC-PKC signaling pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31892569
"""IGFBP5 is an ROR1 ligand promoting glioblastoma invasion via ROR1/HER2-CREB signaling axis.""","""Diffuse infiltration is the main reason for therapeutic resistance and recurrence in glioblastoma (GBM). However, potential targeted therapies for GBM stem-like cell (GSC) which is responsible for GBM invasion are limited. Herein, we report Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP5) is a ligand for Receptor tyrosine kinase like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1), as a promising target for GSC invasion. Using a GSC-derived brain tumor model, GSCs were characterized into invasive or non-invasive subtypes, and RNA sequencing analysis revealed that IGFBP5 was differentially expressed between these two subtypes. GSC invasion capacity was inhibited by IGFBP5 knockdown and enhanced by IGFBP5 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo, particularly in a patient-derived xenograft model. IGFBP5 binds to ROR1 and facilitates ROR1/HER2 heterodimer formation, followed by inducing CREB-mediated ETV5 and FBXW9 expression, thereby promoting GSC invasion and tumorigenesis. Importantly, using a tumor-specific targeting and penetrating nanocapsule-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9-based IGFBP5 gene editing significantly suppressed GSC invasion and downstream gene expression, and prolonged the survival of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, our data reveal that IGFBP5-ROR1/HER2-CREB signaling axis as a potential GBM therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36949068
"""Cancer stem cell contribution to glioblastoma invasiveness.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal brain tumor in adults. Its invasive nature currently represents the most challenging hurdle to surgical resection. The mechanism adopted by GBM cells to carry out their invasive strategy is an intricate program that recalls what takes place in embryonic cells during development and in carcinoma cells during metastasis formation, the so-called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. GBM cells undergo a series of molecular and conformational changes shifting the tumor toward mesenchymal traits, including extracellular matrix remodeling, cytoskeletal re-patterning, and stem-like trait acquisition. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the whole infiltrative process represents the first step toward successful treatment of this pathology. Here, we review recent findings demonstrating the invasive nature of GBM cancer stem cells, together with novel candidate molecules associated with both cancer stem cell biology and GBM invasion, like doublecortin and microRNAs. These findings may affect the design of effective therapies currently not considered for GBM invasive progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23510696
"""RNA-Binding Motif Protein RBM47 Promotes Invasiveness of Glioblastoma Through Activation of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Program.""","""Background: RNA-binding motif proteins (RBMs) have been widely implicated in the tumorigenesis of multiple human cancers but rarely investigated in glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: The expression level of RBM47 and its correlation with prognosis of GBM were examined using bioinformatics, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and Western blot analysis. The colony formation assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay were used to determine the biological role of RBM47 in GBM. To measure invasiveness we used the wound healing assay and transwell assay. The regulatory relationship between RBM47 and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was examined by Western blot analysis and bioinformatic analysis. Results: Through integrative analysis of clinical proteomic and genomic tumor datasets, we found that RBM47 is significantly upregulated in GBM mesenchymal subtype, and its high expression is correlated with poor prognosis. In in vitro biological experiments, we observed a significant inhibitory effect of RBM47 knockdown on colony formation and cell growth using GBM cell lines. Conversely, overexpression of RBM47 restored and accelerated these processes. Moreover, in vitro, wound healing assays demonstrated the role of RBM46 in promoting and cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, RBM47 enhances invasive capacity through the activation of the EMT program. In RBM47-knockdown cells, the expression levels of Vimentin and CD44 were suppressed, and the level of E-cadherin was increased. Conclusions: Taken together our results demonstrate the tumor promoting characteristics of RBM46 and suggest that it could be used both as a therapeutic target and prognostically.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38156907
"""Presenilin1 inhibits glioblastoma cell invasiveness via promoting Sortilin cleavage.""","""Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma are the most common and devastating diseases in the neurology and neurosurgery departments, respectively. Our previous research reports that the AD-related protein Presenilin1 represses cell proliferation by inhibiting the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in glioblastoma. However, the function of Presenilin1 and the underlying mechanism need to be further investigated. Methods: The correlations of two genes were conducted on the R2 microarray platform and CGGA. Wound healing, Transwell assays and glioblastoma transplantation were performed to detect invasion ability. Phalloidin staining was employed to show cell morphology. Proximity ligation assays and protein docking assays were employed to detect two protein locations. We also employed western blotting to detect protein expression. Results: We found that Presenilin1 clearly repressed the migration, invasion and mesenchymal transition of glioblastoma cells. Intriguingly, we observed that the expression of Presenilin1 was positively correlated with Sortilin, which is identified as a pro-invasion molecule in glioma. Furthermore, Presenilin1 interacted with Sortilin at the transmembrane domain and repressed Sortilin expression by cleaving it in glioblastoma cells. First, we found that Sortilin introduced the function of Presenilin1 in phosphorylating Î²-catenin and repressing invasion in glioblastoma cells. Last, Presenilin1 stimulation sharply suppressed the invasion and mesenchymal transition of glioblastoma in mouse subcutaneous and intracranial transplantation models. Conclusions: Our study reveals that Sortilin mediates the regulation of Î²-catenin by Presenilin1 and transduces the anti-invasive function of Presenilin1, which may provide novel therapeutic targets for glioblastoma treatment.

"""Models for evaluating glioblastoma invasion along white matter tracts.""","""White matter tracts (WMs) are one of the main invasion paths of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The lack of ideal research models hinders our understanding of the details and mechanisms of GBM invasion along WMs. To date, many potential in vitro models have been reported; nerve fiber culture models and nanomaterial models are biocompatible, and the former have electrically active neurons. Brain slice culture models, organoid models, and microfluidic chip models can simulate the real brain and tumor microenvironment (TME), which contains a variety of cell types. These models are closer to the real in vivo environment and are helpful for further studying not only invasion along WMs by GBM, but also perineural invasion and brain metastasis by solid tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37806896

Recent works discovered the role of new molecular players in GBM invasion, and, most importantly, better models are emerging which better recapitulate GBM invasion. Summary: Invasive properties of glioblastoma make complete surgical resection impossible and highly invasive cells are responsible for tumor recurrence.

"""Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies critical transcription factors of tumor cell invasion induced by hypoxia microenvironment in glioblastoma.""","""Rationale: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignant primary brain cancer with poor survival. Hypoxia is a hallmark of GBM, which promotes tumor cells spreading (invasion) into the healthy brain tissue. Methods: To better elucidate the influence of hypoxia on GBM invasion, we proposed a data-driven modeling framework for predicting cellular hypoxia (CHPF) by integrating single cell transcriptome profiling and hypoxia gene signatures. Results: We characterized the hypoxia status landscape of GBM cells and observed that hypoxic cells were only present in the tumor core. Then, by investigating the cell-cell communication between immune cells and tumor cells, we discovered significant interaction between macrophages and tumor cells in hypoxic microenvironment. Notably, we dissected the functional heterogeneity of tumor cells and identified a hypoxic subpopulation that had highly invasive potential. By constructing cell status specific gene regulatory networks, we further identified 14 critical regulators of tumor invasion induced by hypoxic microenvironment. Finally, we confirmed that knocking down two critical regulators CEBPD and FOSL1 could reduce the invasive ability of GBM under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, we revealed the therapeutic effect of Axitinib and Entinostat through the mice model. Conclusion: Our work revealed the critical regulators in hypoxic subpopulation with high invasive potential in GBM, which may have practical implications for clinical targeted-hypoxia cancer drug therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37441593
"""New insights into the role of thrombospondin-1 in glioblastoma development.""","""Glioblastoma (GB), the most malignant subtype of diffuse glioma, is highly aggressive, invasive and vascularized. Its median survival is still short even with maximum standard care. There is a need to identify potential new molecules and mechanisms, that are involved in the interactions of GB cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME), for therapeutic intervention. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a multi-faceted matricellular protein which plays a significant role in development, physiology and pathology including cancer. Recent studies have pinpoint an important role of TSP1 in GB development which will be summarized and discussed herein. We will discuss studies, mainly from preclinical research, which should lead to a deeper understanding of TSP1's role in GB development. We will also discuss some issues with regard to the use of this knowledge for the clinic.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37690904

Recent research has revealed novel insights into the outstanding heterogeneity of this type of brain cancer. However, all GBM subtypes share the hallmark feature of aggressive invasion into the surrounding tissue. Invasive glioblastoma cells escape surgery and focal therapies and thus represent a major obstacle for curative therapy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of glioma invasion mechanisms with respect to tumor-cell-intrinsic properties as well as cues provided by the microenvironment. We discuss genetic programs that may influence the dissemination and plasticity of GBM cells as well as their different invasion patterns. We also review how tumor cells shape their microenvironment and how, vice versa, components of the extracellular matrix and factors from non-neoplastic cells influence tumor cell motility. We further discuss different research platforms for modeling invasion. Finally, we highlight the importance of accounting for the complex interplay between tumor cell invasion and treatment resistance in glioblastoma when considering new therapeutic approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32178267
"""The role of proteolysis in tumor invasiveness in glioblastoma and metastatic brain tumors.""","""Local invasive infiltration and growth are key features in glioblastoma, which are accompanied by remodeling of the vasculature and the destruction of the surrounding normal brain tissues. The local and regional spread of glioblastoma is often associated with poor prognosis. The invasive character of glioblastoma appears to depend partly on the proteolytic destruction of the extracellular matrix components. In this article, we review the role of proteolytic enzymes, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix-metalloproteases, for diffuse infiltrative growth of glioblastoma. An understanding of the mechanisms of increased expression of these molecules in glioblastoma might provide an insight into the regulatory pathway of cellular invasion and for a new therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12553067
"""An Experimenter's Guide to Glioblastoma Invasion Pathways.""","""Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor that is characterized by its unparalleled invasiveness. Invasive glioblastoma cells not only escape surgery and focal therapies but also are more resistant to current radio- and chemo-therapeutic approaches. Thus, any curative therapy for this deadly disease likely should include treatment strategies that interfere with glioblastoma invasiveness. Understanding glioblastoma invasion mechanisms is therefore critical. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various glioblastoma invasion models and conclude that robust experimental evidence has been obtained for a pro-invasive role of Ephrin receptors, Rho GTPases, and casein kinase 2 (CK2). Extensive interplay occurs between these proteins, suggesting the existence of a glioblastoma invasion signaling network that comprises several targets for therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30072121
"""Fibrinogen in the glioblastoma microenvironment contributes to the invasiveness of brain tumor-initiating cells.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly aggressive, recurrent, and lethal brain tumors that are maintained via brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). The aggressiveness of BTICs may be dependent on the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules that are highly enriched within the GBM microenvironment. Here, we investigated the expression of ECM molecules in GBM patients by mining the transcriptomic databases and also staining human GBM specimens. RNA levels for fibronectin, brevican, versican, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), and several laminins were high in GBMs compared to normal brain, and this was corroborated by immunohistochemistry. While fibrinogen transcript was at normal level in GBM, its protein immunoreactivity was prominent within GBM tissues. These ECM molecules in tumor specimens were in proximity to, and surrounding BTICs. In culture, fibronectin and pan-laminin induced the adhesion of BTICs onto the plastic substratum. However, fibrinogen increased the size of the BTIC spheres by facilitating the adhesive property, motility, and invasiveness of BTICs. These features of elevated invasiveness were corroborated in resected GBM specimens by the close proximity of fibrinogen with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and-9, which are proteases implicated in metastasis. Moreover, the effect of fibrinogen-induced invasiveness was attenuated in BTICs where MMP-2 and -9 have been inhibited with siRNAs or pharmacological inhibitors. Our results implicate fibrinogen in GBM as a mediator of the invasive properties of BTICs, and as a target for therapy to reduce BTIC tumorigenecity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33694259

Methods: Complementary biological models based on U87 spheroids including conventional 3D invasion assay, organotypic brain slice cultures, chronic cranial window model were implemented to investigate the impact of RT treatments (10 Gy single dose; 5Ã2 Gy or 2Ã5 Gy) combined with Au@DTDTPA(Gd) nanoparticles on tumor progression. The main tumor mass and its infiltrative area were analyzed. This work focused on the invading cancer cells after irradiation and their viability, aggressiveness, and recurrence potential were assessed using mitotic catastrophe quantification, MMP secretion analysis and neurosphere assays, respectively. Results: In vitro clonogenic assays showed that Au@DTDTPA(Gd) nanoparticles exerted a radiosensitizing effect on U87 cells, and in vivo experiments suggested a benefit of the combined treatment 'RT 2Ã5 Gy + Au@DTDTPA(Gd)' compared to RT alone. Invasion assays revealed that invasion distance tended to increase after irradiation alone, while the combined treatments were able to significantly reduce tumor invasion. Monitoring of U87-GFP tumor progression using organotypic cultures or intracerebral grafts confirmed the anti-invasive effect of Au@DTDTPA(Gd) on irradiated spheroids. Most importantly, the combination of Au@DTDTPA(Gd) with irradiation drastically reduced the number, the viability and the aggressiveness of tumor cells able to escape from U87 spheroids. Notably, the combined treatments significantly reduced the proportion of escaped cells with stem-like features that could cause recurrence. Conclusion: Combining Au@DTDTPA(Gd) nanoparticles and X-ray radiotherapy appears as an attractive therapeutic strategy to decrease number, viability and aggressiveness of tumor cells that escape and can invade the surrounding brain parenchyma. Hence, Au@DTDTPA(Gd)-enhanced radiotherapy opens up interesting perspectives for glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36660336
"""Mesenchymal Stem-Like Cells Derived from the Ventricle More Effectively Enhance Invasiveness of Glioblastoma Than Those Derived from the Tumor.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human tumors with a highly infiltrative phenotype. Our previous studies showed that GBM originates in the subventricular zone, and that tumor-derived mesenchymal stem-like cells (tMSLCs) promote the invasiveness of GBM tumorspheres (TSs). Here, we extend these studies in terms of ventricles using several types of GBM patient-derived cells. Materials and methods: The invasiveness of GBM TSs and ventricle spheres (VSs) were quantified via collagen-based 3D invasion assays. Gene expression profiles were obtained from microarray data. A mouse orthotopic xenograft model was used for in vivo experiments. Results: After molecular and functional characterization of ventricle-derived mesenchymal stem-like cells (vMSLCs), we investigated the effects of these cells on the invasiveness of GBM TSs. We found that vMSLC-conditioned media (CM) significantly accelerated the invasiveness of GBM TSs and VSs, compared to the control and even tMSLC-CM. Transcriptome analyses revealed that vMSLC secreted significantly higher levels of several invasiveness-associated cytokines. Moreover, differentially expressed genes between vMSLCs and tMSLCs were enriched for migration, adhesion, and chemotaxis-related gene sets, providing a mechanistic basis for vMSLC-induced invasion of GBM TSs. In vivo experiments using a mouse orthotopic xenograft model confirmed vMSLC-induced increases in the invasiveness of GBM TSs. Conclusion: Although vMSLCs are non-tumorigenic, this study adds to our understanding of how GBM cells acquire infiltrative features by vMSLCs, which are present in the region where GBM genesis originates.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36825341

Key GBM invasion mechanisms included ECM degradation, vascular invasion, EMT, apoptotic regulation, cytoskeletal organization, and RNA sequencing. Vascular mechanisms were most studied. Bevacizumab resistance linked to poorer outcomes. EMT markers like TWIST and ECM degradation via MMPs such as CD147 correlated with decreased survival. Cytoskeletal and RNA studies highlighted the prognostic significance of tumor subtypes and microenvironmental interactions.

Therefore, there is a need to identify new factors that might be targeted to decrease GBSC invasive capabilities as well as radioresistance. Patient-derived GBSC were used in this study to demonstrate a higher expression of the glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A) in invasive GBSC compared to non-invasive cells. In 3D invasion assays performed on primary neurospheres of GBSC, we showed that blocking GPM6A expression by siRNA significantly reduced cell invasion. We also demonstrated a high correlation of GPM6A with the oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPRZ1, which regulates GPM6A expression and cell invasion. The results of our study also show that GPM6A and PTPRZ1 are crucial for GBSC sphere formation. Finally, we demonstrated that targeting GPM6A or PTPRZ1 in GBSC increases the radiosensitivity of GBSC. Our results suggest that blocking GPM6A or PTPRZ1 could represent an interesting approach in the treatment of glioblastoma since it would simultaneously target proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35883571

Recently, we have shown that a mesenchymal-to-proneural mRNA signature of patient derived GSC-enriched (pGSC) cultures associates with in vitro radioresistance and gel invasion. Importantly, this pGSC mRNA signature is prognostic for patients' tumor recurrence pattern and overall survival. Two mesenchymal markers of the mRNA signature encode for IKCa and BKCa Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Therefore, we analyzed here the effect of IKCa- and BKCa-targeting concomitant to (fractionated) irradiation on radioresistance and glioblastoma spreading in pGSC cultures and in pGSC-derived orthotopic xenograft glioma mouse models. To this end, in vitro gel invasion, clonogenic survival, in vitro and in vivo residual DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), tumor growth, and brain invasion were assessed in the dependence on tumor irradiation and K+ channel targeting. As a result, the IKCa- and BKCa-blocker TRAM-34 and paxilline, respectively, increased number of residual DSBs and (numerically) decreased clonogenic survival in some but not in all IKCa- and BKCa-expressing pGSC cultures, respectively. In addition, BKCa- but not IKCa-blockade slowed-down gel invasion in vitro. Moreover, systemic administration of TRAM-34 or paxilline concomitant to fractionated tumor irradiation increased in the xenograft model(s) residual number of DSBs and attenuated glioblastoma brain invasion and (numerically) tumor growth. We conclude, that KCa-blockade concomitant to fractionated radiotherapy might be a promising new strategy in glioblastoma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38938062
"""Exosomal L1CAM Stimulates Glioblastoma Cell Motility, Proliferation, and Invasiveness.""","""Immunoglobulin superfamily protein L1CAM (L1, CD171) normally facilitates neuronal migration, differentiation, and axon guidance during development. Many types of cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM), also abnormally express L1, and this has been associated with poor prognosis due to increased cell proliferation, invasiveness, or metastasis. We showed previously that the soluble L1 ectodomain, which is proteolyzed from the transmembrane form, can stimulate proliferation and motility of GBM cells in vitro by acting through integrins and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Minute L1-decorated exosomal vesicles also are released by GBM cells and potentially could stimulate cell motility, proliferation, and invasiveness, but this needed to be demonstrated. In the present study, we aimed to determine if minute L1-decorated extracellular vesicles (exosomes) were capable of stimulating GBM cell motility, proliferation, and invasiveness. L1-decorated exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media of the human T98G GBM cell line and were evaluated for their effects on the behavior of glioma cell lines and primary tumor cells. L1-decorated exosomes significantly increased cell velocity in the three human glioma cells tested (T98G/shL1, U-118 MG, and primary GBM cells) in a highly quantitative SuperScratch assay compared to L1-reduced exosomes from L1-attenuated T98G/shL1 cells. They also caused a marked increase in cell proliferation as determined by DNA cell cycle analysis and cell counting. In addition, L1-decorated exosomes facilitated initial GBM cell invasion when mixed with non-invasive T98G/shL1 cells in our chick embryo brain tumor model, whereas mixing with L1-reduced exosomes did not. Chemical inhibitors against focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) decreased L1-mediated motility and proliferation to varying degrees. These novel data show that L1-decoratred exosomes stimulate motility, proliferation and invasion to influence GBM cell behavior, which adds to the complexity of how L1 stimulates cancer cells through not only soluble ectodomain but also through exosomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426278

Standard treatment for glioblastoma includes maximal safe surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Despite treatment advances, only 15-20% of glioblastoma patients survive to 5 years, and no therapies have demonstrated a durable survival benefit in recurrent disease. In the last 10 years, significant advances in knowledge of the biology and molecular pathology of the malignancy have opened the way to new treatment options. Clinical management of patients (pseudo-progressions, side effects of therapies, best supportive care, centralization in expertise care centers) has improved. In brain tumors, such as in other solid tumors, we have entered an era of immune-oncology.

Nanotherapeutics, an approach designed to deliver drugs to specific sites, is experiencing rapid growth and gaining immense popularity. Having potential in reaching the hard-to-reach disease sites, this field has the potential to show high efficacy in combatting glioblastoma progression. The presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) is a major factor behind the poor prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Stemness potential, heterogeneity, and self-renewal capacity, are some of the properties that make GSCs invade across the distant regions of the brain. Despite advances in medical technology and MRI-guided maximal surgical resection, not all GSCs residing in the brain can be removed, leading to recurrent disease. The aggressiveness of GBM is often correlated with immune suppression, where the T-cells are unable to infiltrate the cancer initiating GSCs. Standard of care therapies, including surgery and chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy, have failed to tackle all the challenges of the GSCs, making it increasingly important for researchers to develop strategies to tackle their growth and proliferation and reduce the recurrence of GBM.

"""Basal caspase activity promotes migration and invasiveness in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastomas, the most malignant of all brain tumors, are characterized by cellular resistance to apoptosis and a highly invasive growth pattern. These factors contribute to the poor response of glioblastomas to radiochemotherapy and prevent their complete neurosurgical resection. However, the driving force behind the distinct motility of glioma cells is only partly understood. Here, we report that in the absence of cellular stress and proapoptotic stimuli, human glioblastoma cells exhibit a constitutive activation of caspases in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of caspases by various peptide inhibitors decreases the migration of cells in scrape motility assays and the invasiveness of cells in spheroid assays. Similarly, specific small interfering RNA- or antisense-mediated down-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 results in an inhibition of the migratory potential of glioma cells. The constitutive caspase-dependent motility of glioblastoma cells is independent of CD95 activation and it is not mediated by mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase signaling. The basal caspase activity is accompanied by a constant cleavage of the motility-associated gelsolin protein, which may contribute to the caspase-mediated promotion of migration and invasiveness in glioblastoma cells. Our results suggest that the administration of low doses of caspase inhibitors that block glioma cell motility without affecting the execution of apoptotic cell death may be exploited as a novel strategy for the treatment of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18171980

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have not yet proven efficacious for glioblastoma patients, due in part to the low prevalence of tumor-reactive T cells within the tumor microenvironment. The priming of tumor antigen-directed T cells in the cervical lymph nodes is complicated by the shortage of dendritic cells and lack of appropriate lymphatic vessels within the brain parenchyma. However, recent data suggest that naive T cells may also be primed within brain tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures. Here, we review the current understanding of the formation of these structures within the central nervous system, and hypothesize that promotion of tertiary lymphoid structures could enhance priming of tumor antigen-targeted T cells and sensitize glioblastomas to cancer immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34539661

However, uncovering its underlying mechanism for promoting GBM progression is still a challenging work. In this study, we found that serine protease inhibitor family E member 1 (SERPINE1) was a potential downstream gene of GDNF. Further experiments confirmed that SERPINE1 was highly expressed in GBM tissues and cells, and its levels of expression and secretion were enhanced by exogenous GDNF. SERPINE1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of GBM cells promoted by GDNF. Mechanistically, GDNF increased SERPINE1 by promoting the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. In vivo experiments demonstrated that GDNF facilitated GBM growth and the expressions of proteins related to migration and invasion via SERPINE1. Collectively, our findings revealed that GDNF upregulated SERPINE1 via the SMAD2/3-signaling pathway, thereby accelerating GBM cell migration and invasion.

Here, we investigated the role and application value of TPPP3 in gliomas and found that the expression of TPPP3 in glioma was higher than that in normal brain tissue (NBT), and increased with the grade of glioma. Up-regulation of TPPP3 expression in glioblastoma cells confer stronger ability of migration, invasion, proliferation and lower apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of TPPP3 expression in GBM could reduce the migration, invasion, proliferation and induce the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. TPPP3 affected the process of EMT by regulating the expression of Snail 1 protein. In clinical data analysis, we found a positive correlation between TPPP3 and Snail1 protein expression levels in glioblastomas. Low TPPP3 expression leads to better survival expectations in glioblastomas patients.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is the preferred drug for GBM chemotherapy, however, development of TMZ resistance is over 50% cases in GBM patients. To investigate the mechanism of TMZ resistance and invasive characteristics of GBM, analysis of combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq was performed in GBM cells in response to TMZ treatment. We found that the PERK/eIF2Î±/ATF4 signaling was significantly upregulated in the GBM cells with TMZ treatment, while blockage of ATF4 effectively inhibited cell migration and invasion. SPHK1 expression was transcriptionally upregulated by ATF4 in GBM cells in response to TMZ treatment. Blockage of ATF4-SPHK1 signaling attenuated the cellular and molecular events in terms of invasive characteristics and TMZ resistance. In conclusion, GBM cells acquired chemoresistance in response to TMZ treatment via constant ER stress. ATF4 transcriptionally upregulated SPHK1 expression to promote GBM cell aggression and TMZ resistance. The ATF4-SPHK1 signaling in the regulation of the transcription factors of EMT-related genes could be the underlying mechanism contributing to the invasion ability of GBM cells and TMZ resistance.

Deregulation of these molecular machines may lead to striking perturbations in normal cell function. The CHD7 gene is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family and, when mutated, has been shown to be the cause of the CHARGE syndrome, a severe developmental human disorder. Moreover, CHD7 has been described to be essential for neural stem cells and it is also highly expressed or mutated in a number of human cancers. However, its potential role in glioblastoma has not yet been tested. Here, we show that CHD7 is up-regulated in human glioma tissues and we demonstrate that CHD7 knockout (KO) in LN-229 glioblastoma cells suppresses anchorage-independent growth and spheroid invasion in vitro. Additionally, CHD7 KO impairs tumor growth and increases overall survival in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of CHD7 in LN-428 and A172 glioblastoma cell lines increases cell motility and invasiveness in vitro and promotes LN-428 tumor growth in vivo. Finally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that CHD7 modulates a specific transcriptional signature of invasion-related target genes.

"""Glial Cell Adhesion Molecule (GlialCAM) Determines Proliferative versus Invasive Cell States in Glioblastoma.""","""The malignant brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) contains groups of highly invasive cells that drive tumor progression as well as recurrence after surgery and chemotherapy. The molecular mechanisms that enable these GBM cells to exit the primary mass and disperse throughout the brain remain largely unknown. Here we report using human tumor specimens and primary spheroids from male and female patients that glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM), which has normal roles in brain astrocytes and is mutated in the developmental brain disorder megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), is differentially expressed in subpopulations of GBM cells. High levels of GlialCAM promote cell-cell adhesion and a proliferative GBM cell state in the tumor core. In contrast, GBM cells with low levels of GlialCAM display diminished proliferation and enhanced invasion into the surrounding brain parenchyma. RNAi-mediated inhibition of GlialCAM expression leads to activation of proinvasive extracellular matrix adhesion and signaling pathways. Profiling GlialCAM-regulated genes combined with cross-referencing to single-cell transcriptomic datasets validates functional links among GlialCAM, Mlc1, and aquaporin-4 in the invasive cell state. Collectively, these results reveal an important adhesion and signaling axis comprised of GlialCAM and associated proteins including Mlc1 and aquaporin-4 that is critical for control of GBM cell proliferation and invasion status in the brain cancer microenvironment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glioblastoma (GBM) contains heterogeneous populations of cells that coordinately drive proliferation and invasion.

Transsulfuration influences invasion and growth in glioblastoma.""","""A major challenge in treating patients with glioblastoma is the inability to eliminate highly invasive cells with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical resection. As cancer cells face the issue of replicating or invading neighboring tissue, they rewire their metabolism in a concerted effort to support necessary cellular processes and account for altered nutrient abundance. In this issue of the JCI, Garcia et al. compared an innovative 3D hydrogel-based invasion device to regional patient biopsies through a comprehensive multiomics-based approach paired with a CRISPR knockout screen. Their findings elucidate a role for cystathionine Î³-lyase (CTH), an enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, as a means of regulating the cellular response to oxidative stress. CTH-mediated conversion of cystathionine to cysteine was necessary for regulating reactive oxygen species to support invasion. Meanwhile, inhibition of CTH suppressed the invasive glioblastoma phenotype. However, inhibiting CTH resulted in a larger overall tumor mass.

Nanobodies, camelid single-domain antibody fragments, emerge as a promising tool for immunotargeted applications for diagnosing and treating glioblastomas. Performing agnostic bioinformatic analysis from glioblastoma patient datasets, we identified ATP Binding Cassette subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3) as a suitable target for immunotargeted applications. The expression of ABCC3 is associated with poor survival and impaired response to temozolomide. Importantly, high expression of ABCC3 is restricted to glioblastoma, with negligible levels in healthy brain tissue, and further correlates with tumor grade and stemness markers. We identified three immunogenic epitopes of ABCC3 which were used to isolate nanobodies from a glioblastoma-specific phage-display nanobody library. Two nanobodies targeting ABCC3 (NbA42 and NbA213) were further characterized and demonstrated in vivo selective recognition of ABCC3 in glioblastoma xenograft mouse models upon systemic administration.

"""Glioblastoma-Astrocyte Connexin 43 Gap Junctions Promote Tumor Invasion.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), classified as World Health Organization grade IV astrocytoma, is the deadliest adult cancer of the central nervous system. An important contributing factor to poor survival rates in GBM is extensive invasion, which decreases the efficacy of resection and subsequent adjuvant therapies. These treatments could be markedly improved with increased resolution of the genetic and molecular initiators and effectors of invasion. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the principal astrocytic gap junction (GJ) protein. Despite the heterogeneity of GBM, a subpopulation of cells in almost all GBM tumors express Cx43. Functional GJs between GBM cells and astrocytes at the tumor edge are of critical interest for understanding invasion. In this study, we find that both in vitro and in ex vivo slice cultures, GBM is substantially less invasive when placed in a Cx43-deficient astrocyte environment. Furthermore, when Cx43 is deleted in GBM, the invasive phenotype is recovered. These data strongly suggest that there are opposing roles for Cx43 in GBM migration. We find that Cx43 is localized to the tumor edge in our ex vivo model, suggesting that GBM-astrocyte GJ communication at the tumor border is a driving force for invasion. Finally, we find that by a Cx43-dependent mechanism, but likely not direct channel-mediated diffusion, miRNAs associated with cell-matrix adhesion are transferred from GBM to astrocytes and miR-19b promotes invasion, revealing a role for post-transcriptional manipulation of astrocytes in fostering an invasion-permissive peritumoral niche.

"""Glioblastoma niches: from the concept to the phenotypical reality.""","""Recently, the concept of niches as sites of tumor progression, invasion, and angiogenesis in glioblastoma (GB) has been extensively debated. Niches, considered the sites in which glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) reside, have been classified as perivascular, perinecrotic, and invasive. However, from a neuropathological point of view, it is not easy to establish when a tumor structure can be considered a niche. The relevant literature has been reviewed in the light of our recent experience on the subject. As for perinecrotic niches, the occurrence of GSCs around necrosis is interpreted as triggered by hypoxia through HIF-1Î±. Our alternative hypothesis is that, together with progenitors, they are the cell constituents of hyper-proliferative areas of GB, where perinecrotic niches have developed, and they would, therefore, represent the remnants of GSCs/progenitors spared by the developing necrosis. Perivascular structures originate from both transport vessels and exchange vessels, i.e., venules, arterioles, or the undefinable neo-formed small vessels, but only those in which a direct contact between GSCs/progenitors and endothelial cells occurs can be called niches. Both pericytes and microglia/macrophages play a role in niche function: Macrophages of blood origin invade GB only after the appearance of 'mother vessels' with consequent blood-brain barrier disruption. Not all vessel/tumor cell structures can be considered niches, that is, crucial sites of tumor progression, invasion, and angiogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29736738

Methods: We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion capacity in Matrigel. Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide(ASO)-mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression(GTEx) survival analysis. Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments. Results: Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, identified from effect size and p-value, demonstrated 82.7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade(p<0.0001). RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3, previously implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lncRNA expression, while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. Finally, WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD. Conclusion: CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to GBM invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival.

Monoallelic PDXP loss was frequent in four independent human astrocytic tumor cohorts and increased with tumor grade. We found that aberrant PDXP promoter methylation can be a mechanism leading to further chronophin downregulation in glioblastomas, which correlated with shorter glioblastoma patient survival. Moreover, we observed an inverse association between chronophin protein expression and cofilin phosphorylation levels in glioma tissue samples. Chronophin-deficient glioblastoma cells showed elevated cofilin phosphorylation, an increase in polymerized actin, a higher directionality of cell migration, and elevated in vitro invasiveness.

Single clone culture was conducted in ECs and U87MG cell line to screen clones with distinct biological phenotypes. Single cell clones with diverse phenotypes were simultaneously separated from ECs and U87 cell line. PNCs, GCs(H) and U87(H) exhibited longer cellular protrusion than ECs, GCs(L) and U87(L), respectively. Cell strains with longer protrusion exhibited higher invasive ability and lower sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation. Subsequently, TPD52L2 was verified as the functional protein to regulate the cellular heterogeneity by the proteomics analysis. Downregulation of TPD52L2 enhanced cell invasion whereas inhibited cell proliferation rate and sensitivity to chemotherapy in vivo and in vitro, this condition was reversed when TPD52L2 was overexpressed. The invasiveness was facilitated by up-regulating CTNNB1/Î²-catenin and SNAI1/Snail mediated EMT process.

The urgent need to develop more efficacious targeted therapies has led to a better molecular characterization of GBM, revealing an emerging role of semaphorins in GBM progression. Semphorins are a wide group of membrane-bound and secreted proteins, originally identified as axon guidance cues, signaling through their receptors, neuropilins, and plexins. A number of semaphorin signals involved in the control of axonal growth and navigation during development have been found to furthermore participate in crosstalk with different dysfunctional GBM pathways, controlling tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as tumor angiogenesis or immune response.

Highly angiogenic and poorly invasive tumors expressed low levels of Î²8 integrin, whereas highly invasive tumors with limited neovascularization expressed high levels of Î²8 integrin. Manipulating Î²8 integrin protein levels altered the angiogenic and invasive growth properties of GBMs, in part, reflected by a diminished activation of latent TGFÎ²s, which are extracellular matrix protein ligands for Î²8 integrin. Taken together, these results establish a role for Î²8 integrin in differential control of angiogenesis versus tumor cell invasion in GBM. Our findings suggest that inhibiting Î²8 integrin or TGFÎ² signaling may diminish tumor cell invasiveness during malignant progression and following antivascular therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859829
"""Arginine deprivation affects glioblastoma cell adhesion, invasiveness and actin cytoskeleton organization by impairment of beta-actin arginylation.""","""A deficit of exogenous arginine affects growth and viability of numerous cancer cells. Although arginine deprivation-based strategy is currently undergoing clinical trials, molecular mechanisms of tumor cells' response to arginine deprivation are not yet elucidated. We have examined effects of arginine starvation on cell motility, adhesion and invasiveness as well as on actin cytoskeleton organization of human glioblastoma cells. We observed for the first time that arginine, but not lysine, starvation affected cell morphology, significantly inhibited their motility and invasiveness, and impaired adhesion. No effects on glia cells were observed. Also, arginine deprivation in glioblastoma evoked specific changes in actin assembly, decreased Î²-actin filament content, and affected its N-terminal arginylation. We suggest that alterations in organization of Î²-actin resulted from a decrease of its arginylation could be responsible for the observed effects of arginine deprivation on cell invasiveness and migration. Our data indicate that arginine deprivation-based treatment strategies could inhibit, at least transiently, the invasion process of highly malignant brain tumors and may have a potential for combination therapy to extend overall patient survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25362567
"""Classification of IDH wild-type glioblastoma tumorspheres into low- and high-invasion groups based on their transcriptional program.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most lethal tumors, exhibits a highly infiltrative phenotype. Here, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that collectively modulate invasion-related genes in GBM. Methods: The invasiveness of tumorspheres (TSs) were quantified using collagen-based 3D invasion assays. TF activities were quantified by enrichment analysis using GBM transcriptome, and confirmed by cell-magnified analysis of proteome imaging. Invasion-associated TFs were knocked down using siRNA or shRNA, and TSs were orthotopically implanted into mice. Results: After classifying 23 patient-derived GBM TSs into low- and high-invasion groups, we identified active TFs in each group-PCBP1 for low invasion, and STAT3 and SRF for high invasion. Knockdown of these TFs reversed the phenotype and invasion-associated-marker expression of GBM TSs. Notably, MRI revealed consistent patterns of invasiveness between TSs and the originating tumors, with an association between high invasiveness and poor prognosis. Compared to controls, mice implanted with STAT3- or SRF-downregulated GBM TSs showed reduced normal tissue infiltration and tumor growth, and prolonged survival, indicating a therapeutic response. Conclusions: Our integrative transcriptome analysis revealed three invasion-associated TFs in GBM. Based on the relationship among the transcriptional program, invasive phenotype, and prognosis, we suggest these TFs as potential targets for GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37558923
"""Mechanisms regulating glioma invasion.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive, deadliest, and most common brain malignancy in adults. Despite the advances made in surgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median survival for GBM patients has remained at a mere 14 months. GBM poses several unique challenges to currently available treatments for the disease. For example, GBM cells have the propensity to aggressively infiltrate/invade into the normal brain tissues and along the vascular tracks, which prevents complete resection of all malignant cells and limits the effect of localized radiotherapy while sparing normal tissue. Although anti-angiogenic treatment exerts anti-edematic effect in GBM, unfortunately, tumors progress with acquired increased invasiveness. Therefore, it is an important task to gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic and post-treatment invasive phenotypes of GBM in hopes that the gained knowledge would lead to novel GBM treatments that are more effective and less toxic. This review will give an overview of some of the signaling pathways that have been shown to positively and negatively regulate GBM invasion, including, the PI3K/Akt, Wnt, sonic hedgehog-GLI1, and microRNAs. The review will also discuss several approaches to cancer therapies potentially altering GBM invasiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25796440

In this study, we profiled GBM invasion through integrative analysis of histological and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 10 patients. Methods: Human histology samples, patient-derived xenograft mouse histology samples, and scRNA-seq data were collected from 10 GBM patients. Tumor invasion was characterized and quantified at the phenotypic level using hematoxylin and eosin and Ki-67 histology stains. Crystallin alpha B (CRYAB) and CD44 were identified as regulators of tumor invasion from scRNA-seq transcriptomic data and validated in vitro, in vivo, and in a mouse GBM resection model. Results: At the cellular level, we found that invasive GBM are less dense and proliferative than their non-invasive counterparts. At the molecular level, we identified unique transcriptomic features that significantly contribute to GBM invasion. Specifically, we found that CRYAB significantly contributes to postoperative recurrence and is highly co-expressed with CD44 in invasive GBM samples. Conclusions: Collectively, our analysis identifies differentially expressed features between invasive and nodular GBM, and describes a novel relationship between CRYAB and CD44 that contributes to tumor invasiveness, establishing a cellular and molecular landscape of GBM invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35901838
"""Invasion as target for therapy of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The survival of cancer patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme is limited to just a few months even after treatment with the most advanced techniques. The indefinable borders of glioblastoma cell infiltration into the surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete surgical removal. In addition, genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications and microenvironmental heterogeneity cause resistance to radio- and chemotherapy altogether resulting in a hardly to overcome therapeutic scenario. Therefore, the development of efficient therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors requires a better knowledge of genetic and proteomic alterations as well as the infiltrative behavior of glioblastoma cells and how this can be targeted. Among many cell surface receptors, members of the integrin family are known to regulate glioblastoma cell invasion in concert with extracellular matrix degrading proteases. While preclinical and early clinical trials suggested specific integrin targeting as a promising therapeutic approach, clinical trials failed to deliver improved cure rates up to now. Little is known about glioblastoma cell motility, but switches in invasion modes and adaption to specific microenvironmental cues as a consequence of treatment may maintain tumor cell resistance to therapy. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of integrin and protease function for glioblastoma cell invasion in the context of radiochemotherapy is a pressing issue and may be beneficial for the design of efficient therapeutic approaches. This review article summarizes the latest findings on integrins and extracellular matrix in glioblastoma and adds some perspective thoughts on how this knowledge might be exploited for optimized multimodal therapy approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23891970
"""Signaling Determinants of Glioma Cell Invasion.""","""Tumor cell invasiveness is a critical challenge in the clinical management of glioma patients. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that current therapeutic modalities, including anti-angiogenic therapy and radiotherapy, can enhance glioma invasiveness. Glioma cell invasion is stimulated by both autocrine and paracrine factors that act on a large array of cell surface-bound receptors. Key signaling elements that mediate receptor-initiated signaling in the regulation of glioblastoma invasion are Rho family GTPases, including Rac, RhoA and Cdc42. These GTPases regulate cell morphology and actin dynamics and stimulate cell squeezing through the narrow extracellular spaces that are typical of the brain parenchyma. Transient attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix is also necessary for glioblastoma cell invasion. Interactions with extracellular matrix components are mediated by integrins that initiate diverse intracellular signalling pathways. Key signaling elements stimulated by integrins include PI3K, Akt, mTOR and MAP kinases. In order to detach from the tumor mass, glioma cells secrete proteolytic enzymes that cleave cell surface adhesion molecules, including CD44 and L1. Key proteases produced by glioma cells include uPA, ADAMs and MMPs. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control glioma cell invasion has led to the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in this devastating disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32034712

We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented with an isolated left oculomotor nerve palsy. He was found to have a left temporal GBM extended to the frontal lobe. Diagnostics and intraoperative and pathological findings clearly demonstrated a massive infiltration of the cisternal portion of the left oculomotor nerve.

PTEN is generally altered in invasive cancers such as glioblastomas, but its function in collective cell migration and invasion is not fully characterised. Herein, we report that the loss of PTEN increases cell speed during collective migration of non-tumourous cells both in vitro and in vivo. We further show that loss of PTEN promotes LKB1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of the major metabolic regulator AMPK. In turn AMPK increases VASP phosphorylation, reduces VASP localisation at cell-cell junctions and decreases the interjunctional transverse actin arcs at the leading front, provoking a weakening of cell-cell contacts and increasing migration speed. Targeting AMPK activity not only slows down PTEN-depleted cells, it also limits PTEN-null glioblastoma cell invasion, opening new opportunities to treat glioblastoma lethal invasiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35953476

"""Harnessing the role of aberrant cell signaling pathways in glioblastoma multiforme: a prospect towards the targeted therapy.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), designated as grade IV by the World Health Organization, is the most aggressive and challenging brain tumor within the central nervous system. Around 80% of GBM patients have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 12-15 months. Approximately 90% of GBM cases originate from normal glial cells via oncogenic processes, while the remainder arise from low-grade tumors. GBM is notorious for its heterogeneity, high recurrence rates, invasiveness, and aggressive behavior. Its malignancy is driven by increased invasive migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, and reduced apoptosis. Throughout various stages of central nervous system (CNS) development, pivotal signaling pathways, including Wnt/Î²-catenin, Sonic hedgehog signaling (Shh), PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK/ERK, STAT3, NF-ÐB, TGF-Î², and Notch signaling, orchestrate the growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural progenitor cells in the brain. Numerous upstream and downstream regulators within these signaling pathways have been identified as significant contributors to the development of human malignancies. Disruptions or aberrant activations in these pathways are linked to gliomagenesis, enhancing the invasiveness, progression, and aggressiveness of GBM, along with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs). Traditional GBM treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ). However, most patients experience tumor recurrence, leading to low survival rates. This review provides an overview of the major cell signaling pathways involved in gliomagenesis. Furthermore, we explore the signaling pathways leading to therapy resistance and target key molecules within these signaling pathways, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39424705
"""Knockdown of RAD18 inhibits glioblastoma development.""","""This study aimed at investigating the role of RAD18 in the regulation of glioblastoma development as well as the underlying mechanisms. The human glioblastoma U251 and U87MG cells were transfected with siRNAs specifically targeting RAD18, and the effects of knockdown of RAD18 on the viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of U251 and U87MG cells were investigated. Transcriptome sequencing of the siRNA-RAD18-tranfected and siRNA-NC-transfected U251 cells was performed, followed by bioinformatic analyses for sequencing data. The results showed that knockdown of RAD18 significantly inhibited cell viability, promoted apoptosis, and suppressed migration and invasion of U251 and U87MG cells. Bioinformatic analyses of sequencing data identified 1,051 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (369 up- and 682 downregulated genes) in the siRNA-RAD18-transfected U251 cells compared with siRNA-NC-transfected U251 cells. Eleven DEGs, including nerve growth factor (NGF), colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRA), and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), were identified as the hub nodes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Moreover, the aforementioned 11 hub genes were significantly enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and GO functions associated with the extracellular region. Notably, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that the expression levels of NGF, CSF2, HMOX1, and MMP1 were significantly downregulated, while that of PDGFRA was markedly upregulated in the siRNA-RAD18-transfected U251 cells than in the siRNA-NC cells.

We analysed thymosin beta 4 staining on tissue microarrays and performed interrogations of the REMBRANDT and the Cancer Genome Atlas databases. We investigated thymosin beta 4 expression in seven established glioma cell lines and seven glioma-initiating cell lines and induced or silenced thymosin beta 4 expression by lentiviral transduction in LNT-229, U87MG and GS-2 cells to study the effects of altered thymosin beta 4 expression on gene expression, growth, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, self-renewal and differentiation capacity in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Thymosin beta 4 expression increased with grade of malignancy in gliomas. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in LNT-229 and U87MG glioma cells inhibited migration and invasion, promoted starvation-induced cell death in vitro and enhanced survival of glioma-bearing mice. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in GS-2 cells inhibited self-renewal and promoted differentiation in vitro and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo.

This invasive phenotype, like other cellular processes, may be controlled in part by microRNAs - a class of small non-coding RNAs that act by altering the expression of targeted messenger RNAs. In this report, we demonstrate a straightforward method for creating invasive subpopulations of glioblastoma cells (IM3 cells). To understand the correlation between the expression of miRNAs and the invasion, we fully profiled 1263 miRNAs on six different cell lines and two miRNAs, miR-143 and miR-145, were selected for validation of their biological properties contributing to invasion. Further, we investigated an ensemble effect of both miR-143 and miR-145 in promoting invasion. Methods: By repeated serial invasion through MatrigelÂ®-coated membranes, we isolated highly invasive subpopulations of glioma cell lines. Phenotypic characterization of these cells included in vitro assays for proliferation, attachment, and invasion. Micro-RNA expression was compared using miRCURY arrays (Exiqon). In situ hybridization allowed visualization of the regional expression of miR-143 and miR-145 in tumor samples, and antisense probes were used investigate in vitro phenotypic changes seen with knockdown in their expression. Results: The phenotype we created in these selected cells proved stable over multiple passages, and their microRNA expression profiles were measurably different. We found that two specific microRNAs expressed from the same genetic locus, miR-143 and miR-145, were over-expressed in our invasive subpopulations. Further, we also found that combinatorial treatment of these cells with both antisense-miRNAs (antimiR-143 and -145) will abrogated their invasion without decreasing cell attachment or proliferation.

Extracellular guidance molecule netrin-1 promotes the invasiveness and survival of various cancer cell types. We have previously found that netrin-1 activates Notch signaling, and Notch signaling associates with cell stemness. Therefore, we have here investigated the effects of netrin-1 on glioblastoma pathogenesis and glioblastoma cell stemness. Methods: Glioma tissue microarrays were stained with immunohistochemistry and the results were used to evaluate the association between netrin-1 and survival of glioma patients. The localization of netrin-1 was analyzed utilizing fresh frozen glioblastoma tissues. The glioma cell invasion was investigated using ex vivo glioma tissue cultures and newly established primary cell cultures in 3D in vitro invasion assays. Intracranial mouse xenograft models were utilized to investigate the effects of netrin-1 on glioblastoma growth and invasion in vivo. Results: Netrin-1 expression associated with poor patient prognosis in grade II-III gliomas. In addition, its expression correlated with the stem-like cell marker nestin. Netrin-1 overexpression in cultured cells led to increased formation of stem-like cell spheroids. In glioblastoma tumor biopsies netrin-1 localized to hypoxic tumor areas known to be rich in the stem-like cells. In xenograft mouse models netrin-1 expression altered the phenotype of non-invasive glioblastoma cells into diffusively invading and increased the expression of glioma stem-like cell markers. Furthermore, a distinct invasion pattern where netrin-1 positive cells were following the invasive stem-like cells was detected both in mouse models and ex vivo human glioblastoma tissue cultures. Inhibition of netrin-1 signaling targeted especially the stem-like cells and inhibited their infiltrative growth. Conclusions: Our findings describe netrin-1 as an important regulator of glioblastoma cell stemness and motility.

Furthermore, CTR-GNPs displayed excellent photocatalytic activity as shown by the photo-degradation of methylene blue and rhodamine B. Cell migration and invasion assays with human glioblastoma cells were performed to investigate the anti-invasive effect of CTR-GNPs on U87 cells that were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The results show that CTR-GNPs can significantly inhibit both basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced migration and invasion ability. Importantly, treatment with CTR-GNPs significantly decreased the levels of metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9 and phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and protein but not PLD2, which is involved in the modulation of migration and the invasion of glioblastoma cells. These results present a novel mechanism showing that CTR-GNPs can attenuate the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells induced by PMA through transcriptional and translational regulation of MMP-2/-9 and PLD1.

"""Role of microRNAs in mechanisms of glioblastoma resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.""","""Low-grade gliomas and multiform glioblastoma are characterized by highly pronounced anaplasia, malignization, proliferation, and invasiveness; moreover, they are highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. The very low efficiency of traditional approaches in the treatment of patients with glioblastomas is due to the intensive invasive growth of the tumor resulting in deep infiltration of adjacent normal perivascular and nervous tissue and formation of areas of perineural infiltration differently remote from the tumor epicenter. MicroRNAs are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene activities, and their expression is markedly increased in tumors, in particular in gliomas. MicroRNAs have been shown to promote the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of tumor stem and non-stem cells. However, a population of microRNA possessing antitumor effects is also detected in gliomas. As a rule, the expression of antitumor microRNAs is suppressed in tumors. In this review, we consider microRNAs, their influence on radio- and chemoresistance of gliomas, and prospects for their use as specific agents in targeted therapy of gliomas. The pool of these microRNAs has distinct therapeutic value, because on use in combined therapy it can decrease the resistance of glioma tumor stem cells to existing pharmaceuticals and improve the efficiency of radio- and chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23590435

Methods: Binomial GLMnet classifiers of tumor type were built, in fifty iterations of 80% discovery sets, using CSF methylomes obtained from 57 BM, GBM, CNSL, and non-neoplastic control patients. Publicly-available tissue methylation profiles (N = 197) on these entities and normal brain parenchyma were used for validation and model optimization. Results: Models reliably distinguished between BM (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.0), GBM (AUROC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.63-1.0), and CNSL (AUROC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.66-1.0) in independent 20% validation sets. For validation, CSF-based methylome signatures reliably distinguished between tumor types within external tissue samples and tumors from non-neoplastic controls in CSF and tissue. CSF methylome signals were observed to align closely with tissue signatures for each entity. An additional set of optimized CSF-based models, built using tumor-specific features present in tissue data, showed enhanced classification accuracy. Conclusions: CSF methylomes are reliable for liquid biopsy-based classification of the major three malignant brain tumor types. We discuss how liquid biopsies may impact brain cancer management in the future by avoiding surgical risks, classifying unbiopsiable tumors, and guiding surgical planning when resection is indicated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455236
"""Role of micro-RNA (miRNA) in pathogenesis of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a very lethal form of human brain cancer, which is characterized by rapid diffuse, infiltrative growth and high level of cellular heterogeneity. Such cancer patients usually survive for one year under treatment. Recently, the role of small non-coding RNA known as microRNAs (miRNA), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, as miRNAs play a critical role in the tumor-forming processes. The change in expression levels of several miRNAs has been found in GBM patients within last 10 years. It is evident now that impairment of miRNA regulation is one of the key mechanisms in GBM pathogenesis. The miRNA deregulation is involved in many processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, invasion, glioma stem cell behavior, and angiogenesis. GBM is also known as Grade IV astrocytoma, a rare disease with an incidence of 2-3 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and North America, and 50% with GBM die within 1 year, while 90% within 3 years. The treatments of GBM involve chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. The median survival with standard radiation and chemotherapy with Temozolomide is 1 year and 3 months, and median survival without treatment is four and a half months. In this article, symptoms of GBM, treatments, the role of miRNAs, gene expressions, types of miRNAs, neoplasms and glioblastomas, the miRNA biogenesis pathways, deregulation of miRNAs, and care of GBM have been described.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26004603
"""Dexmedetomidine inhibits the migration, invasion, and glycolysis of glioblastoma cells by lactylation of c-myc.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumor with poor prognosis. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) regulates the biological behaviors of tumor cells to accelerate or decelerate cancer progression. Objective: We investigated the effects of Dex on the migration, invasion, and glycolysis in GBM. Methods: The concentration of Dex was determined using the cell counting kit-8 assay. The impacts of Dex on biological behaviors of GBM cells were assessed using Transwell assay, XF96 extracellular flux analysis, and western blot. The expression of c-Myc was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The lactylation or stability of c-Myc was measured by western blot after immunoprecipitation or cycloheximide treatment. Results: We found that Dex (200 nM) inhibited GBM cell viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis. C-Myc was highly expressed in GBM cells and was decreased by Dex treatment. Moreover, Dex suppressed lactylated c-Myc levels via suppressing glycolysis, thereby reducing the protein stability of c-Myc. Sodium lactate treatment abrogated the effects of Dex on the biological behaviors of GBM cells. Conclusion: Dex suppressed the migration, invasion, and glycolysis of GBM cells via inhibiting lactylation of c-Myc and suppressing the c-Myc stability, suggesting that Dex may be a novel therapeutic drug for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39193894
"""Glioblastoma invasion and NMDA receptors: A novel prospect.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma cells create glutamate-rich tumor microenvironment, which initiates activation of ion channels and modulates downstream intracellular signaling. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs; a type of glutamate receptors) have a high affinity for glutamate. The role of NMDAR activation on invasion of glioblastoma cells and the crosstalk with Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) is yet to be explored. Main methods: LN18, U251MG, and patient-derived glioblastoma cells were stimulated with NMDA to activate NMDAR glutamate receptors. The role of NMDAR activation on invasion and migration and its crosstalk with AMPAR were evaluated. Invasion and migration of glioblastoma cells were investigated by in vitro trans-well Matrigel invasion and trans-well migration assays, respectively. Expression of NMDARs and AMPARs at transcript level was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: We determined that NMDA stimulation leads to enhanced invasion in LN18, U251MG, and patient-derived glioblastoma cells, whereas inhibition of NMDAR using MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDAR, significantly decreased the invasive capacity. Concordant with these findings, migration was significantly augmented by NMDAR in both cell lines. Furthermore, NMDA stimulation upregulated the expression of GluN2 and GluA1 subunits at the transcript level. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the previously unexplored role of NMDAR in invasion of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the expression of the GluN2 subunit of NMDAR and the differential overexpression of the GluA1 subunit of AMPAR in both cell lines provide a plausible rationale of crosstalk between these calcium-permeable subunits in the glutamate-rich microenvironment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31564120
"""Cytoplasmic cyclin D1 regulates glioblastoma dissemination.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive brain neoplasia with an elevated recurrence rate after surgical resection. The cyclin D1 (Ccnd1)/Cdk4-retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) axis is frequently altered in GBM, leading to overproliferation by RB1 deletion or by Ccnd1-Cdk4 overactivation. High levels of Ccnd1-Cdk4 also promote GBM cell invasion by mechanisms that are not so well understood. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the in vivo role of cytoplasmic Ccnd1-Cdk4 activity in the dissemination of GBM. We show that Ccnd1 activates the invasion of primary human GBM cells through cytoplasmic RB1-independent mechanisms. By using GBM mouse models, we observed that evaded GBM cells showed cytoplasmic Ccnd1 colocalizing with regulators of cell invasion such as RalA and paxillin. Our genetic data strongly suggest that, in GBM cells, the Ccnd1-Cdk4 complex is acting upstream of those regulators. Accordingly, expression of Ccnd1 induces focal adhesion kinase, RalA and Rac1 activities. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated increased GBM dissemination after expression of membrane-targeted Ccnd1. We conclude that Ccnd1-Cdk4 activity promotes GBM dissemination through cytoplasmic and RB1-independent mechanisms. Therefore, inhibition of Ccnd1-Cdk4 activity may be useful to hinder the dissemination of recurrent GBM. Â© 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Efforts over the past decade have begun to tease out the biochemical details that lead to its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. There is hope that this new understanding will lead to improved treatment strategies for patients with glioblastoma, in the form of targeted, molecularly based therapies that are individualized to specific changes in individual tumors. However, these new therapies have the potential to fundamentally alter the biologic behavior of glioblastoma and, as a result, its imaging appearance. Knowledge about common genetic alterations and the resultant cellular and tissue changes (ie, induced angiogenesis and abnormal cell survival, proliferation, and invasion) in glioblastomas is important as a basis for understanding imaging findings before treatment.

"""Glycation Leads to Increased Invasion of Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and invasive brain tumor with a poor prognosis despite extensive treatment. The switch to aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, in cancer cells leads to an increased production of methylglyoxal (MGO), a potent glycation agent with pro-tumorigenic characteristics. MGO non-enzymatically reacts with proteins, DNA, and lipids, leading to alterations in the signaling pathways, genomic instability, and cellular dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the impact of MGO on the LN229 and U251 (WHO grade IV, GBM) cell lines and the U343 (WHO grade III) glioma cell line, along with primary human astrocytes (hA). The results showed that increasing concentrations of MGO led to glycation, the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products, and decreasing cell viability in all cell lines. The invasiveness of the GBM cell lines increased under the influence of physiological MGO concentrations (0.3 mmol/L), resulting in a more aggressive phenotype, whereas glycation decreased the invasion potential of hA. In addition, glycation had differential effects on the ECM components that are involved in the invasion progress, upregulating TGFÎ², brevican, and tenascin C in the GBM cell lines LN229 and U251. These findings highlight the importance of further studies on the prevention of glycation through MGO scavengers or glyoxalase 1 activators as a potential therapeutic strategy against glioma and GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37174618
"""Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as the driver of changing carcinoma and glioblastoma microenvironment.""","""Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential molecular and cellular process that is part of normal embryogenesis and wound healing, and also has a ubiquitous role in various types of carcinoma and glioblastoma. EMT is activated and regulated by specific microenvironmental endogenous triggers and a complex network of signalling pathways. These mostly include epigenetic events that affect protein translation-controlling factors and proteases, altogether orchestrated by the switching on and off of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes in cancer cells. The hallmark of cancer-linked EMT is that the process is incomplete, as it is opposed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, which results in a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype that shows notable cell plasticity. This is a characteristic of cancer stem cells (CSCs), and it is of the utmost importance in their niche microenvironment, where it governs CSC migratory and invasive properties, thereby creating metastatic CSCs.

"""EGFR-dependent mechanisms in glioblastoma: towards a better therapeutic strategy.""","""Glioblastoma is a particularly resilient cancer, and while therapies may be able to reach the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier, they then have to deal with a highly invasive tumor that is very resistant to DNA damage. It seems clear that in order to kill aggressive glioma cells more efficiently and with fewer side effects on normal tissue, there must be a shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. Since the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in almost 50% of glioblastomas, it currently represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets. In fact, it has been associated with several distinct steps in tumorigenesis, from tumor initiation to tumor growth and survival, and also with the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. However, inhibitors of the EGFR kinase have produced poor results with this type of cancer in clinical trials, with no clear explanation for the tumor resistance observed. Here we will review what we know about the expression and function of EGFR in cancer and in particular in gliomas. We will also evaluate which are the possible molecular and cellular escape mechanisms.

"""Sphingosine-1-phosphate regulates glioblastoma cell invasiveness through the urokinase plasminogen activator system and CCN1/Cyr61.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressively invasive brain neoplasm with poor patient prognosis. We have previously shown that the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) stimulates in vitro invasiveness of GBM cells and that high expression levels of the enzyme that forms S1P, sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1), correlate with shorter survival time of GBM patients. We also recently showed that S1P induces expression of CCN1 (also known as Cyr61), a matricellular protein known to correlate with poor patient prognosis, in GBM cells. In this study, we further explored the role of CCN1 as well as the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a protein known to stimulate GBM cell invasiveness, in S1P-induced invasion using a spheroid invasion assay. We also investigated the roles of various S1P receptors in stimulating invasiveness through these pathways. S1P induced expression of uPA and its receptor, uPAR, in GBM cells. Whereas S1P(1), S1P(2), and S1P(3) receptors all contribute, at least partially, S1P(1) overexpression led to the most dramatic induction of the uPA system and of spheroid invasion, even in the absence of added S1P. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies directed against uPA or CCN1 significantly decreased both basal and S1P-stimulated GBM cell invasiveness. Inhibition of SphK blocked basal expression of uPA and uPAR, as well as glioma cell invasion; however, overexpression of SphK did not augment S1P receptor-mediated enhancement of uPA activity or invasion. Thus, SphK is necessary for basal activity of the uPA system and glioma cell invasion, whereas S1P receptor signaling enhances invasion, partially through uPA and CCN1.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19147534
"""Secretome signature of invasive glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The incurability of malignant glioblastomas is mainly attributed to their highly invasive nature coupled with resistance to chemo- and radiation therapy. Because invasiveness is partially dictated by the proteins these tumors secrete we used SILAC to characterize the secretomes of four glioblastoma cell lines (LN18, T98, U118 and U87). Although U87 and U118 cells both secreted high levels of well-known invasion promoting proteins, a Matrigel invasion assay showed U87 cells to be eight times more invasive than U118 cells, suggesting that additional proteins secreted by U87 cells may contribute to the highly invasive phenotype. Indeed, we identified a number of proteins highly or exclusively expressed by U87 cells as compared to the less invasive cell lines. The most striking of these include ADAM9, ADAM10, cathepsin B, cathepsin L1, osteopontin, neuropilin-1, semaphorin-7A, suprabasin, and chitinase-3-like protein 1. U87 cells also expressed significantly low levels of some cell adhesion proteins such as periostin and EMILIN-1. Correlation of secretome profiles with relative levels of invasiveness using Pavlidis template matching further indicated potential roles for these proteins in U87 glioblastoma invasion.

Both, cell lines and tumor stem cells from primary glioblastoma multiforme, secrete high levels of fibronectin which when cleaved by MMPs forms an extracellular substrate. Subsequently, forming and interacting with their own microenvironment, glioblastoma multiforme cells are licensed to invade their surroundings. Mechanistic study revealed that NF-ÎºB inhibition, either genetically or pharmacologically, by treatment with Disulfiram, significantly abolished the invasive phenotype in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.

We investigated the modulated cell proliferation and invasiveness by EMP in vitro. Methods: We determined the relative survival rate by cell proliferation assay and the percent survival fraction by monotetrazolium assay. Furthermore, an invasion index was used to quantify the migrating and invasive potential of the human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, in Boiden's chamber with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel; Collaborative Research, Lexington, MA). Results: We found that 0.5 mumol/L EMP had no effect in any of the assays. Concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mumol/L demonstrated a concentration- and time-dependent depression in all of the assays. A range of drug concentration of EMP, 1 to 10 mumol/L, in which cell invasiveness was successfully inhibited, was comparable with antiproliferative capacity. Conclusion: The data add to the findings that EMP not only offers selective antiproliferative activity against glioblastoma but also reduces invasiveness, consistent with its main mechanism of action.

This is consistent with the effects of curcumin in a variety of experimental models of neurodegeneration, where the molecular events partially overlap with GBM. In fact, curcumin broadly affects various signaling pathways, which are similarly affected in cell degeneration and cell differentiation. The antitumoral effects of curcumin include growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, anti-migration and anti-invasion, as well as chemo- and radio-sensitizing activity. Remarkably, most of these effects rely on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent ATG induction. In addition, curcumin targets undifferentiated and highly tumorigenic GBM cancer stem cells (GSCs). When rescuing ATG with curcumin, the tumorigenic feature of GSCs is suppressed, thus counteracting GBM establishment and growth.

We have recently assembled a proteogenomic dataset of 87 GB clinical samples of varying survival rates. Following RNA-seq and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analysis, we identified several differentially expressed genes and proteins, including some known cancer-related pathways and some less established that showed higher expression in short-term (<6 months) survivors (STS) compared to LTS. One such target found was deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), which is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of hypusine, an unusual amino acid essential for the function of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which promotes tumor growth.

This research aims to identify the prognostic significance of invasion-related extracellular (ECM) components. Methods: Patient groups with different prognoses were created (OS: group A <16 months, group B > 16 months), and internationally recognized prognostic markers (IDH1 mutation and MGMT promoter hyper-methylation) were tested in the flash-frozen tumor samples. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of 46 invasion-related ECM molecules were measured. Results: Clinical data of the patients who have been operated on at the University of Debrecen Clinical Center Department of Neurosurgery and treated at the Department of Clinical Oncology showed no significant differences except for survival data (OS and PFS), and reoperation rate. All samples were IDH wild type. MGMT promoter hypermethylation rate showed significant differences (28.6% vs 68.8%). The expressional pattern of the invasion-related ECM molecules, i.e. the invasion spectrum also showed major differences, integrin Î²2, cadherin-12, FLT4/VEGFR-3 and versican molecules having signficantly different mRNA levels. The accuracy of the inivasion spectrum was tested by statistical classifier, 83.3% of the samples was sorted correctly, PPV was 0.93. Conclusion: The difference found in the reoperation rate when comparing different prognostic groups aligns with literature data. MGMG promoter region methylation data in Hungarian samples has not been published yet, and further confirming current knowledge urges the implementation of MGMT promoter analysis in clinical practice.

Metformin exerts antitumor effects in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) inhibiting CLIC1 activity, but its low potency hampers its translation in clinical settings. Methods: We synthesized a small library of novel biguanide-based compounds that were tested as antiproliferative agents for GSCs derived from human glioblastomas, in vitro using 2D and 3D cultures and in vivo in the zebrafish model. Compounds were compared to metformin for both potency and efficacy in the inhibition of GSC proliferation in vitro (MTT, Trypan blue exclusion assays, and EdU labeling) and in vivo (zebrafish model), migration (Boyden chamber assay), invasiveness (Matrigel invasion assay), self-renewal (spherogenesis assay), and CLIC1 activity (electrophysiology recordings), as well as for the absence of off-target toxicity (effects on normal stem cells and toxicity for zebrafish and chick embryos). Results: We identified Q48 and Q54 as two novel CLIC1 blockers, characterized by higher antiproliferative potency than metformin in vitro, in both GSC 2D cultures and 3D spheroids. Q48 and Q54 also impaired GSC self-renewal, migration and invasion, and displayed low systemic in vivo toxicity. Q54 reduced in vivo proliferation of GSCs xenotransplanted in zebrafish hindbrain. Target specificity was confirmed by recombinant CLIC1 binding experiments using microscale thermophoresis approach. Finally, we characterized GSCs from GBMs spontaneously expressing low CLIC1 protein, demonstrating their ability to grow in vivo and to retain stem-like phenotype and functional features in vitro. In these GSCs, Q48 and Q54 displayed reduced potency and efficacy as antiproliferative agents as compared to high CLIC1-expressing tumors. However, in 3D cultures, metformin and Q48 (but not Q54) inhibited proliferation, which was dependent on the inhibition dihydrofolate reductase activity. Conclusions: These data highlight that, while CLIC1 is dispensable for the development of a subset of glioblastomas, it acts as a booster of proliferation in the majority of these tumors and its functional expression is required for biguanide antitumor class-effects. In particular, the biguanide-based derivatives Q48 and Q54, represent the leads to develop novel compounds endowed with better pharmacological profiles than metformin, to act as CLIC1-blockers for the treatment of CLIC1-expressing glioblastomas, in a precision medicine approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135603

Glioblastoma tissues from 19 patients and two glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and LN229) were used in this study. The effects of miR-148a on cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were assessed. Glioblastomas were xenografted in nude mice to examine the effects of miR-148a overexpression on tumor growth in vivo. Levels of ITGA9 mRNA and protein in glioblastoma tissues were detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The interaction between miR-148a and ITGA9 was determined by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that the overexpression of miR-148a decreases the proliferation, clustering, migration, and invasiveness of U87 and LN229 cells and inhibits the tumorigenicity of xenografted glioblastomas. We confirmed that ITGA9 is the target of miR-148a. Restoration of ITGA9 expression reversed the decreased viability, migration, and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells induced by miR-148a overexpression. Our findings indicate that miR-148a can suppress the malignant phenotype of glioblastoma by targeting ITGA9 and identify ITGA9 as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31489579
"""A systematic review of microRNA in glioblastoma multiforme: micro-modulators in the mesenchymal mode of migration and invasion.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable form of brain cancer with a very poor prognosis. Because of its highly invasive nature, it is impossible to remove all tumor cells during surgical resection, making relapse inevitable. Further research into the regulatory mechanism underpinning GBM pathogenesis is therefore warranted, and over the past decade, there has been an increased focus on the functional role of microRNA (miRNA). This systematic review aims to present a comprehensive overview of all the available literature on the expression profiles and function of miRNA in GBM. Here, we have reviewed 163 papers and identified 253 upregulated, 95 downregulated, and 17 disputed miRNAs with respect to expression levels; 85 % of these miRNAs have not yet been functionally characterized. A focus in this study has been 26 interesting miRNAs involved in the mesenchymal mode of migration and invasion, demonstrating the importance of miRNAs in the context of the cellular niche. Both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs were found to affect target genes involved in cell migration, cytoskeletal rearrangement, invasiveness, and angiogenesis. Clearly, the distinct functional properties of these miRNAs need further investigation and might hold a great potential in future molecular therapies targeting GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23054677
"""Sensing invasion: cell surface receptors driving spreading of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumour in adults. One main source of its high malignancy is the invasion of isolated tumour cells into the surrounding parenchyma, which makes surgical resection an insufficient therapy in nearly all cases. The invasion is triggered by several cell surface receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), TGF-beta receptor, integrins, immunoglobulins, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family, cytokine receptors, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptors. The cross-talk between cell-surface receptors and the redundancy of downstream effectors make analysis of invasive signals even more complex. Therapies involving inhibition of single receptors do not give promising outcomes and a thorough knowledge of invasive signals of common and exclusive signalling components is required for design of best combinatory treatment schemes to fight the disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19688773
"""Glioblastoma cells: a heterogeneous and fatal tumor interacting with the parenchyma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are considered to be one of the deadliest human cancers, characterized by a high proliferative rate, aggressive invasiveness and insensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy, as well as a short patient survival period. Moreover, GBMs are among the most vascularized and invasive cancers in humans. Angiogenesis in GBMs is correlated with the grade of malignancy and is inversely correlated with patient survival. One of the first steps in tumor invasions is migration. GBM cells have the ability to infiltrate and disrupt physical barriers such as basement membranes, extracellular matrix and cell junctions. The invasion process includes the overexpression of several members of a super-family of zinc-based proteinases, the Metzincin, in particular a sub-group, metalloproteinases. Another interesting aspect is that, inside the GBM tissue, there are up to 30% of microglia or macrophages. However, little is known about the immune performance and interactions of the microglia with GBMs. These singular properties of GBMs will be described here. A sub-population of cells with stem-like properties may be the source of tumors since, apparently, GBM stem cells (GSCs) are highly resistant to current cancer treatments. These cancer therapies, while killing the majority of tumor cells, ultimately fail in GBM treatment because they do not eliminate GSCs, which survive to regenerate new tumors. Finally, GBM patient prognostic has shown little improvement in decades. In this context, we will discuss how the membrane-acting toxins called cytolysins can be a potential new tool for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21641917
"""Functional Graphene for Peritumoral Brain Microenvironment Modulation Therapy in Glioblastoma.""","""Peritumoral brain invasion is the main target to cure glioblastoma. Chemoradiotherapy and targeted therapies fail to combat peritumoral relapse. Brain inaccessibility and tumor heterogeneity explain this failure, combined with overlooking the peritumor microenvironment. Reduce graphene oxide (rGO) provides a unique opportunity to modulate the local brain microenvironment. Multimodal graphene impacts are reported on glioblastoma cells in vitro but fail when translated in vivo because of low diffusion. This issue is solved by developing a new rGO formulation involving ultramixing during the functionalization with polyethyleneimine (PEI) leading to the formation of highly water-stable rGO-PEI. Wide mice brain diffusion and biocompatibility are demonstrated. Using an invasive GL261 model, an anti-invasive effect is observed. A major unexpected modification of the peritumoral area is also observed with the neutralization of gliosis. In vitro, mechanistic investigations are performed using primary astrocytes and cytokine array. The result suggests that direct contact of rGO-PEIUT neutralizes astrogliosis, decreasing several proinflammatory cytokines that would explain a bystander tumor anti-invasive effect. rGO also significantly downregulates several proinvasive/protumoral cytokines at the tumor cell level. The results open the way to a new microenvironment anti-invasive nanotherapy using a new graphene nanomaterial that is optimized for in vivo brain delivery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36732906

"""The critical role of ERK in death resistance and invasiveness of hypoxia-selected glioblastoma cells.""","""Background: The rapid growth of tumor parenchyma leads to chronic hypoxia that can result in the selection of cancer cells with a more aggressive behavior and death-resistant potential to survive and proliferate. Thus, identifying the key molecules and molecular mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic changes associated with chronic hypoxia has valuable implications for the development of a therapeutic modality. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular basis of the phenotypic changes triggered by chronic repeated hypoxia. Methods: Hypoxia-resistant T98G (HRT98G) cells were selected by repeated exposure to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Cell death rate was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method and protein expression levels were examined by western blot analysis. The invasive phenotype of the tumor cells was determined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of proteins in the brain tumor samples. The Student T-test and Pearson Chi-Square test was used for statistical analyses. Results: We demonstrate that chronic repeated hypoxic exposures cause T98G cells to survive low oxygen tension. As compared with parent cells, hypoxia-selected T98G cells not only express higher levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and phosphorylated ERK, but they also have a more invasive potential in Matrigel invasion chambers. Activation or suppression of ERK pathways with a specific activator or inhibitor, respectively, indicates that ERK is a key molecule responsible for death resistance under hypoxic conditions and a more invasive phenotype. Finally, we show that the activation of ERK is more prominent in malignant glioblastomas exposed to hypoxia than in low grade astrocytic glial tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggests that activation of ERK plays a pivotal role in death resistance under chronic hypoxia and phenotypic changes related to the invasive phenotype of HRT98G cells compared to parent cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161638
"""Id-1 is a key transcriptional regulator of glioblastoma aggressiveness and a novel therapeutic target.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary adult brain tumors. A majority of glioblastomas grow invasively into distant brain tissue, leading to tumor recurrence, which is ultimately incurable. It is, therefore, essential to discover master regulators that control glioblastoma invasiveness and target them therapeutically. We show here that the transcriptional regulator Id-1 plays a critical role in modulating the invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines and primary glioblastoma cells. Id-1 expression levels positively correlate with glioma cell invasiveness in culture and with histopathologic grades in patient biopsies. Id-1 knockdown dramatically reduces glioblastoma cell invasion that is accompanied by profound morphologic changes and robust reduction in expression levels of 'mesenchymal' markers, as well as inhibition of self-renewal potential and downregulation of glioma stem cell markers. Importantly, genetic knockdown of Id-1 leads to a significant increase in survival in an orthotopic model of human glioblastoma. Furthermore, we show that a nontoxic compound, cannabidiol, significantly downregulates Id-1 gene expression and associated glioma cell invasiveness and self-renewal. In addition, cannabidiol significantly inhibits the invasion of glioblastoma cells through an organotypic brain slice and glioma progression in vivo. Our results suggest that Id-1 regulates multiple tumor-promoting pathways in glioblastoma and that drugs targeting Id-1 represent a novel and promising strategy for improving the therapy and outcome of patients with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23243024

Activation of sex hormone receptors is involved in glioblastomas progression. Tibolone (TIB) is a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator widely prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent bone lost. The effects of TIB on the growth of glioblastoma are unknown. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effects of TIB on cell number, migration, and invasion of two derived human glioblastoma cell lines (U251 MG and U87), as well as the role of this steroid in estrogen and progesterone receptors activity and content. Methods: U251-MG and U87 human glioblastoma cell lines were grown with different doses of TIB. The number of cells was determined and migration and invasion tests were carried out. Protein expression was performed by Western blot. Results: We observed that TIB (10 nM) increased the number of cells by inducing proliferation with no effects on cell migration or invasion. The increase in cell proliferation induced by TIB was blocked by estrogen (ERs) or progesterone receptor (PRs) antagonists, ICI 182, 780 and RU 486, suggesting that these receptors mediate proliferating actions of TIB; TIB also modified the content of ERs and PRs by increasing ER-Î±, ER-Î², and PR-B, while decreased PR-A.

Current bioscience has begun to depict more clearly the signalling pathways that are responsible for high-grade glioma initiation, migration, and invasion, opening the door for molecular-based targeted therapy. As such, the application of viruses such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a novel biological bullet to specifically target aberrant signalling in GBM has brought new hope. The abnormal proliferation and aggressive invasion behaviour of GBM is reported to be associated with aberrant Rac1 protein signalling. NDV interacts with Rac1 upon viral entry, syncytium induction, and actin reorganization of the infected cell as part of the replication process. Ultimately, intracellular stress leads the infected glioma cell to undergo cell death. In this review, we describe the characteristics of malignant glioma and the aberrant genetics that drive its aggressive phenotype, and we focus on the use of oncolytic NDV in GBM-targeted therapy and the interaction of NDV in GBM signalling that leads to inhibition of GBM proliferation and invasion, and subsequently, cell death.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25243137
"""p73 promotes glioblastoma cell invasion by directly activating POSTN (periostin) expression.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme is one of the most highly metastatic cancers and constitutes 70% of all gliomas. Despite aggressive treatments these tumours have an exceptionally bad prognosis, mainly due to therapy resistance and tumour recurrence. Here we show that the transcription factor p73 confers an invasive phenotype by directly activating expression of POSTN (periostin, HGNC:16953) in glioblastoma cells. Knock down of endogenous p73 reduces invasiveness and chemo-resistance, and promotes differentiation in vitro. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays we demonstrate that POSTN, an integrin binding protein that has recently been shown to play a major role in metastasis, is a transcriptional target of TAp73. We further show that POSTN overexpression is sufficient to rescue the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells after p73 knock down. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis revealed that an intact p73/ POSTN axis, where POSTN and p73 expression is correlated, predicts bad prognosis in several cancer types. Taken together, our results support a novel role of TAp73 in controlling glioblastoma cell invasion by regulating the expression of the matricellular protein POSTN.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26930720

Angiogenesis in glioma has recently gotten more attention and its molecular aspects have been published; however, these were not complemented with ultrastructural evidence. Our ultrastructural examination of glioma vessels reveals several unique and critical features related to their mechanisms of progression and metastasis strategy. The detailed ultrastructural survey of 18 isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDH1-wt) glioblastomas and 12 isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant (IDH1-mt) High-grade gliomas indicated that tumor vessels of both types had undergone deformities such as the thickening of the vessel wall (VW) and proliferation of the basement membrane, contour distortions, abnormal and discontinuous basal lamina, tumor cells' invasion and colonization of VW, disappearance of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, as well as the formation of a continuous ring of tumor cells attached to the luminal side of VW in numerous cases. The latter feature is a clear sign of vascular mimicry (VM) that was previously suggested in gliomas but never shown by TEM. Additionally, the vascular invasion was carried out by a large number of tumor cells and was accompanied by the accumulation of tumor lipids in the vessels' lumina and VWs; these two features are distinct for gliomas and may alter the course of the clinical presentation and overall prognosis.

"""Potential therapeutic implications of cancer stem cells in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor. Despite recent therapeutic advances in other cancers, the treatment of glioblastomas remains ineffective and essentially palliative. The treatment failure is a result of a number of causes, but we and others have demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) display relative resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs also contribute to tumor growth through the stimulation of angiogenesis, which has been shown to be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas. Cancer stem cells also have been hypothesized as a contributor to systemic metastases. While glioblastomas rarely metastasize beyond the central nervous system, glioblastomas invade into brain structures to prevent surgical cure and GSCs have an extremely invasive phenotype. Collectively, these studies and others suggest that GSCs may be important therapeutic targets not only to achieve cure but even reduce tumor relapse and improve overall survival. Many recent studies suggest that GSCs share core regulatory pathways with normal embryonic and somatic stem cells, but display important distinctions that provide clues into useful treatment targets. The cancer stem cell hypothesis may also modify our approaches in tumor imaging and biomarker development, but clinical validation waits.

To date, the impact of S1P on human glioblastoma is not fully understood. Particularly, the concerted role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and S1P in aggressive tumor behavior and angiogenesis remains to be elucidated. Results: To gain new insights in the effect of S1P on angiogenesis and invasion of this type of malignant tumor, we used microarrays to investigate the gene expression in glioblastoma as a response to S1P administration in vitro. We compared the expression profiles for the same cell lines under the influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important growth factor. We found a set of 72 genes that are significantly differentially expressed as a unique response to S1P. Based on the result of mining full-text articles from 20 scientific journals in the field of cancer research published over a period of five years, we inferred gene-gene interaction networks for these 72 differentially expressed genes. Among the generated networks, we identified a particularly interesting one. It describes a cascading event, triggered by S1P, leading to the transactivation of MMP-9 via neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). This interaction network has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of the role played by MMP-9 in invasive glioblastomas. Conclusion: Automated extraction of information from biological literature promises to play an increasingly important role in biological knowledge discovery. This is particularly true for high-throughput approaches, such as microarrays, and for combining and integrating data from different sources.

Here, we demonstrated that Spastin plays an active role in glioblastoma migration by showing a reduced migratory potential of T98G glioblastoma cells using real-time cell analysis (RTCA) in Spastin-depleted cells. Pull-down assays revealed that a cis-trans isomerase Pin1 interacts with Spastin through binding to the phosphorylated Pin1 recognition motifs in the microtubule-binding domain (MBD), and immunocytochemistry analysis showed that interaction with Pin1 directs Spastin to actin filaments in extended cell regions. Consequently, by utilizing RTCA, we proved that the migration and invasion capacity of T98G glioblastoma cells significantly increased with the overexpression of Spastin, of which the Pin1 recognition motifs in MBD are constitutively phosphorylated, while the overexpression of phospho-mutant form did not have a significant effect on migration and invasion of T98G glioblastoma cells.

A phase II clinical trial on relapsed glioblastoma patients demonstrated that targeted inhibition of CD95 signaling via the CD95 ligand (CD95L) binding and neutralizing Fc-fusion protein APG101 (asunercept) prolonged patient survival. Although CD95 signaling may be relevant for multiple aspects of tumor growth, the mechanism of action of APG101 in glioblastoma is not clear. APG101 action was examined by in vitro proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion assays with human and murine glioma and human microglial cells, as well as in vivo therapy studies with orthotopic gliomas and clinical data. APG101 inhibits CD95L-mediated invasion of glioma cells. APG101 treatment was effective in glioma-bearing mice, independently of the presence or absence of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, which should be sensitive to CD95L. Combined with radiotherapy, APG101 demonstrated a reduction of tumor growth, fewer tumor satellites, reduced activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) as well as prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice compared with radiotherapy alone. Inhibiting rather than inducing CD95 activity is a break-of-paradigm therapeutic approach for malignant gliomas. Evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, is provided that CD95L-binding fusion protein treatment enhanced the efficacy of radiotherapy and reduced unwanted proinfiltrative effects by reducing metalloproteinase activity by directly affecting the tumor cells.Implications: APG101 (asunercept) successfully used in a controlled phase II glioblastoma trial (NCT01071837) acts anti-invasively by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase signaling, resulting in additive effects together with radiotherapy and helping to further develop a treatment for this devastating disease.

Glioblastoma tumors are highly resistant to multimodal therapies and there is significant patient mortality within the first two years after prognosis. At present clinical treatments are palliative, not curative. Glioblastomas contain a high number of microglia and infiltrating macrophages, which are positively correlated with glioma grade and invasiveness. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. These cells constantly scan the brain and react promptly to any abnormality, removing detrimental factors and safeguarding the central nervous system against further damage. Microglia and macrophages that have colonized the glioblastoma display protumoral functions and promote tumor growth. The optically transparent zebrafish larva facilitates imaging of fluorescently labeled cells at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. It is therefore an excellent model to investigate microglia-glioma cell interactions at the early stages of tumor development. Here we provide several methods that can be used to study the early stages of microglia-glioma cell interactions in the zebrafish. We present a technique for the xenotransplantation of mammalian oncogenic cells into the zebrafish brain and provide advice for image capture and analysis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28129859
"""Microarray Analysis in Glioblastomas.""","""Microarray analysis in glioblastomas is done using either cell lines or patient samples as starting material. A survey of the current literature points to transcript-based microarrays and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based tissue microarrays as being the preferred methods of choice in cancers of neurological origin. Microarray analysis may be carried out for various purposes including the following: i. To correlate gene expression signatures of glioblastoma cell lines or tumors with response to chemotherapy (DeLay et al., Clin Cancer Res 18(10):2930-2942, 2012). ii. To correlate gene expression patterns with biological features like proliferation or invasiveness of the glioblastoma cells (Jiang et al., PLoS One 8(6):e66008, 2013). iii. To discover new tumor classificatory systems based on gene expression signature, and to correlate therapeutic response and prognosis with these signatures (Huse et al., Annu Rev Med 64(1):59-70, 2013; Verhaak et al., Cancer Cell 17(1):98-110, 2010). While investigators can sometimes use archived tumor gene expression data available from repositories such as the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus to answer their questions, new arrays must often be run to adequately answer specific questions. Here, we provide a detailed description of microarray methodologies, how to select the appropriate methodology for a given question, and analytical strategies that can be used. Experimental methodology for protein microarrays is outside the scope of this chapter, but basic sample preparation techniques for transcript-based microarrays are included here.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26113463
"""ST3GAL1-Associated Transcriptomic Program in Glioblastoma Tumor Growth, Invasion, and Prognosis.""","""Background: Cell surface sialylation is associated with tumor cell invasiveness in many cancers. Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumor and is highly infiltrative. ST3GAL1 sialyltransferase gene is amplified in a subclass of glioblastomas, and its role in tumor cell self-renewal remains unexplored. Methods: Self-renewal of patient glioma cells was evaluated using clonogenic, viability, and invasiveness assays. ST3GAL1 was identified from differentially expressed genes in Peanut Agglutinin-stained cells and validated in REMBRANDT (n = 390) and Gravendeel (n = 276) clinical databases. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upstream processes. TGFÎ² signaling on ST3GAL1 transcription was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Transcriptome analysis of ST3GAL1 knockdown cells was done to identify downstream pathways. A constitutively active FoxM1 mutant lacking critical anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ([APC/C]-Cdh1) binding sites was used to evaluate ST3Gal1-mediated regulation of FoxM1 protein. Finally, the prognostic role of ST3Gal1 was determined using an orthotopic xenograft model (3 mice groups comprising nontargeting and 2 clones of ST3GAL1 knockdown in NNI-11 [8 per group] and NNI-21 [6 per group]), and the correlation with patient clinical information. All statistical tests on patients' data were two-sided; other P values below are one-sided. Results: High ST3GAL1 expression defines an invasive subfraction with self-renewal capacity; its loss of function prolongs survival in a mouse model established from mesenchymal NNI-11 (P < .001; groups of 8 in 3 arms: nontargeting, C1, and C2 clones of ST3GAL1 knockdown). ST3GAL1 transcriptomic program stratifies patient survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.72 to 3.55, REMBRANDT P = 1.92 x 10â»â¸; HR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.94 to 4.30, Gravendeel P = 1.05 x 10â»Â¹Â¹), independent of age and histology, and associates with higher tumor grade and T2 volume (P = 1.46 x 10â»â´). TGFÎ² signaling, elevated in mesenchymal patients, correlates with high ST3GAL1 (REMBRANDT gliomacor = 0.31, P = 2.29 x 10â»Â¹â°; Gravendeel gliomacor = 0.50, P = 3.63 x 10â»Â²â°). The transcriptomic program upon ST3GAL1 knockdown enriches for mitotic cell cycle processes. FoxM1 was identified as a statistically significantly modulated gene (P = 2.25 x 10â»âµ) and mediates ST3Gal1 signaling via the (APC/C)-Cdh1 complex. Conclusions: The ST3GAL1-associated transcriptomic program portends poor prognosis in glioma patients and enriches for higher tumor grades of the mesenchymal molecular classification. We show that ST3Gal1-regulated self-renewal traits are crucial to the sustenance of glioblastoma multiforme growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26547933
"""Glioblastoma invasion and cooption depend on IRE1alpha endoribonuclease activity.""","""IRE1Î± is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane signaling protein and a cellular stress sensor. The protein harbors a cytosolic dual kinase/endoribonuclease activity required for adaptive responses to micro-environmental changes. In an orthotopic xenograft model of human glioma, invalidation of IRE1Î± RNase or/and kinase activities generated tumors with remarkably distinct phenotypes. Contrasting with the extensive angiogenesis observed in tumors derived from control cells, the double kinase/RNase invalidation reprogrammed mesenchymal differentiation of cancer cells and produced avascular and infiltrative glioblastomas with blood vessel co-option. In comparison, selective invalidation of IRE1Î± RNase did not compromise tumor angiogenesis but still elicited invasive features and vessel co-option. In vitro, IRE1Î± RNase deficient cells were also endowed with a higher ability to migrate. Constitutive activation of both enzymes led to wild-type-like lesions. The presence of IRE1Î±, but not its RNase activity, is therefore required for glioblastoma neovascularization, whereas invasion results only from RNase inhibition. In this model, two key mechanisms of tumor progression and cancer cell survival are functionally linked to IRE1Î±.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26325176

In this study, we observed that TAM-GBM cell hybrids existed in human GBM specimens as demonstrated by co-expression of glioma biomarkers (GFAP, IDH1R132H and PDGFRA) and macrophage biomarkers (CD68 and CD14). Furthermore, TAM-GBM cell hybrids could also be found in C57BL/6 mice orthotopically inoculated with mouse GBM cells labeled with RFP and after co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages from GFP-expressed mice with RFP-labeled GBM cells. The hybrids underwent nuclear reprogramming with unique gene expression profile as compared to parental cells. Moreover, glioma invasion-associated genes were enriched in the hybrids that possessed higher invasiveness, and more hybrids in the invasive margin of GBM were observed as compared to GBM core area. Our data demonstrate the presence of TAM-GBM cell hybrids that enhance GBM invasion.

We recently identified mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/FABP3) as a biomarker for invasive gliomas. Here, we demonstrate a novel function for MDGI in the maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity, thus rendering invasive glioma cells unexpectedly vulnerable to lysosomal membrane destabilization. MDGI silencing impaired trafficking of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cells resulting in significant alterations in the lipid composition of lysosomal membranes, and subsequent death of the patient-derived glioma cells via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). In a preclinical model, treatment of glioma-bearing mice with an antihistaminergic LMP-inducing drug efficiently eradicated invasive glioma cells and secondary tumours within the brain. This unexpected fragility of the aggressive infiltrating cells to LMP provides new opportunities for clinical interventions, such as re-positioning of an established antihistamine drug, to eradicate the inoperable, invasive, and chemo-resistant glioma cells from sustaining disease progression and recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31068339
"""Oct-3/4 promotes migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells.""","""As a result of increased glioblastoma migration and invasion into normal brain parenchyma, treatment of local tumor recurrence following initial treatment in glioblastoma patients remains challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated increased Oct-3/4 expression, a self-renewal regulator in stem cells, in glioblastomas. However, little is known regarding the influence of Oct-3/4 in glioblastoma cell invasiveness. The present study established Oct-3/4-overexpressing glioblastoma cells, which were prepared from human glioblastoma patients, to assess migration, invasion, and mRNA expression profiles of integrins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Compared with control cells, Oct-3/4 expressing-glioblastoma cells exhibited increased migration and invasion in wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays. Oct-3/4 overexpression resulted in upregulated FAK and c-Src expression, which mediate integrin signals. Vinculin accumulated along the leading edges of Oct-3/4 expressing-glioblastoma cells and associated with membrane ruffles during cell migration. Oct-3/4 expressing-cells exhibited increased MMP-13 mRNA expression and MMP-13 knockdown by shRNA suppressed cell invasion into Matrigel and organotypic brain slices. These results suggested that Oct-3/4 enhanced degradation of surrounding extracellular matrix by increasing MMP-13 expression and altering integrin signaling. Therefore, Oct-3/4 might contribute to tumor promoting activity in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21938739

However, the direction of growth is not much studied in vivo. In this study, we sought to study the dominant directions of tumour expansion/shrinkage pre-treatment. We examined fifty-six GBMs at two time-points: at radiological diagnosis and as part of the pre-operative planning, both with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs. The tumour volumes were semi-automatically segmented. A non-linear registration resulting in a deformation field characterizing the changes between the two time points was used together with the segmented tumours to determine the dominant directions of tumour change. To compute the degree of alignment between tumour growth vectors and WM fibres, an angle map was calculated. Our results demonstrate that tumours tend to grow predominantly along the WM, as evidenced by the dominant vector population with the maximum alignments. Our findings represent a step forward in investigating the hypothesis that tumour cells tend to migrate preferentially along the WM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29352231

In this study, we screened a library of 22 anti-invasive compounds (i.e., NF-kB, GSK-3-B, COX-2, and tubulin inhibitors) using glioblastoma U-251 MG cell spheroids. We evaluated toxicity and invasion inhibition using a 3D Matrigel invasion assay. We next selected three compounds that inhibited invasion and screened them in patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs). We developed a platform using available macros for FIJI/ImageJ to quantify invasion from the outer margin of organoids. Our data demonstrated that a high-throughput invasion screening can be done using both an established cell line and patient-derived 3D model systems. Tubulin inhibitor compounds had the best efficacy with U-251 MG cells, however, in ex vivo patient organoids the results were highly variable. Our results indicate that the efficacy of compounds is highly related to patient intra and inter-tumor heterogeneity.

"""The TWEAK receptor Fn14 is a potential cell surface portal for targeted delivery of glioblastoma therapeutics.""","""Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14; TNFRSF12A) is the cell surface receptor for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). The Fn14 gene is normally expressed at low levels in healthy tissues but expression is significantly increased after tissue injury and in many solid tumor types, including glioblastoma (GB; formerly referred to as 'GB multiforme'). GB is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor and the current standard-of-care therapeutic regimen has a relatively small impact on patient survival, primarily because glioma cells have an inherent propensity to invade into normal brain parenchyma, which invariably leads to tumor recurrence and patient death. Despite major, concerted efforts to find new treatments, a new GB therapeutic that improves survival has not been introduced since 2005. In this review article, we summarize studies indicating that (i) Fn14 gene expression is low in normal brain tissue but is upregulated in advanced brain cancers and, in particular, in GB tumors exhibiting the mesenchymal molecular subtype; (ii) Fn14 expression can be detected in glioma cells residing in both the tumor core and invasive rim regions, with the maximal levels found in the invading glioma cells located within normal brain tissue; and (iii) Tweak: Fn14 engagement as well as Fn14 overexpression can stimulate glioma cell migration, invasion and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. We also discuss two new therapeutic platforms that are currently in development that leverage Fn14 overexpression in GB tumors as a way to deliver cytotoxic agents to the glioma cells remaining after surgical resection while sparing normal healthy brain cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26300004
"""EGFRvIII-Stat5 Signaling Enhances Glioblastoma Cell Migration and Survival.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain malignancies in adults. Most GBM patients succumb to the disease less than 1 year after diagnosis due to the highly invasive nature of the tumor, which prevents complete surgical resection and gives rise to tumor recurrence. The invasive phenotype also confers radioresistant and chemoresistant properties to the tumor cells; therefore, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutics that target drivers of GBM invasion. Amplification of EGFR is observed in over 50% of GBM tumors, of which half concurrently overexpress the variant EGFRvIII, and expression of both receptors confers a worse prognosis. EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to promote tumor progression and invasion, in part, through activation of the Stat signaling pathway. Here, it is reported that EGFRvIII activates Stat5 and GBM invasion by inducing the expression of a previously established mediator of glioma cell invasion and survival: fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14). EGFRvIII-mediated induction of Fn14 expression is Stat5 dependent and requires activation of Src, whereas EGFR regulation of Fn14 is dependent upon Src-MEK/ERK-Stat3 activation. Notably, treatment of EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells with the FDA-approved Stat5 inhibitor pimozide blocked Stat5 phosphorylation, Fn14 expression, and cell migration and survival. Because EGFR inhibitors display limited therapeutic efficacy in GBM patients, the EGFRvIII-Stat5-Fn14 signaling pathway represents a node of vulnerability in the invasive GBM cell populations.Implications: Targeting critical effectors in the EGFRvIII-Stat5-Fn14 pathway may limit GBM tumor dispersion, mitigate therapeutic resistance, and increase survival.

"""ADAM17 promotes U87 glioblastoma stem cell migration and invasion.""","""Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are thought to contribute to the diffuse invasiveness of malignant gliomas. Emerging evidence supports a role for a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) in proteolytic ectodomain shedding of several EGFR-binding ligands, which subsequently activate PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways through EGFR phosphorylation thus mediating glioma invasiveness. However, it is not clear if ADAM17 also plays important roles in promoting GSC invasion. In this study, we isolated CD133+ GSCs from the human glioblastoma cell line U87 using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and demonstrated their increased invasive potential compared with matched non-stem tumor cells. Furthermore, we showed that CD133+ GSCs expressed higher levels of ADAM17. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that high expression levels of ADAM17 at the invasive front were correlated with the presence of CD133+ GSCs in human glioblastoma specimens. Stimulation with the ADAM17 agonist chemokine phorbol myristate acetate increased migration and invasion of GSCs, which was counteracted by ADAM17 knockdown. In addition, ADAM17 also induced CD133+ GSC invasion via activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These findings suggest that ADAM17 is involved in U87 GSC invasive process and may provide a potential therapeutic target for glioma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470260

The proteolytic profile and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were investigated using zymography and real-time qPCR. The EMT markers assessed were Snail-1, Snail-2, N-cadherin, Twist and vimentin. Invasion was investigated in vitro using extracellular matrix-coated Transwell inserts. In response to osmotic and mechanical pressure, GBM cell lines U87 and U251 and patient-derived neural oncospheres upregulated the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and/or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as some of the EMT markers tested. The adherent cell lines invaded more when placed in media of increased osmolality. Therefore, GBM respond to osmotic or mechanical pressure by increasing matrix degrading enzyme production, and adopting a phenotype reminiscent of EMT.

The hypothesis that environmental stimuli induce these phenotypic changes, including dedifferentiation into the stem cell phenotype which contributes to the high invasiveness and resultant poor outcome in GBM patients, is recently being proven. In the process of cancer invasion and metastasis, the phenotypic change has also been described as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This biological process is mainly dependent on hypoxic stimuli and also on transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) released from glioma stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and myeloid cells recruited by hypoxia.

Modeling the process of GBM invasion in real time is challenging as it requires both tumor and neural tissue compartments. Here, we demonstrate that human GBM spheroids possess the ability to spontaneously infiltrate early-stage cerebral organoids (eCOs). The resulting formation of hybrid organoids demonstrated an invasive tumor phenotype that was distinct from noncancerous adult neural progenitor (NP) spheroid incorporation into eCOs.

However, there is a dearth of such information on glioma stemlike cells. Here, we have addressed whether and how TNC may regulate the invasiveness of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) that give rise to glioma progenies. Methods: Transwell inserts coated with extracellular matrix proteins were used to determine the role of TNC in BTIC invasion. Microarray analysis, lentiviral constructs, RNA interference-mediated knockdown, and activity assay ascertained the role of proteases in TNC-stimulated BTIC invasion in culture. Involvement of proteases was validated using orthotopic brain xenografts in mice. Results: TNC stimulated BTIC invasiveness in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner. A global gene expression screen identified the metalloproteinase ADAM-9 as a potential regulator of TNC-stimulated BTIC invasiveness, and this was corroborated by an increase of ADAM-9 protein in 4 glioma patient-derived BTIC lines. Notably, RNA interference to ADAM-9, as well as inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), attenuated TNC-stimulated ADAM-9 expression, proteolytic activity, and BTIC invasiveness. The relevance of ADAM-9 to tumor invasiveness was validated using resected human glioblastoma specimens and orthotopic xenografts where elevation of ADAM-9 and TNC expression was prominent at the invasive front of the tumor.

GBM cells demonstrate augmented invasive capabilities following exposure to the current gold standard treatment of radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ), resulting in rapid disease recurrence. Elucidating the mechanisms employed by post-treatment invasive GBM cells is critical to the development of more effective therapies. In this study, we utilized a NanostringÂ® Cancer Progression gene expression panel to identify candidate genes that may be involved in enhanced GBM cell invasion after treatment with clinically relevant doses of RT/TMZ. Our findings identified thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) as a pro-invasive gene that is upregulated in these cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that THBS1 localised within functional matrix-degrading invadopodia that formed on the surface of GBM cells. Furthermore, overexpression of THBS1 resulted in enhanced GBM cell migration and secretion of MMP-2, which was reduced with silencing of THBS1. The preliminary data demonstrates that THBS1 is associated with invadopodia in GBM cells and is likely involved in the invadopodia-mediated invasive process in GBM cells exposed to RT/TMZ treatment.

To investigate the molecular mechanism supporting GBM invasion, new physiological models enabling in-depth characterization of protein dynamics during invasion are required. These observations would pave the way to the discovery of novel targets to block tumor infiltration and improve patient outcomes.

We recently used microRNA expression profiles to subclassify glioblastoma into five genetically and clinically distinct subclasses, and showed that microRNAs both define and contribute to the phenotypes of these subclasses. Here we show that miR-29a activates a multi-faceted growth and invasion program that promotes glioblastoma aggressiveness. Methods: microRNA expression profiles from 197 glioblastomas were analyzed to identify the candidate miRNAs that are correlated to glioblastoma aggressiveness. The candidate miRNA, miR-29a, was further studied in vitro and in vivo. Results: Members of the miR-29 subfamily display increased expression in the two glioblastoma subclasses with the worst prognoses (astrocytic and neural). We observed that miR-29a is among the microRNAs that are most positively-correlated with PTEN copy number in glioblastoma, and that miR-29a promotes glioblastoma growth and invasion in part by targeting PTEN. In PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells, however, miR-29a nevertheless activates AKT by downregulating the metastasis suppressor, EphB3. In addition, miR-29a robustly promotes invasion in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells by repressing translation of the Sox4 transcription factor, and this upregulates the invasion-promoting protein, HIC5. Indeed, we identified Sox4 as the most anti-correlated predicted target of miR-29a in glioblastoma. Importantly, inhibition of endogenous miR-29a decreases glioblastoma growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo, and increased miR-29a expression in glioblastoma specimens correlates with decreased patient survival. Conclusions: Taken together, these data identify miR-29a as a master regulator of glioblastoma growth and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30683134
"""The autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor cascade: proposal of a novel potential therapeutic target for treating glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Its prognosis is one of the worst among all cancer types, and it is considered a fatal malignancy, incurable with conventional therapeutic strategies. As the bioactive multifunctional lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is well recognized to be involved in the tumorigenesis of cancers by acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists and LPA synthesis inhibitors have been proposed as promising drugs for cancer treatment. Six LPARs, named LPA1-6, are currently recognized. Among them, LPA1 is the dominant LPAR in the CNS and is highly expressed in GBM in combination with the overexpression of autotaxin (ATX), the enzyme (a phosphodiesterase, which is a potent cell motility-stimulating factor) that produces LPA.Invasion is a defining hallmark of GBM. LPA is significantly related to cell adhesion, cell motility, and invasion through the Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac. LPA1 is responsible for LPA-driven cell motility, which is attenuated by LPA4. GBM is among the most vascular human tumors. Although anti-angiogenic therapy (through the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) was established, sufficient results have not been obtained because of the increased invasiveness triggered by anti-angiogenesis. As both ATX and LPA play a significant role in angiogenesis, similar to VEGF, inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis may be beneficial as a two-pronged therapy that includes anti-angiogenic and anti-invasion therapy. Conventional approaches to GBM are predominantly directed at cell proliferation. Recurrent tumors regrow from cells that have invaded brain tissues and are less proliferative, and are thus quite resistant to conventional drugs and radiation, which preferentially kill rapidly proliferating cells. A novel approach that targets this invasive subpopulation of GBM cells may improve the prognosis of GBM. Patients with GBM that contacts the subventricular zone (SVZ) have decreased survival. A putative source of GBM cells is the SVZ, the largest area of neurogenesis in the adult human brain. GBM stem cells in the SVZ that are positive for the neural stem cell surface antigen CD133 are highly tumorigenic and enriched in recurrent GBM. LPA1 expression appears to be increased in these cells.

Our previous results have shown that melatonin exerts antimigratory and anti-invasive action in glioblastoma cells under normoxia. However, the effect of melatonin on migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells under hypoxic condition remains poorly understood. Here, we show that melatonin strongly reduced hypoxia-mediated invasion and migration of U251 and U87 glioblastoma cells. In addition, we found that melatonin significantly blocked HIF-1Î± protein expression and suppressed the expression of downstream target genes, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, melatonin destabilized hypoxia-induced HIF-1Î± protein via its antioxidant activity against ROS produced by glioblastoma cells in response to hypoxia. Along with this, HIF-1Î± silencing by small interfering RNA markedly inhibited glioblastoma cell migration and invasion, and this appeared to be associated with MMP-2 and VEGF under hypoxia. Taken together, our findings suggest that melatonin suppresses hypoxia-induced glioblastoma cell migration and invasion via inhibition of HIF-1Î±.

"""Inhibition of in vivo tumorigenicity and invasiveness of a human glioblastoma cell line transfected with antisense uPAR vectors.""","""Our previous studies showed that glioblastomas express increased urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (uPARs) in comparison to low-grade gliomas (Yamamoto et al., Cancer Res., 54, 5016-5020, 1994). To explore whether downregulation of uPAR inhibits tumor formation and invasiveness, a human glioblastoma cell line was transfected with a cDNA construct corresponding to 300 bp of the human uPAR's 5' end in an antisense orientation, resulting in a reduced number of uPA receptors. Co-culture studies with tumor spheroids and fetal rat brain aggregates showed that antisense SNB19-AS1 cells expressing reduced uPAR failed to invade fetal rat brain aggregates. Intracerebral injection of SNB19-AS1 stable transfectants failed to form tumors and were negative for uPAR expression in nude mice. Thus uPAR appears in this model to be essential for tumorigenicity and invasion of glioblastomas in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9219733
"""Hypoxia-Mediated Mechanisms Associated with Antiangiogenic Treatment Resistance in Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are malignant tumors characterized by their vascularity and invasive capabilities. Antiangiogenic therapy (AAT) is a treatment option that targets GBM-associated vasculature to mitigate the growth of GBMs. However, AAT demonstrates transient effects because many patients eventually develop resistance to this treatment. Several recent studies attempt to explain the molecular and biochemical basis of resistance to AAT in GBM patients. Experimental investigations suggest that the induction of extensive intratumoral hypoxia plays a key role in GBM escape from AAT. In this review, we examine AAT resistance in GBMs, with an emphasis on six potential hypoxia-mediated mechanisms: enhanced invasion and migration, including increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and activation of the c-MET tyrosine kinase pathway; shifts in cellular metabolism, including up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1Î±'s downstream processes and the Warburg effect; induction of autophagy; augmentation of GBM stem cell self-renewal; possible implications of GBM-endothelial cell transdifferentiation; and vasoformative responses, including vasculogenesis, alternative angiogenic pathways, and vascular mimicry. Juxtaposing recent studies on well-established resistance pathways with that of emerging mechanisms highlights the overall complexity of GBM treatment resistance while also providing direction for further investigation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28284719
"""XRN2 Is Required for Cell Motility and Invasion in Glioblastomas.""","""One of the major obstacles in treating brain cancers, particularly glioblastoma multiforme, is the occurrence of secondary tumor lesions that arise in areas of the brain and are inoperable while obtaining resistance to current therapeutic agents. Thus, gaining a better understanding of the cellular factors that regulate glioblastoma multiforme cellular movement is imperative. In our study, we demonstrate that the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN2 is important to the invasive nature of glioblastoma. A loss of XRN2 decreases cellular speed, displacement, and movement through a matrix of established glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. Additionally, a loss of XRN2 abolishes tumor formation in orthotopic mouse xenograft implanted with G55 glioblastoma multiforme cells. One reason for these observations is that loss of XRN2 disrupts the expression profile of several cellular factors that are important for tumor invasion in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Importantly, XRN2 mRNA and protein levels are elevated in glioblastoma multiforme patient samples. Elevation in XRN2 mRNA also correlates with poor overall patient survival. These data demonstrate that XRN2 is an important cellular factor regulating one of the major obstacles in treating glioblastomas and is a potential molecular target that can greatly enhance patient survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35563787

In glioblastoma, NF1 loss of function plays a major role in inducing the mesenchymal (MES) subtype and, therefore defining the most aggressive glioblastoma. This is associated with an immune signature and mediated via the NF1-MAPK-FOSL1 axis. Specifically, increased invasion seems to be regulated via mutations in the leucine-rich domain (LRD) of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin. Novel targets for therapy may arise from neurofibromin deficiency-associated cellular mechanisms that are summarised in this review.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008787
"""Netrin-1-induced activation of Notch signaling mediates glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressively invasive human brain cancer, which lacks effective treatment. The axonal guidance protein, netrin-1, is overexpressed in glioblastoma tumor biopsies. In Matrigel invasion assays we observed that experimental overexpression of netrin-1 increased cell invasiveness and its downregulation decreased invasiveness. Using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry protein identification we found that netrin-1 forms a complex with both Notch2 and Jagged1. Recombinant netrin-1 colocalized with Jagged1 and Notch2 at the cell surface and was also present in the intracellular vesicles with Jagged1, but not with Notch2. Netrin-1 activated Notch signaling and subsequent glioblastoma cell invasion. Interestingly, the recombinant central domain of netrin-1 counteracted the effects of the full-length netrin-1: it inhibited glioblastoma cell invasion and Notch activation by retaining the Notch signaling complex at the cell surface. This finding may give rise to therapeutic applications. These results reveal a new mechanism leading to glioblastoma cell invasion, in which netrin-1 activates Notch signaling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23549787
"""MicroRNA-296-5p Promotes Invasiveness through Downregulation of Nerve Growth Factor Receptor and Caspase-8.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are very difficult to treat and their aggressiveness is one of the main reasons for this as well as for the frequent recurrences. MicroRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate their target genes through interaction between their seed sequence and 3'UTR of the target mRNAs. We previously reported that miR-296-3p is regulated by neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and enhances the invasiveness of GBM cells via SOCS2/STAT3. In this study, we investigated whether miR-296-5p, which originates from the same precursor miRNA as miR-296-3p, can increase the invasiveness of GBM cells. It was observed that miR-296-5p potentiated the invasion of various GBM cells including LN229, T98G, and U87MG. Through bioinformatics approaches, two genes were identified as miR-296-5p targets: caspase-8 (CASP8) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). From results obtained from Ago2 immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we found that miR-296-5p downregulates CASP8 and NGFR through direct interaction between seed sequence of the miRNA and 3'UTR of the target mRNA. Knockdown of CASP8 or NGFR also increased the invasive ability of GBM cells, indicating that CASP8 and NGFR are involved in potentiation of invasiveness by miR-296-5p. Consistent with our findings, CASP8 was downregulated in brain metastatic lung cancer cells, which have a high level of miR-296-5p, compared to parental cells, suggesting that miR-296-5p may be generally associated with the acquisition of invasiveness. Collectively, our results implicate miR-296-5p as a potential cause of invasiveness in cancer and suggest it as a promising therapeutic target for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927008

The function and expression of CCRL2 in cancer is not understood at present. Here we report that CCRL2 expression level is elevated in human glioma patient samples and cell lines. The magnitude of increase is positively associated with increasing tumor grade, with the highest level observed in grade IV glioblastoma. By gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we further showed that CCRL2 did not regulate the growth of human glioblatoma U87 and U373 cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that over-expression of CCRL2 significantly enhanced the migration rate and invasiveness of the glioblastoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that elevated CCRL2 in glioma promotes cell migration and invasion.

"""Adaptive mechanoproperties mediated by the formin FMN1 characterize glioblastoma fitness for invasion.""","""Glioblastoma are heterogeneous tumors composed of highly invasive and highly proliferative clones. Heterogeneity in invasiveness could emerge from discrete biophysical properties linked to specific molecular expression. We identified clones of patient-derived glioma propagating cells that were either highly proliferative or highly invasive and compared their cellular architecture, migratory, and biophysical properties. We discovered that invasiveness was linked to cellular fitness. The most invasive cells were stiffer, developed higher mechanical forces on the substrate, and moved stochastically. The mechano-chemical-induced expression of the formin FMN1 conferred invasive strength that was confirmed in patient samples. Moreover, FMN1 expression was also linked to motility in other cancer and normal cell lines, and its ectopic expression increased fitness parameters. Mechanistically, FMN1 acts from the microtubule lattice and promotes a robust mechanical cohesion, leading to highly invasive motility.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34559979

Differential expression of these biomolecules in several cancer models makes them attractive therapeutic targets for the development of miRNA-based cancer treatments despite the hurdles associated with such an approach. In addition, systemic release of miRNAs also positions them as attractive tools for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This review initially looks at differentially expressed miRNAs in GBMs. Our focus will next be directed towards circulating miRNAs and how these molecules could be leveraged for cancer diagnosis as well as for the assessment of patient response to chemotherapeutic treatments.

An examination of adult cerebral glioblastoma biopsy material for the expression of adhesive proteins that might potentiate adhesion and invasion demonstrated tumor cell-associated vitronectin (5/5). In contrast, vitronectin was not detected associated with glial cells in low grade astroglial tumors (0/4), reactive astrogliosis (0/4), or in normal adult cortex and cerebral white matter (0/5). Also, a wide variety of other adhesive ligands were absent from the glioblastoma tumor parenchyma. The alpha v beta 3 integrin was the only vitronectin receptor identified in glioblastoma tumors in situ, and was also not expressed on low grade astroglial-derived tumors, reactive astrogliosis, or on glia or neurons in normal adult cortex and cerebral white matter. In a cell attachment assay, cultured glioblastoma cells attached to the parenchyma of glioblastoma tumor cryostat sections at the sites of vitronectin expression, but failed to attach to normal brain. This adhesion was inhibited by antibodies directed against vitronectin, the alpha v beta 3 integrin, and with an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide.

SULF2 protein is increased in an important subset of human GBM and it helps regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and tumor growth in a murine model of the disease. By altering ligand binding to HSPGs, SULF2 has the potential to modify the extracellular availability of factors important in a number of cell processes including proliferation, chemotaxis, and migration. Diffuse invasion of malignant tumor cells into surrounding healthy brain is a characteristic feature of GBM that makes therapy challenging.

"""Ultrasound-responsive nutlin-loaded nanoparticles for combined chemotherapy and piezoelectric treatment of glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), also known as grade IV astrocytoma, represents the most aggressive primary brain tumor. The complex genetic heterogeneity, the acquired drug resistance, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limit the efficacy of the current therapies, with effectiveness demonstrated only in a small subset of patients. To overcome these issues, here we propose an anticancer approach based on ultrasound-responsive drug-loaded organic piezoelectric nanoparticles. This anticancer nanoplatform consists of nutlin-3a-loaded ApoE-functionalized P(VDF-TrFE) nanoparticles, that can be remotely activated with ultrasound-based mechanical stimulations to induce drug release and to locally deliver anticancer electric cues. The combination of chemotherapy treatment with chronic piezoelectric stimulation resulted in activation of cell apoptosis and anti-proliferation pathways, induction of cell necrosis, inhibition of cancer migration, and reduction of cell invasiveness in drug-resistant GBM cells. Obtained results pave the way for the use of innovative multifunctional nanomaterials in less invasive and more focused anticancer treatments, able to reduce drug resistance in GBM. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Piezoelectric hybrid lipid-polymeric nanoparticles, efficiently encapsulating a non-genotoxic drug (nutlin-3a) and functionalized with a peptide (ApoE) that enhances their passage through the BBB, are proposed. Upon ultrasound stimulation, nanovectors resulted able to reduce cell migration, actin polymerization, and invasion ability of glioma cells, while fostering apoptotic and necrotic events.

"""Computational modeling of tumor invasion from limited and diverse data in Glioblastoma.""","""For diseases with high morbidity rates such as Glioblastoma Multiforme, the prognostic and treatment planning pipeline requires a comprehensive analysis of imaging, clinical, and molecular data. Many mutations have been shown to correlate strongly with the median survival rate and response to therapy of patients. Studies have demonstrated that these mutations manifest as specific visual biomarkers in tumor imaging modalities such as MRI. To minimize the number of invasive procedures on a patient and for the overall resource optimization for the prognostic and treatment planning process, the correlation of imaging and molecular features has garnered much interest. While the tumor mass is the most significant feature, the impacted tissue surrounding the tumor is also a significant biomarker contributing to the visual manifestation of mutations - which has not been studied as extensively. The pattern of tumor growth impacts the surrounding tissue accordingly, which is a reflection of tumor properties as well. Modeling how the tumor growth impacts the surrounding tissue can reveal important information about the patterns of tumor enhancement, which in turn has significant diagnostic and prognostic value. This paper presents the first work to automate the computational modeling of the impacted tissue surrounding the tumor using generative deep learning. The paper isolates and quantifies the impact of the Tumor Invasion (TI) on surrounding tissue based on change in mutation status, subsequently assessing its prognostic value. Furthermore, a TI Generative Adversarial Network (TI-GAN) is proposed to model the tumor invasion properties. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses, cross-dataset testing, and radiologist blind tests are carried out to demonstrate that TI-GAN can realistically model the tumor invasion under practical challenges of medical datasets such as limited data and high intra-class heterogeneity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39342741

The assays are versatile to characterize various aspects of GSCs, such as invasion, integration, and interaction with mature neurons of brain organoids. Tissue clearing and quantitative 3D imaging of GSCs in host organoids reveal that invasiveness is inversely correlated with the organoids' age. Importantly, the described invasion assays can distinguish the invasive behaviors of primary and recurrent GSCs. The assays are also amenable to test pharmacological agents.

While elastic hydrogels based on crosslinked low-molecular-weight (LMW) HA are widely exploited for this purpose and have proven valuable for discovery and screening, brain tissue is both viscoelastic and rich in high-MW (HMW) HA, and it remains unclear how these differences influence invasion. To address this question, hydrogels comprised of either HMW (1.5 MDa) or LMW (60 kDa) HA are introduced, characterized, and applied in GBM invasion studies. Unlike LMW HA hydrogels, HMW HA hydrogels relax stresses quickly, to a similar extent as brain tissue, and to a greater extent than many conventional HA-based scaffolds. GBM cells implanted within HMW HA hydrogels invade much more rapidly than in their LMW HA counterparts and exhibit distinct leader-follower dynamics. Leader cells adopt dendritic morphologies similar to invasive GBM cells observed in vivo. Transcriptomic, pharmacologic, and imaging studies suggest that leader cells exploit hyaluronidase, an enzyme strongly enriched in human GBMs, to prime a path for followers.

We and others have underlined the role played by cancer stem cells in gliomagenesis; the Cancer Genome Atlas Network has described most glioblastoma genetic alterations. Results: According to many studies, glioblastomas derive from malignant transformation of stem cells and/or glial precursor cells. Moreover, the topographic microenvironment is important regarding invasion and angiogenesis processes. Finally, it is now well established, thanks to IDH1 mutation identification, that primary and secondary glioblastomas are two different clinical and genetic entities. Interestingly, IDH1 mutation seems to be a very early genomic modification in astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and secondary glioblastoma tumorigenic processes.

This study explored the association between LVC and tumor origin and prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from 115 glioma patients were retrospectively reviewed, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the occurrence of LVC as a function of survival in 43 glioblastoma patients. The mRNA expression profiles were compared by microarray analysis in LV-contacting and non-LV-contacting glioblastomas (LVCGs and NLVCGs, respectively). The sphere-forming and invasive capabilities of LVCG- and NLVCG-derived stem cells were compared in primary glioma stem cell cultures with tumorsphere formation and Matrigel assays, respectively. LVC was more frequently detected in high-grade gliomas which, along with LVCGs, were significantly larger than low-grade gliomas and NLVCGs. LVC parameters were not independent predictors of glioblastoma patient prognosis; the expression profiles (including stemness genes expression) were similar between LVCGs and NLVCGs, and no significant differences were observed in tumorsphere-forming capacity and invasiveness between stem cells derived from the two glioblastoma types.

Whether GBM cells can trans-differentiate into non-neural cell types, including mural cells or endothelial cells (ECs), to support tumor growth and invasion remains controversial. Here we generated two genetic GBM models de novo in immunocompetent mouse brains, mimicking essential pathological and molecular features of human GBMs. Lineage-tracing and transplantation studies demonstrated that, although blood vessels in GBM brains underwent drastic remodeling, evidence of trans-differentiation of GBM cells into vascular cells was barely detected. Intriguingly, GBM cells could promiscuously express markers for mural cells during gliomagenesis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that patterns of copy number variations (CNVs) of mural cells and ECs were distinct from those of GBM cells, indicating discrete origins of GBM cells and vascular components. Importantly, single-cell CNV analysis of human GBM specimens also suggested that GBM cells and vascular cells are likely separate lineages. Rather than expansion owing to trans-differentiation, vascular cell expanded by proliferation during tumorigenesis. Therefore, cross-lineage trans-differentiation of GBM cells is very unlikely to occur during gliomagenesis.

However, only the astrocytes and T98G cells generated and maintained mature adhesive junctional domains to which LIN-7 was recruited. Alterations in the junctional domain of U373MG cells were associated with higher motility in a poly-L-lysine migration assay. When the T98G cells were cultured on Matrigel matrix, they acquired invasive properties but, despite unchanged cadherin adhesion system protein levels, the invasive T98G cell-cell contacts failed to accumulate LIN-7 and failed to mature.

Surgical resection of high grade brain tumors is rarely complete due to the highly infiltrative nature of glioblastoma cells. Therapeutic approaches which attenuate glioblastoma cell invasion therefore is an attractive option. Our laboratory and others have shown that tumor associated macrophages and microglia (resident brain macrophages) strongly stimulate glioblastoma invasion. The protocol described in this paper is used to model glioblastoma-macrophage/microglia interaction using in vitro culture assays. This approach can greatly facilitate the development and/or discovery of drugs that disrupt the communication with the macrophages that enables this malignant behavior. We have established two robust coculture invasion assays where microglia/macrophages stimulate glioma cell invasion by 5 - 10 fold. Glioblastoma cells labelled with a fluorescent marker or constitutively expressing a fluorescent protein are plated without and with macrophages/microglia on matrix-coated polycarbonate chamber inserts or embedded in a three dimensional matrix. Cell invasion is assessed by using fluorescent microscopy to image and count only invasive cells on the underside of the filter. Using these assays, several pharmacological inhibitors (JNJ-28312141, PLX3397, Gefitinib, and Semapimod), have been identified which block macrophage/microglia stimulated glioblastoma invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27805587
"""IL-33/ST2 axis promotes glioblastoma cell invasion by accumulating tenascin-C.""","""Tenascin-C (TNC), a very large multimeric glycoprotein, is overexpressed in human glioblastomas, leading to a highly motile and invasive phenotype of glioma cells. However, the regulation of TNC expression in glioma has remained unclear until now. Our data suggest that interleukin-33 (IL-33) may promote the accumulation of TNC protein by autocrine or paracrine modes of action in glioma. In the present study, the expression levels of TNC, IL-33, and ST2 were measured in glioma tissue specimens, and the impact of altered IL-33 expression on TNC was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In contrast with control treatment, IL-33 treatment increased TNC expression, and knockdown of IL-33 attenuated TNC expression in glioma cells. Furthermore, IL-33 induced the activation of nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and increased the expression of TNC in U251 cells. In addition, blockage of the IL-33-ST2-NFÎºB pathway resulted in downregulation of TNC production. IL-33 promoted glioma cell invasion by stimulating the secretion of TNC. Similarly, knockdown of TNC inhibited the invasiveness of glioma cells. These findings provide a novel perspective on the role of the IL-33/NF-ÎºB/TNC signalling pathway in supporting cancer progression. Thus, targeting the IL-33/NF-ÎºB/TNC signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach in glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31889095
"""Effect of Concomitant Radiochemotherapy on Invasion Potential of Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with inevitable recurrence after oncotherapy. The insufficient effect of 'gold standard' temozolomide-based concomitant radiochemotherapy may be due to the inability to prevent tumor cell invasion. Peritumoral infiltration depends mainly on the interaction between extracellular matrix (ECM) components and cell membrane receptors. Changes in invasive behaviour after oncotherapy can be evaluated at the molecular level by determining the RNA expression and protein levels of the invasion-related ECM components. The expression of nineteen ECM molecules was determined at both RNA and protein levels in thirty-one GBM samples. Fifteen GBM samples originated from the first surgical procedure on patients before oncotherapy, and sixteen GBM samples were collected at the second surgery due to local recurrence after concomitant chemoirradiation. RNA expressions were measured with qRT-PCR, and protein levels were determined by quantitative analysis of Western blots. Only MMP-9 RNA transcript level was reduced (p < 0.05) whereas at protein level, eight molecules showed changes concordant with RNA expression with significant decrease in brevican only. The results suggest that concomitant radiochemotherapy does not have sufficient impact on the expression of invasion-related ECM components of glioblastoma, oncotherapy does not significantly affect its invasive behavior. To avoid the spread of tumors into the brain parenchyma, supplementation of antiproliferative treatment with anti-invasive agents may be worth consideration in oncotherapy for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26450124
"""[Role of adrenomedullin in glioblastomas growth].""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant of the primary brain tumors and is almost always fatal. The treatment strategies for this disease have not changed appreciably for many years and most are based on a limited understanding of the biology of the disease. Growth factors are potential targets for therapeutic strategies because they are essential for tumor growth and progression. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional regulatory peptide with mitogenic and angiogenic capabilities among others. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that AM mRNA was correlated to the tumor type and grade, with high expression in all glioblastomas analysed, whereas a low expression was found in anaplastic astrocytomas and barely detectable levels in low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendriogliomas. The correlation of AM expression to the grade of glioma support the hypothesis that AM may participate in the progression of gliomas. We demonstrate that AM may function as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for glioblastoma cells. The data demonstrated that the anti-AM antibody significantly suppress the growth of established glioblastoma xenografts. The action of AM is specific and is mediated by the calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity-modifying protein-2 and -3 (CRLR/RAMP2, CRLR/RAMP3). Furthermore, the proangiogenic action of AM on cultured endothelial cells via CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 receptors may translate in vivo into enhanced neovascularization and therefore identify AM and its receptors acting as potential new targets for antiangiogenic therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15888388
"""Enhanced expression of pentraxin-3 in glioblastoma cells correlates with increased invasion and IL8-VEGF signaling axis.""","""Glioblastoma (GB) is highly invasive and resistant to multimodal treatment partly due to distorted vasculature and exacerbated inflammation. The aggressiveness of brain tumors may be attributed to the dysregulated release of angiogenic and inflammatory factors. The glycoprotein pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is correlated with the severity of some cancers. However, the mechanism responsible for the invasive oncogenic role of PTX3 in GB malignancy remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of PTX3 in GB growth, angiogenesis, and invasion using in vitro and in vivo GB models, proteomic profiling, molecular and biochemical approaches. Under in vitro conditions, PTX3 over-expression in U87 cells correlated with cell cycle progression, increased migratory potential, and proliferation under hypoxic conditions. Conditioned media containing PTX3 enhanced the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells. While silencing of PTX3 by siRNA decreased the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic potential of U87 cells in vitro. Importantly, PTX3 over-expression increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion in an orthotopic mouse model. Higher levels of PTX3 in these tumors were associated with the upregulation of inflammatory and angiogenic markers including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but decreased levels of thrombospondin-1, an anti-angiogenic factor. Mechanistically, exogenous production of PTX3 triggered an IKK/NFÎºB signaling pathway that enhances the expression of the motility genes AHGEF7 and Rac1. Taken together, PTX3 expression is dysregulated in GB. PTX3 may augment invasion through enhanced angiogenesis in the GB microenvironment through the IL8-VEGF axis. Thus, PTX3 may represent a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the aggressive behavior of gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906547
"""Targeted genomic CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies MAP4K4 as essential for glioblastoma invasion.""","""Among high-grade brain tumors, glioblastoma is particularly difficult to treat, in part due to its highly infiltrative nature which contributes to the malignant phenotype and high mortality in patients. In order to better understand the signaling pathways underlying glioblastoma invasion, we performed the first large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screen specifically designed to identify genes that facilitate cell invasion. We tested 4,574 genes predicted to be involved in trafficking and motility. Using a transwell invasion assay, we discovered 33 genes essential for invasion. Of the 11 genes we selected for secondary testing using a wound healing assay, 6 demonstrated a significant decrease in migration. The strongest regulator of invasion was mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAP4K4). Targeting of MAP4K4 with single guide RNAs or a MAP4K4 inhibitor reduced migration and invasion in vitro. This effect was consistent across three additional patient derived glioblastoma cell lines. Analysis of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in U138 cells with lack or inhibition of MAP4K4 demonstrated protein expression consistent with a non-invasive state. Importantly, MAP4K4 inhibition limited migration in a subset of human glioma organotypic slice cultures. Our results identify MAP4K4 as a novel potential therapeutic target to limit glioblastoma invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570734
"""MicroRNA-145 Promotes the Phenotype of Human Glioblastoma Cells Selected for Invasion.""","""Background/aim: Novel treatment strategies aiming to eliminate or attenuate the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, could offer a profound therapeutic benefit to patients. We previously demonstrated one method to create invasive sub-populations of GBM cells (IM3 cells) and a positive regulatory role for the miR-143/-145 locus in enhancing the invasion of GBM cells. Herein, we investigated the correlation between miR-145 and srGAP1 (SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein1) that is purported to be a target of miR-145 and involved in migration and invasion. Materials and methods: IM3 cells were created by a serial selection by using Boyden chambersÂ®. Antisense-miR-145 was transfected into IM3 cells by using lipofectamine 2000. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot were employed to analyze the expression of srGAP1. Results: The invasiveness of U87-IM3 and U251-IM3 is attenuated by transfection of antisense miR-145. In addition, srGAP1 was down-regulated in U87-IM3 and U251-IM3 cells compared to parental cells. Conclusion: The elevated miR-145 present in invasive glioblastoma cells (IM3 cells) targets and down-regulated srGAP1, thereby allowing downstream G-proteins to remain in their active state and promote the observed invasive phenotype.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26026080
"""Norepinephrine inhibits migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cell cultures possibly via MMP-11 inhibition.""","""Purpose: Growing evidence has shown that the stress hormones affect tumor progression. Patients with surgery to remove tumor often have increased norepinephrine during the perioperative period. However, the effect of norepinephrine on the progression of glioblastoma has not yet studied. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the effects of norepinephrine on the migration and invasion of the human glioblastoma U87 and U251 cell lines and the mechanism for the effects. Methods: The U87 and U251 cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 or 50 Î¼M norepinephrine. A scratch wound healing assay and a transwell invasion assay were used to investigate cell migration and invasion, respectively. The Human Tumor Metastasis RT2 Profiler PCR Array was used to detect the expression of 84 genes known to be involved in metastasis. Results: Following norepinephrine treatment, the ability of the U87 and U251 cells to migrate and invade was significantly decreased. Human Tumor Metastasis RT2 Profiler PCR Array assay showed that matrix metallopeptidase-11 (MMP-11) was decreased following norepinephrine treatment. The Î²-adrenergic receptor blocker (AR) propranolol blunted the suppressive effect of norepinephrine on the migration and invasion of U251 cells but did not have such an effect on the invasion of U87 cells. MMP-11 silencing inhibited the migration and invasion of U87 and U251 cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that patients with higher expression of MMP-11 in the glioblastoma tissues had poorer prognosis. Conclusion: Our results indicate that norepinephrine inhibits the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells. This effect may be mediated by the decrease of MMP-11. Î²-AR may be a regulatory factor for this effect in U251 cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33515535
"""Possible future issues in the treatment of glioblastomas: special emphasis on cell migration and the resistance of migrating glioblastoma cells to apoptosis.""","""Purpose: The present review aims to emphasize that malignant gliomas are characterized by the diffuse invasion of distant brain tissue by a myriad of single migrating cells that exhibit decreased levels of apoptosis (programmed cell death type I), thus a resistance to cytotoxic insult. Methods: The present review surveys the molecular mechanisms of migration in malignant gliomas and potential issues arising from treatments, in addition to relationships between glioma cell migration and resistance to apoptosis in terms of the molecular signaling pathways. Results: Clinical and experimental data demonstrate that glioma cell migration is a complex combination of multiple molecular processes, including the alteration of tumor cell adhesion to a modified extracellular matrix, the secretion of proteases by the cells, and modifications to the actin cytoskeleton. Intracellular signaling pathways involved in the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis by migrating glioma cells concern PI3K, Akt, mTOR, NF-kappaB, and autophagy (programmed cell death type II). Conclusion: A number of signaling pathways can be constitutively activated in migrating glioma cells, thus rendering these cells resistant to cytotoxic insults. However, these pathways are not all constitutively activated at the same time in any one glioma. Particular inhibitors should therefore only be chosen if the target is present in the tumor tissue, but this is only possible if individual patients are submitted to the molecular profiling of their tumors before undergoing any treatment to combat their migratory glioma cells. Specific antimigratory compounds should be added to conventional radio- and/or chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15800333
"""EZH2 Mediates Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Promoted by Estradiol in Human Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive brain tumors. 17Î²-estradiol (E2) increases proliferation, migration, and invasion of human GBM cells; however underlying mechanisms are no fully understood. Zeste 2 Enhancer Homologous enzyme (EZH2) is a methyltransferase part of Polycomb 2 repressor complex (PRC2). In GBM, EZH2 is overexpressed and involved in the cell cycle, migration, and invasion processes. We studied the role of EZH2 in the pro-oncogenic actions of E2 in human GBM cells. EZH2 gene silencing and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 blocked proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells induced by E2. We identified in silico additional putative estrogen response elements (EREs) at the EZH2 promoter, but E2 did not modify EZH2 expression. In silico analysis also revealed that among human GBM samples, EZH2 expression was homogeneous; in contrast, the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) allowed the classification of the samples into groups. Even in the GBM cluster with high expression of ERs and those of their target genes, the expression of PCR2 target genes did not change. Overall, our data suggest that in GBM cells, pro-oncogenic actions of E2 are mediated by EZH2, without changes in EZH2 expression and by mechanisms that appear to be unrelated to the transcriptional activity of ERs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35197928
"""Inhibitory effects of CAI in glioblastoma growth and invasion.""","""While distant metastases are rare in patients with primary brain malignancies, local growth and invasion are common and life-threatening. Regional infiltration is responsible for the failure of local therapies, resulting in tumor recurrence, progression, and death. The process of invasion requires cellular adhesion, local proteolysis and migration. CAI, carboxyamide-triazole, is an anticancer agent developed as an inhibitor of selected signal transduction pathways. Studies on the effects of CAI on human glioblastoma growth and invasiveness are presented. CAI inhibited proliferation of 6 of 8 cell lines tested in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro (IC50 range 1.5-44 microM), with no effect on the U373 line. Inhibition of adhesion to tissue culture plastic was observed for the H4, T98G, and U373 lines pretreated with CAI; H4 and T98G were inhibited in adhesion to collagen type IV. Incubation with CAI decreased production of the 72 kDa and 92 kDa type IV collagenases in all cell lines, ranging from 16 to 93% inhibition. These observations show that the effects of CAI on cell line behavior can vary between lines that are similar in origin. Despite variability in the inhibitory effects for proliferation and adhesion, CAI is consistently able to inhibit the invasive phenotype of all glioma cell lines in vitro using the Matrigel barrier assay (IC50 range 13-28 microM). These observations suggest that CAI may have benefit in the treatment of gliomas and high grade astrocytomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9120549
"""HCMV glycoprotein B is expressed in primary glioblastomas and enhances growth and invasiveness via PDGFR-alpha activation.""","""Our laboratory first demonstrated that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is associated with the most deadly form of primary brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). We showed that HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) mediates viral cellular entry via the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFR-alpha (PDGFRÎ±), resulting in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical signaling axis gliomagenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of gB overexpression on glioma progression. We demonstrate that gB is endogenously expressed in primary GBM samples and show that ectopic gB expression in glioma cells induced sustained phosphorylation of PDGFRÎ±, Akt, and Src. Recombinant gB protein and the whole virus enhanced invasion of primary glioblastoma cells into Matrigel and rat brain slices, and this effect was specifically inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to either gB or PDGFRÎ±. Importantly, neutralizing antibodies to gB significantly inhibited the invasiveness of patient-derived HCMV-positive glioblastoma cells, suggesting that functional inhibition of this viral protein could hinder glioblastoma progression. gB overexpression promoted in vivo glioma growth and enhanced phosphor-Akt levels and tumor cell dispersal relative to controls. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HCMV gB promotes key hallmarks of glioblastoma and suggest that targeting gB may have therapeutic benefits for patients with HCMV-positive gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24658280

"""Function of carbonic anhydrase IX in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX is over-expressed in glioblastoma; however, its functions in this context are unknown. Metabolically, glioblastomas are highly glycolytic, leading to a significant lactic acid load. Paradoxically, the intracellular pH is alkaline. We hypothesized that CAIX contributes to the extrusion of hydrogen ions into the extracellular space, thereby moderating intra- and extracellular pH and creating an environment conductive to enhanced invasion. We investigated the role of CAIX as a prognostic marker in patients with glioblastoma and its biological function in vitro. CAIX expression was analyzed in 59 patients with glioblastoma by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels were correlated to overall survival. In vitro, U251 and Ln 18 glioblastoma cells were incubated under hypoxia to induce CAIX expression, and RNA interference (RNAi) was used to examine the function of CAIX on cell attachment, invasion, intracellular energy transfer, and susceptibility to adjuvant treatment. High CAIX expression was identified as an independent factor for poor survival in patients with glioblastoma. In vitro, cell attachment and invasion were strongly reduced after knockdown of CAIX. Finally, the effects of radiation and chemotherapy were strongly augmented after CAIX interference and were accompanied by a higher rate of apoptotic cell death. CAIX is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome in patients with glioblastoma. Cell attachment, invasion, and survival during adjuvant treatment are significantly influenced by high CAIX expression. These results indicate that inhibition of CAIX is a potential metabolic target for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23074198
"""Sohlh1 suppresses glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and highly invasive type of astrocytic tumors. Despite advances in diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis and survival time remain poor. Identifying key mediators of tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion is crucial to the development of new and more effective therapies. In this paper, we report the novel role of Spermatogenesis- and oogenesis- specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor1 (Sohlh1) in the inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and aggressive behaviors in GBM cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of Sohlh1 and related proteins in astrocytomas. Human glioblastoma U87 and U251 cellswere transfected with appropriate plasmids and/or siRNAs to evaluate their functions on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Western blot and TOPflash luciferase assay were used to determine the involvement of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in Sohlh1-mediated cellular activities in glioblastomas. We observed that Sohlh1 was downregulated in astrocytomas. The reduction in Sohlh1 expression was inversely correlated with the degree of malignancy in astrocytomas. In GBM cell lines, cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion were significantly enhanced after Sohlh1 knockdown, but significantly inhibited after Sohlh1 overexpression. These functional effects of Sohlh1 were achieved by upregulating GSK3Î² and inhibiting Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights of Sohlh1 in malignant progression of astrocytomas, suggesting that the level of Sohlh1 expression may be a predictor of astrocytoma behavior and further, Sohlh1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29240260
"""Glioblastoma blood flow measured with stable xenon CT indicates tumor necrosis, vascularity, and brain invasion.""","""Tumor vasculature is a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma. Imaging tumor blood flow may help assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments. We determined the clinical usefulness of stable xenon CT performed preoperatively in patients with glioblastoma. This is a prospective cohort study. We determined absolute tumor blood flow before surgery in 38 patients with glioblastoma using stable xenon CT. We also histologically examined tumor specimens obtained from surgery and quantified their vascularity (by CD31 and CD105 immunostain), necrosis (by hematoxylin and eosin stain), and the presence of neuronal processes (by neurofilament immunostain). According to the xenon CT blood flow map, there are 3 types of glioblastoma. Type I glioblastomas have unimodal high blood flow histograms; histologically there is little necrosis and vascular proliferation. Type II glioblastomas have unimodal low blood flow histograms; histologically there is prominent necrosis and vascular proliferation. We propose that in type II glioblastoma, the abnormal vessels induced by hypoxia are inefficient at promoting blood flow. Type III glioblastomas have multimodal blood flow histograms. Histologically there is significant neuronal tissue within the tumor. Patients with type III glioblastomas were more likely to develop a post-surgical deficit, consistent with the inclusion of normal tissue within the tumor. Preoperative measurement of absolute blood flow with stable xenon CT in patients with glioblastoma predicts key biological features of the tumor and may aid surgical planning.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22492958
"""Role of a DNA damage checkpoint pathway in ionizing radiation-induced glioblastoma cell migration and invasion.""","""Ionizing radiation (IR) induces a DNA damage response that includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, leading to cell cycle arrest. In addition, IR enhances cell invasiveness of glioblastoma cells, among other tumor cell types. Using RNA interference, we found that the protein kinase MRK, previously implicated in the DNA damage response to IR, also inhibits IR-induced cell migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells. We showed that MRK activation by IR requires the checkpoint protein Nbs1 and that Nbs1 is also required for IR-stimulated migration. In addition, we show that MRK acts upstream of Chk2 and that Chk2 is also required for IR-stimulated migration and invasion. Thus, we have identified Nbs1, MRK, and Chk2 as elements of a novel signaling pathway that mediates IR-stimulated cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of cell cycle progression, either with the CDK1/2 inhibitor CGP74514A or by downregulation of the CDC25A protein phosphatase, restores IR-induced migration and invasion in cells depleted of MRK or Chk2. These data indicate that cell cycle progression, at least in the context of IR, exerts a negative control on the invasive properties of glioblastoma cells and that checkpoint proteins mediate IR-induced invasive behavior by controlling cell cycle arrest.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22552889

Recent studies have demonstrated an oncogenic role of TRIM 14 in multiple human cancers; however, the importance of this protein in glioblastoma remains to be elucidated. Methods: The expression levels of TRIM14 were analyzed in a series of database and were examined in a variety of glioblastoma cell lines. Two independent TRIM14 shRNA were transfected into LN229 and U251 cells, and the effect of TRIM14 depletion was confirmed. Transwell assay and wound healing assay assay were carried out to assess the effect of TRIM14 depletion on glioblastoma cell invasion and migration. Western blotting was performed to screen the downstream gene of TRIM14. The stability analysis and Ubiquitylation assays and Orthotopic xenograft studies were also performed to investigate the role of TRIM14 and the relationship with downstream gene. Human glioblastoma tissues were obtained and immunohistochemical staining were carried out to confirm the clinical significance of TRIM14. Results: In this study, we showed that TRIM14 was upregulated in human glioblastoma specimens and cell lines, and correlated with glioblastoma progression and shorter patient survival times. Functional experiments showed that decreased TRIM14 expression reduced glioblastoma cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, we identified that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is a downstream target of TRIM14. Further investigation revealed that TRIM14 inactivation significantly facilitated ZEB2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which led to aggressive invasion and migration.

"""The Invasion Factor ODZ1 Is Upregulated through an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Induced Pathway in Primary Glioblastoma Cells.""","""We have previously shown that the transmembrane protein ODZ1 promotes cytoskeletal remodeling of glioblastoma (GBM) cells and invasion of the surrounding parenchyma through the activation of a RhoA-ROCK pathway. We also described that GBM cells can control the expression of ODZ1 through transcriptional mechanisms triggered by the binding of IL-6 to its receptor and a hypoxic environment. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a key role in the invasive capacity of GBM. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable tumor cells to acquire the morphological changes to migrate out from the tumor core have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that EGF is able to induce the expression of ODZ1 in primary GBM cells. We analyzed the levels of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in 20 GBM primary cell lines and found expression in 19 of them by flow cytometry. We selected two cell lines that do or do not express the EGFR and found that EGFR-expressing cells responded to the EGF ligand by increasing ODZ1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, blockade of EGF-EGFR binding by Cetuximab, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway, or Additionally, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAPK11 (p38Î² MAPK) reduced the induction of ODZ1 in response to EGF. Overall, we show that EGF may activate an EGFR-mediated signaling pathway through p38Î² MAPK, to upregulate the invasion factor ODZ1, which may initiate morphological changes for tumor cells to invade the surrounding parenchyma.

Apoptotic activity of SA was shown by DAPI staining, caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 mRNA expressions. The cell cycle regulation was also confirmed by reducing the mRNA expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, and CDK6.

Our goal is to identify CDKN2A specific qualitative imaging biomarkers in glioblastomas using a new informatics workflow that enables rapid analysis of qualitative imaging features with Visually AcceSAble Rembrandtr Images (VASARI) for large datasets in PACS. Sixty nine patients undergoing GBM resection with CDKN2A status determined by whole-exome sequencing were included. GBMs on magnetic resonance images were automatically 3D segmented using deep learning algorithms incorporated within PACS. VASARI features were assessed using FHIR forms integrated within PACS. GBMs without CDKN2A alterations were significantly larger (64 vs. 30%, p = 0.007) compared to tumors with homozygous deletion (HOMDEL) and heterozygous loss (HETLOSS). Lesions larger than 8 cm were four times more likely to have no CDKN2A alteration (OR: 4.3; 95% CI 1.5-12.1; p < 0.001). We developed a novel integrated PACS informatics platform for the assessment of GBM molecular subtypes and show that tumors with HOMDEL are more likely to have radiographic evidence of pial invasion and less likely to have deep white matter invasion or subependymal invasion.

Cells were plated on polyacrylamide gels of defined rigidity that reflect the diversity of the brain tissue mechanical environment, and cell morphology and migration were analysed by time-lapse microscopy. Invasiveness was assessed in multicellular spheroids embedded in 3D matrigel cultures. Our data reveal a range of rigidity-dependent responses between the patient-derived cell lines, from reduced migration on the most compliant tissue stiffness to those that are insensitive to substrate rigidity and are equally migratory irrespective of the underlying substrate stiffness.

"""Inhibition of glioblastoma tumorspheres by combined treatment with 2-deoxyglucose and metformin.""","""Background: Deprivation of tumor bioenergetics by inhibition of multiple energy pathways has been suggested as an effective therapeutic approach for various human tumors. However, this idea has not been evaluated in glioblastoma (GBM). We hypothesized that dual inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation could effectively suppress GBM tumorspheres (TS). Methods: Effects of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and metformin, alone and in combination, on GBM-TS were evaluated. Viability, cellular energy metabolism status, stemness, invasive properties, and GBM-TS transcriptomes were examined. In vivo efficacy was tested in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Results: GBM-TS viability was decreased by the combination of 2DG and metformin. ATP assay and PET showed that cellular energy metabolism was also decreased by this combination. Sphere formation, expression of stemness-related proteins, and invasive capacity of GBM-TS were also significantly suppressed by combined treatment with 2DG and metformin. A transcriptome analysis showed that the expression levels of stemness- and epithelial mesenchymal transition-related genes were also significantly downregulated by combination of 2DG and metformin. Combination treatment also prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice and decreased invasiveness of GBM-TS. Conclusion: The combination of 2DG and metformin effectively decreased the stemness and invasive properties of GBM-TS and showed a potential survival benefit in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Our findings suggest that targeting TS-forming cells by this dual inhibition of cellular bioenergetics warrants expedited clinical evaluation for the treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27571886
"""Histology of human glioblastoma transplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane.""","""Glioblastoma is the most malignant tumor in the range of cerebral astrocytic gliomas. A lot of experimental models are used to evaluate various properties of glioblastoma. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane model is one of them. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate histology and survival of glioblastoma tumors taken immediately from operating theatre and transplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Glioblastoma samples obtained from 10 patients were transplanted onto 200 eggs. Overall, we used 15 tumors; only 5 of them were not glioblastomas as it was revealed later. RESULTS. The transplanted tumors survive up to 6 days. Transplants do not survive longer because during embryo's development the nourishing membrane dries. Transplanted glioblastomas exhibited the same features as original glioblastomas - necrosis, endothelium proliferation, cellular polymorphism - while transplanted glioblastomas also showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, Ki67, S100 protein, neurofilament immunoreactivity, and infiltration of macrophages (CD68) and T cells (CD3(+), CD8(+)). Transplanted glioblastomas did not show any immunoreactivity of p53. Invasion of vessels from the chicken into transplanted tumor is not observed. Chicken erythrocytes did not appear within the transplants, and tumor cells invade chicken tissue at the minimum. CONCLUSION. Our data show that transplanted pieces of glioblastoma survive with all cytological features. The presence of macrophages (marker CD68) and T cells (markers CD3(+) and CD8(+)) can be registered in the transplant. The data revealed that transplanted glioblastoma remains as insulated unit, which survives from nourishment of the chorioallantoic membrane apparently only by diffusion.

Biological 3D tumor spheroid models can serve as intermediate systems between traditional 2D cell culture and complex in vivo models. Tumor spheroids have been shown to more accurately reproduce the spatial organization and microenvironmental factors of in vivo micro-tumors, such as relevant gradients of nutrients and other molecular agents, while they maintain cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. In vitro 3D assays are useful to monitor these properties. Here, we test the suitability of the well-known T98 G Glioblastoma cell line in such a 3D assay. The doubling time and death rate parameters of T98 G are estimated, as well as their spheroidal growth-expansion curves with and without the presence of basement membrane substrate. The T98 G invasive profile is characterized by collective morphology and proliferation-associated invasion.

The hallmark of GBMs is their highly infiltrative nature. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive cancer invasion in GBMs are poorly understood. GBM displays remarkable cellular heterogeneity and hierarchy containing self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Whether GSCs are more invasive than non-stem tumor cells and contribute to the invasive phenotype in GBMs has not been determined. Here we provide experimental evidence supporting that GSCs derived from GBM surgical specimens or xenografts display greater invasive potential in vitro and in vivo than matched non-stem tumor cells. Furthermore, we identified several invasion-associated proteins that were differentially expressed in GSCs relative to non-stem tumor cells. One of such proteins is L1CAM, a cell surface molecule shown to be critical to maintain GSC tumorigenic potential in our previous study. Immunohistochemical staining showed that L1CAM is highly expressed in a population of cancer cells in the invasive fronts of primary GBMs. Collectively, these data demonstrate the invasive nature of GSCs, suggesting that disrupting GSCs through a specific target such as L1CAM may reduce GBM cancer invasion and tumor recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21371437

We generated cell lines from glioblastoma specimens with the goal to obtain model systems for glioma stem cell biology. Unsupervised analysis of the expression profiles of nine cell lines established under neural stem cell conditions yielded two distinct clusters. Four cell lines were characterized by the expression of neurodevelopmental genes. They showed a multipotent differentiation profile along neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages, grew spherically in vitro, expressed CD133 and formed highly invasive tumors in vivo. The other five cell lines shared expression signatures enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes, had a more restricted differentiation capacity, contained no or fewer CD133+ cells, grew semiadherent or adherent in vitro and displayed reduced tumorigenicity and invasion in vivo. Our findings show that stable, multipotent glioblastoma cell lines with a full stem-like phenotype express neurodevelopmental genes as a distinctive feature, which may offer therapeutic targeting opportunities. The generation of another distinct cluster of cell lines showing similarly homogeneous profiling but restricted stem cell properties suggests that different phenotypes exist, each of which may lead to the typical appearance of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18037961

However, the invasion zone is difficult to visualize by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and is protected by the blood brain barrier, posing a particular challenge for treatment. We report biological features of invasive growth accompanying tumor progression and invasion based on associated metabolic and transcriptomic changes observed in patient derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) in the mouse and the corresponding patients' tumors. The evolution of metabolic changes, followed in vivo longitudinally by 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) at ultra-high field, reflected growth and the invasive properties of the human glioblastoma transplanted into the brains of mice (PDOX). Comparison of MRS derived metabolite signatures, reflecting temporal changes of tumor development and invasion in PDOX, revealed high similarity to spatial metabolite signatures of combined multi-voxel MRS analyses sampled across different areas of the patients' tumors. Pathway analyses of the transcriptome associated with the metabolite profiles of the PDOX, identified molecular signatures of invasion, comprising extracellular matrix degradation and reorganization, growth factor binding, and vascular remodeling. Specific analysis of expression signatures from the invaded mouse brain, revealed extent of invasion dependent induction of immune response, recapitulating respective signatures observed in glioblastoma. Integrating metabolic profiles and gene expression of highly invasive PDOX provided insights into progression and invasion associated mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling that is essential for cell-cell communication and regulation of cellular processes. Structural changes and biochemical properties of the extracellular matrix are of importance for the biological behavior of tumors and may be druggable.

"""Overexpression of TIMP-1 and Sensitivity to Topoisomerase Inhibitors in Glioblastoma Cell Lines.""","""The multifunctional protein - tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) - has been associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancers including glioblastomas. In addition, TIMP-1 has been associated with decreased response to chemotherapy, and especially the efficacy of the family of topoisomerase (TOP) inhibitors has been related to TIMP-1. As a second line treatment of glioblastomas, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab is administered in combination with the TOP1 inhibitor irinotecan and glioblastoma cell levels of TIMP-1 could therefore potentially influence the efficacy of such treatment. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether a high TIMP-1 expression in glioblastoma cell lines would affect the sensitivity to TOP inhibitors, and whether TIMP-1 overexpressing cells would have alterered growth and invasion. We established TIMP-1 overexpressing subclones from two human glioblastoma cell lines. TIMP-1 overexpressing U87MG cells were significantly more resistant than low TIMP-1 expressing clones and parental cells when exposed to SN-38 (TOP1 inhibitor) or epirubicin (TOP2 inhibitor). No significant differences were observed for the TIMP-1 transfected A172 cells. Implantation of both U87MG and A172 spheroids into organotypic brain slice cultures revealed a reduced growth of TIMP-1 overexpressing U87MG spheroids, however, no significant differences in invasion were observed. The present study suggests that TIMP-1 overexpression reduces the effect of TOP inhibitors in glioblastoma. TIMP-1 also appeared to reduce spheroid growth, but did not influence invasion. Whether TIMP-1 plays a role in irinotecan resistance and has a predictive potential in glioblastoma patients remains to be elucidated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28963609

We used a comprehensive data-driven network modeling technique (augmented sparse inverse covariance selection, aSICS) to define separate genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptional regulators of glioblastoma subtypes. Our model identified Annexin A2 (ANXA2) as a novel methylation-controlled positive regulator of the mesenchymal subtype. Subsequent evaluation in two independent cohorts established ANXA2 expression as a prognostic factor that is dependent on ANXA2 promoter methylation. ANXA2 knockdown in primary glioblastoma stem cell-like cultures suppressed known mesenchymal master regulators, and abrogated cell proliferation and invasion.

"""Induction of apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppression of ERK/NF-kappaB signalling participate in anti-glioblastoma of imipramine.""","""Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of brain tumour, with poor prognosis even after standard treatment such as surgical resection, temozolomide and radiation therapy. The overexpression of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB) in glioblastomas is recognized as an important treatment target. Thus, an urgent need regarding glioblastomas is the development of a new, suitable agent that may show potential for the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/NF-ÎºB-mediated glioblastoma progression. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has anti-inflammatory actions against inflamed glial cells; additionally, imipramine can induce glioblastoma toxicity via the activation of autophagy. However, whether imipramine can suppress glioblastoma progression via the induction of apoptosis and blockage of ERK/NF-ÎºB signalling remains unclear. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of imipramine on apoptotic signalling and ERK/NF-ÎºB-mediated glioblastoma progression by using cell proliferation (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT] assay), flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cell invasion/migration assay analysis in vitro. The ERK and NF-ÎºB inhibitory capacity of imipramine is detected by NF-ÎºB reporter gene assay and Western blotting. Additionally, a glioblastoma-bearing animal model was used to validate the therapeutic efficacy and general toxicity of imipramine. Our results demonstrated that imipramine successfully triggered apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppressed the invasion/migration ability of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, imipramine effectively suppressed glioblastoma progression in vivo via the inhibition of the ERK/NF-ÎºB pathway. In summary, imipramine is a potential anti-glioblastoma drug which induces apoptosis and has the capacity to inhibit ERK/NF-ÎºB signalling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149465

"""The effects of ephrinB2 signaling on proliferation and invasion in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The aggressive nature of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) may be attributed to the dysregulation of pathways driving both proliferation and invasion. EphrinB2, a membrane-bound ligand for some of the Eph receptors, has emerged as a critical target regulating these pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of ephrinB2 in regulating proliferation and invasion in GBM using intracranial and subcutaneous xenograft models. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis suggested high transcript and low methylation levels of ephrinB2 as poor prognostic indicators in GBM, consistent with its role as an oncogene. EphrinB2 knockdown, however, increased tumor growth, an effect that was reversed by ephrinB2 Fc protein. This was associated with EphB4 receptor activation, consistent with the data showing a significant decrease in tumor growth with ephrinB2 overexpression. Mechanistic analyses showed that ephrinB2 knockdown has anti-invasive but pro-proliferative effects in GBM. EphB4 stimulation following ephrinB2 Fc treatment in ephrinB2 knockdown tumors was shown to impart strong anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects, which correlated with decrease in PCNA, p-ERK, vimentin, Snail, Fak, and increase in the E-cadherin levels.

Focusing on this invasive nature, we investigated whether ganglioside-specific sialidase NEU3 might be involved, because gangliosides are major components of brain tissues, and cell surface sialic acids, as target residues of sialidase catalysis, are thought to be closely related to cell invasion. Methods: NEU3 mRNA levels of human glioblastoma specimens were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Human glioblastoma cell lines, U251, A172, and T98G were used for cell invasion and migration by transwell and cell scratching assay. The molecules involved in the signaling cascade were investigated by western blot and immunofluorescent microscopy. Results: NEU3 expression was down-regulated in human glioblastoma specimens. In the human glioblastoma cell lines, NEU3 overexpression reduced invasion and migration by promoting the assembly of focal adhesions through reduced calpain-dependent proteolysis, but NEU3 silencing resulted in accelerating cell invasion via disassembly of focal adhesions. In NEU3-silenced cells, elevation of calpain activity and GM3 accumulation were observed, as results of reduced sialidase hydrolysis, localization of calpain and GM3 at the cell lamellipodium being demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Conclusion: Sialidase NEU3 was found to exert a great influence on cell invasion in regulation of calpain activity and focal adhesion disassembly and consequent invasive potential of glioblastoma cells.

Its invasive nature limits treatment efficacy and promotes inevitable recurrence. Previous in vitro studies showed that interstitial fluid flow, a factor characteristically increased in cancer, increases glioma cell invasion through CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling. It is currently unknown if these effects translate in vivo. We used the therapeutic technique of convection enhanced delivery (CED) to test if convective flow alters glioma invasion in a syngeneic GL261 mouse model of glioblastoma. The GL261 cell line was flow responsive in vitro, dependent upon CXCR4 and CXCL12. Additionally, transplanting GL261 intracranially increased the populations of CXCR4+ and double positive cells versus 3D culture. We showed that inducing convective flow within implanted tumors indeed increased invasion over untreated controls, and administering the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (5 mg/kg) effectively eliminated this response. These data confirm that glioma invasion is stimulated by convective flow in vivo and depends on CXCR4 signaling. We also showed that expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 is increased in patients having received standard therapy, when CED might be elected. Hence, targeting flow-stimulated invasion may prove beneficial as a second line of therapy, particularly in patients chosen to receive treatment by convection enhanced delivery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30451884

Over the last two decades, the field of Mathematical Neuro-oncology has grown out of desire to use (often patient-specific) mathematical modeling to better treat GBMs. Here, we will focus on a series of clinically relevant results using patient-specific mathematical modeling. The core model at the center of these results incorporates two hallmark features of GBM, proliferation [Formula: see text] and invasion (D), as key parameters.

"""TROY (TNFRSF19) promotes glioblastoma survival signaling and therapeutic resistance.""","""Of the features that characterize glioblastoma, arguably none is more clinically relevant than the propensity of malignant glioma cells to aggressively invade into the surrounding normal brain tissue. These invasive cells render complete resection impossible, confer significant resistance to chemo- and radiation-therapy, and virtually assure tumor recurrence. Expression of TROY (TNFRSF19), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, inversely correlates with patient survival and stimulates glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in vitro. In this study, we report that TROY is overexpressed in glioblastoma tumor specimens and TROY mRNA expression is increased in the invasive cell population in vivo. In addition, inappropriate expression of TROY in mouse astrocytes in vivo using glial-specific gene transfer in transgenic mice induces astrocyte migration within the brain, validating the importance of the TROY signaling cascade in glioblastoma cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of TROY expression in primary glioblastoma xenografts significantly prolonged survival in vivo. Moreover, TROY expression significantly increased resistance of glioblastoma cells to both IR- and TMZ-induced apoptosis via activation of Akt and NF-ÎºB. Inhibition of either Akt or NF-ÎºB activity suppressed the survival benefits of TROY signaling in response to TMZ treatment. These findings position aberrant expression and/or signaling by TROY as a contributor to the dispersion of glioblastoma cells and therapeutic resistance.

Glycocalyx thickness modulates integrins mechanosensing, but details remain elusive and glycosylation enzymes involved are unknown. Here, we studied the association between matrix stiffness modulation, GSC migration and MGAT5 induced N-glycosylation in fibrillar 3D context. Method: To mimic the extracellular matrix fibrillar microenvironments, we designed 3D-ex-polyacrylonitrile nanofibers scaffolds (NFS) with adjustable stiffnesses by loading multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). GSCs neurosphere were plated on NFSs, allowing GSCs migration and MGAT5 was deleted using CRISPR-Cas9. Results: We found that migration of GSCs was maximum at 166 kPa. Migration rate was correlated with cell shape, expression and maturation of focal adhesion (FA), Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) proteins and (Î²1,6) branched N-glycan binding, galectin-3.

Here, EVs secreted by six GBM cell lines were isolated and analysed by quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry. Overall, 844 proteins were identified in the GBM EV proteome, of which 145 proteins were common to EVs secreted by all cell lines examined; included in the curated EV compendium (Vesiclepedia_559; http://microvesicles.org ). Levels of 14 EV proteins significantly correlated with cell invasion (invadopodia production; r2 > 0.5, p < 0.05), including several proteins that interact with molecules responsible for regulating invadopodia formation. Invadopodia, actin-rich membrane protrusions with proteolytic activity, are associated with more aggressive disease and are sites of EV release. Gene levels corresponding to invasion-related EV proteins showed that five genes (annexin A1, actin-related protein 3, integrin-Î²1, insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor and programmed cell death 6-interacting protein) were significantly higher in GBM tumours compared to normal brain in silico, with common functions relating to actin polymerisation and endosomal sorting.

In the central nervous system, VIP and PACAP are involved in neurogenesis, cell differentiation and migration, suggesting that they could be implicated in the development of glioblastoma (GBM). The infiltrative nature of GBM remains a major problem for the therapy of these tumors. We previously demonstrated that the VIP-receptor system regulated cell migration of the human cell lines M059J and M059K, derived from a single human GBM. Here, we evaluated the involvement of the VIP-receptor system in GBM cell invasion. In Matrigel invasion assays, M059K cells that express more the VIP-receptor system than M059J cells were less invasive. Invasion assays performed in the presence of agonists, antagonists or anti-PACAP antibodies as well as experiments with transfected M059J cells overexpressing the VPAC1 receptor indicated that the more the VIP-receptor system was expressed and activated, the less the cells were able to invade. Western immunoblotting experiments revealed that the VIP-receptor system inactivated the signaling protein AKT. Invasion assays carried out in the presence of an AKT inhibitor demonstrated the involvement of this signaling kinase in the regulation of cell invasion by the VIP-receptor system in M059K cells. The inhibition by VIP of invasion and AKT was also observed in U87 cells.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSLC) contribute to glioblastoma invasiveness and repopulation; hence, they represent promising targets for novel therapies. BAL101553 is a prodrug of BAL27862, a novel microtubule-destabilizing agent inhibiting tumor cell proliferation through activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is currently in phase I/II clinical development. Broad anticancer activity has been demonstrated against human cancer models, including tumors refractory to conventional treatments. We have shown that overexpression of microtubule + end-binding 1-protein (EB1) correlates with glioblastoma progression and poor survival. Here, we show that BAL27862 inhibits the growth of two glioblastoma CSLCs. As EB1 is overexpressed in the CSLC line GBM6, which displays a high tumorigenicity and infiltrative pattern of migration in vivo, we investigated drug activity on GBM6 according to EB1 expression. BAL27862 inhibited migration and colony formation at subcytotoxic concentrations in EB1-expressing control cells (GBM6-sh0) but only at cytotoxic concentrations in EB1-downregulated (GBM-shE1) cells. Three administrations of BAL101553 were sufficient to provoke an EB1-dependent survival benefit in tumor-bearing mice. Patterns of invasion and quantification of tumor cells in brain demonstrated that GBM6-sh0 cells were more invasive than GBM6-shEB1 cells, and that the antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of BAL101553 were more potent in mice bearing control tumors than in EB1-downregulated tumors.

"""Cucurbitacin B induces inhibitory effects via CIP2A/PP2A/Akt pathway in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a human oncoprotein that is overexpressed in multiple types of tumors and promotes the proliferation and transformation of cancer cells. However, whether CIP2A can be a new drug target for human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is largely unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the overexpression of CIP2A promotes invasive behavior in GBM, and a natural compound, cucurbitacin B (CuB), shows an anti-proliferative and anti-invasion effect in GBM cell lines. CuB effectively induces apoptosis, downregulates CIP2A expression and its downstream signaling molecule, phospho-Akt, and upregulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. Overexpression of CIP2A reduced CuB-inhibited growth and invasion in GBM cells. Silencing CIP2A enhanced CuB-induced invasion inhibition and apoptosis in GBM. CuB combined with cisplatin synergistically inhibited GBM cells. CuB also inhibited tumor growth in murine models. Western blot results further revealed that CuB downregulates CIP2A, and phospho-Akt in vivo. In summary, inhibition of CIP2A determines the effects of CuB-induced invasive behavior inhibition and apoptosis in GBM cells. These characteristics render CuB as a promising candidate drug for further development and for designing new effective CIP2A inhibitors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29393542
"""The influence of biomechanical properties and cannabinoids on tumor invasion.""","""Background: Cannabinoids are known to have an anti-tumorous effect, but the underlying mechanisms are only sparsely understood. Mechanical characteristics of tumor cells represent a promising marker to distinguish between tumor cells and the healthy tissue. We tested the hypothesis whether cannabinoids influence the tumor cell specific mechanical and migratory properties and if these factors are a prognostic marker for the invasiveness of tumor cells. Methods: 3 different glioblastoma cell lines were treated with cannabinoids and changes of mechanical and migratory properties of single cells were measured using atomic force microscopy and time lapse imaging. The invasiveness of cell lines was determined using a co-culture model with organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Results: We found that cannabinoids are capable of influencing migratory and mechanical properties in a cell line specific manner. A network analysis revealed a correlation between a 'generalized stiffness' and the invasiveness for all tumor cell lines after 3 and 4 d of invasion time: r3d = -0.88 [-0.52;-0.97]; r4d = -0.90 [-0.59;-0.98]. Conclusions: Here we could show that a 'generalized stiffness' is a profound marker for the invasiveness of a tumor cell population in our model and thus might be of high clinical relevance for drug testing.

"""Single-cell RNA-seq reveals the invasive trajectory and molecular cascades underlying glioblastoma progression.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, in which GBM stem cells (GSCs) were identified to contribute to aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Yet, how GSCs progress to invasive cells remains largely unexplored. Here, we revealed the cell subpopulations with distinct functional status and the existence of cells with high invasive potential within heterogeneous primary GBM tumors. We reconstructed a branched trajectory by pseudotemporal ordering of single tumor cells, in which the root showed GSC-like phenotype while the end displayed high invasive activity. Thus, we further determined a path along which GSCs gradually transformed to invasive cells, called the 'stem-to-invasion path'. Along this path, cells showed incremental expression of GBM invasion-associated signatures and diminishing expression of GBM stem cell markers. These findings were validated in an independent single-cell data set of GBM. Through analyzing the molecular cascades underlying the path, we identify crucial factors controlling the attainment of invasive potential of tumor cells, including transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs.

"""Overview of the molecular mechanisms of migration and invasion in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most devastating cancers, with an approximate median survival of only 16 months. Although some new insights into the fantastic heterogeneity of this kind of brain tumor have been revealed in recent studies, all subclasses of GBM still demonstrate highly aggressive invasion properties to the surrounding parenchyma. This behavior has become the main obstruction to current curative therapies as invasive GBM cells migrate away from these foci after surgical therapies. Therefore, this review aimed to provide a relatively comprehensive study of GBM invasion mechanisms, which contains an intricate network of interactions and signaling pathways with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among these related molecules, TGF-Î², the ECM, Akt, and microRNAs are most significant in terms of cellular procedures related to GBM motility and invasion. Moreover, we also review data indicating that Musashi-1 (MSI1), a neural RNA-binding protein (RBP), regulates GBM motility and invasion, maintains stem cell populations in GBM, and promotes drug-resistant GBM phenotypes by stimulating necessary oncogenic signaling pathways through binding and regulating mRNA stability. Importantly, these necessary oncogenic signaling pathways have a close connection with TGF-Î², ECM, and Akt. Thus, it appears promising to find MSI-specific inhibitors or RNA interference-based treatments to prevent the actions of these molecules despite using RBPs, which are known as hard therapeutic targets. In summary, this review aims to provide a better understanding of these signaling pathways to help in developing novel therapeutic approaches with better outcomes in preclinical studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34029218

Although some progress has been made, the impact of recent advances in multimodality therapies on clinical outcome has been disappointing, with a median survival of less than 15 months. A major challenge in patients with glioblastomas is the propensity of the tumor to invade into adjacent brain tissue. Invasive tumor cells escape surgical removal and, because of their reduced proliferation rate and increased resistance to apoptosis, they are relatively resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Recently, there has been important progress in understanding the molecular determinants of glioma invasion and migration.

"""Significantly higher expression of high-mobility group AT hook protein 2 (HMGA2) in the border zone of glioblastoma.""","""Background: High-mobility group AT-hook protein 2 (HMGA2) is a gene regulatory protein that is correlated with metastatic potential and poor prognosis. It has been shown that HMGA2 is overexpressed in various tumors such as lung cancer or pancreatic cancer. The invasive character and highly aggressive structure of glioblastoma let us to investigate HMGA2 expression in the border zone of the tumor more closely. We compared HMGA2 expression between glioblastoma and normal brain tissue. In addition, we analyzed and compared HMGA2 expression in the border and center zones of tumors. Correlation tests between HMGA expression and clinical parameters such as MGMT-status and survival were performed. Methods: Samples from 23 patients with WHO grade 4 glioblastomas were analyzed for HMGA2 expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated with clinical parameters. The areas from the tumor center and border were analyzed separately. Two normal brain tissue specimens were used as the controls. Results: Our results confirm that HMGA2 is higher expressed in glioblastoma compared to healthy brain tissue (qPCR, P=0.013; IHC, P=0.04). Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher HMGA2 expression in the border zone of the tumor than in the tumor center zone (P=0.012). Survival analysis revealed a tendency for shorter survival when HMGA2 was highly expressed in the border zone. Conclusions: The results reveal an overexpression of HMGA2 in the border zone of glioblastomas; thus, the expression cluster of HMGA2 seems to be heterogenous and thorough borough surgical resection of the vital and aggressive border cells might be important to inhibit the invasive character of the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36987772
"""MicroRNA-195 plays a tumor-suppressor role in human glioblastoma cells by targeting signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation and invasion.""","""Accumulating evidence has implicated the deregluation of miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Previous studies have reported that microRNA-195 (miR-195) is markedly down-regulated in human glioblastoma cells, compared with normal brain tissue, but the biological role of miR-195 in glioblastoma development is currently unknown. In this study, we define a tumor-suppressor role for miR-195 in human glioblastoma cells. Over-expression of miR-195 in glioblastoma cell lines robustly arrested cell cycle progression and significantly repressed cellular invasion. We identified E2F3 and CCND3 as functional downstream targets of miR-195 in glioblastoma cells. Through knockdown studies, we demonstrated that E2F3 was the dominant effector of miR-195-mediated cell cycle arrest and that CCND3 was a key mediator of miR-195-induced inhibition of glioblastoma cell invasion. Furthermore, we showed that p27(Kip1) was an important regulator downstream of CCND3 and that the accumulation of p27(Kip1) in the cytoplasm might be responsible for the miR-195-mediated cell invasion inhibition in glioblastoma cells. This work provides evidence for the initial mechanism by which miR-195 negatively regulates both the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma cells, suggesting that the down-regulation of miR-195 might contribute to the malignant transformation of glioblastoma cells and could be a molecular signature associated with glioblastoma progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22217655

To investigate the role of cystatin C in the invasion of brain tumor cells, we stably transfected SNB19 glioblastoma cells with either a 0.4-kb cDNA construct of human cystatin C in the sense orientation or an empty vector. Clones expressing sense-cystatin C cDNA had higher cystatin C mRNA and protein levels than did control cells. Sense-transfected cells were also markedly less invasive than control cells in a Matrigel invasion assay and in a coculture assay of SNB19 spheroids and fetal rat brain aggregates. Finally, the sense-transfected cells did not form tumors in nude mice upon intracerebral injection.

In this study, we found that MUC4 was overexpressed in GBM cell lines and tissues. The proliferation and invasive potential of GBM cells were significantly increased by the ectopic expression of MUC4. By contrast, RNA interference targeting MUC4 in GBM cells significantly decreased the proliferation and invasive potential of GBM cells. We also found that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was modulated by MUC4. EGFR inhibition by siRNA reversed the MUC4-induced proliferation and invasion.

Confounding the clinical management of glioblastomas is the extreme local invasiveness of these cancer cells. The mechanisms that govern invasion are poorly understood. To gain insight into glioblastoma invasion, we conducted experiments on the patterns of growth and dispersion of U87 glioblastoma tumor spheroids in a three-dimensional collagen gel. We studied two different cell lines, one with a mutation to the EGFR (U87DeltaEGFR) that is associated with increased malignancy, and one with an endogenous (wild-type) receptor (U87WT). We developed a continuum mathematical model of the dispersion behaviors with the aim of identifying and characterizing discrete cellular mechanisms underlying invasive cell motility. The mathematical model quantitatively reproduces the experimental data, and indicates that the U87WT invasive cells have a stronger directional motility bias away from the spheroid center as well as a faster rate of cell shedding compared to the U87DeltaEGFR cells. The model suggests that differences in tumor cell dispersion may be due to differences in the chemical factors produced by cells, differences in how the two cell lines remodel the gel, or different cell-cell adhesion characteristics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17040992

Here, we show that cyclin G2 plays pivotal roles in the cytoskeletal dynamics in hypoxia-driven invasion by glioblastoma cells. Cyclin G2 is a hypoxia-induced and cytoskeleton-associated protein and is required for glioblastoma expansion. Mechanistically, cyclin G2 recruits cortactin to the juxtamembrane through its SH3 domain-binding motif and consequently promotes the restricted tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in concert with src. Moreover, cyclin G2 interacts with filamentous actin to facilitate the formation of membrane ruffles. In primary glioblastoma, cyclin G2 is abundantly expressed in severely hypoxic regions such as pseudopalisades, which consist of actively migrating glioma cells. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of dasatinib against hypoxia-driven, cyclin G2-involved invasion in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidate the mechanism of cytoskeletal regulation by which severe hypoxia promotes the local invasion and may provide a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24339739

These cells showed enhanced migratory and invasive ability on both Matrigel and organotypic brain slices compared to parental U251 cells. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 was specifically expressed in tumor sphere-forming cells derived from U251 and primary human glioma cells. Knockdown of MMP-13 expression by shRNA suppressed the migration and invasion of these cells.

"""Honokiol inhibits U87MG human glioblastoma cell invasion through endothelial cells by regulating membrane permeability and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.""","""Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal and prevalent malignant human brain tumors, with aggressive proliferation and highly invasive properties. There is still no effective cure for patients with glioblastoma. Honokiol, derived from Magnolia officinalis, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), making it a strong candidate for an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors, including glioblastoma. In our previous study, we demonstrated that honokiol effectively induced apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma. Metastasis poses the largest problem to cancer treatment and is the primary cause of death in cancer patients. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effect of honokiol on the cell invasion process of U87MG human glioblastoma cells through brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and its possible mechanisms. Honokiol dose-dependently inhibited TNF-Î±-induced VCAM-1 expression in BMECs and adhesion of U87MG to BMECs. Moreover, honokiol effectively blocked U87MG invasion through BMEC-Matrigel-coated transwell membranes. Increased phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and membrane permeability by TNF-Î± were suppressed by honokiol in BMECs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of honokiol on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in U87MG cells. Honokiol reduced the expression levels of Snail, N-cadherin and Î²-catenin, which are mesenchymal markers, but increased E-cadherin, an epithelial marker. In conclusion, these results suggest that honokiol inhibits metastasis by targeting the interaction between U87MG and BMECs, regulating the adhesion of U87MG to BMECs by inhibiting VCAM-1, and regulating the invasion of U87MG through BMECs by reducing membrane permeability and EMT processes of U87MG cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24247297

The aim of this study was to explore the differences in pathological and MRI-based intrinsic features (including morphologic and first-order features) between GBs with peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity (PFH-bearing GBs) and GBs without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity (PFH-free GBs). Methods: In total, 155 patients with pathologically diagnosed GBs were retrospectively collected, which included 110 PFH-bearing GBs and 45 PFH-free GBs. The pathological and imaging data were collected. The Visually AcceSAble Rembrandt Images (VASARI) features were carefully evaluated. The first-order radiomics features from the tumor region were extracted from FLAIR, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and T1CE (T1-contrast enhanced) images. All parameters were compared between the two groups of GBs. Results: The pathological data showed more alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)-loss in PFH-free GBs compared to PFH-bearing ones (p < 0.001). Based on VASARI evaluation, PFH-free GBs had larger intra-tumoral enhancing proportion and smaller necrotic proportion (both, p < 0.001), more common non-enhancing tumor (p < 0.001), mild/minimal enhancement (p = 0.003), expansive T1/FLAIR ratio (p < 0.001) and solid enhancement (p = 0.009), and less pial invasion (p = 0.010). Moreover, multiple ADC- and T1CE-based first-order radiomics features demonstrated differences, especially the lower intensity heterogeneity in PFH-free GBs (for all, adjusted p < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to PFH-bearing GBs, PFH-free ones demonstrated less immature neovascularization and lower intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which would be helpful in clinical treatment stratification. Clinical relevance statement: Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity show less immature neovascularization and lower heterogeneity leading to potential higher treatment benefits due to less drug resistance and treatment failure. Key points: â¢ The study explored the differences between glioblastomas with and without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity. â¢ Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity showed less necrosis and contrast enhancement and lower intensity heterogeneity. â¢ Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity had less immature neovascularization and lower tumor heterogeneity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37495706

These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable 'patient tumor's phenocopy' that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333277
"""The secreted glycolytic enzyme GPI/AMF stimulates glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in an autocrine fashion but can have anti-proliferative effects.""","""Background: Aerobic glycolysis confers several advantages to tumor cells, including shunting of metabolites into anabolic pathways. In glioblastoma cells, hypoxia induces a flux shift from the pentose phosphate pathway toward glycolysis and a switch from proliferation to migration. The mechanistic link between glycolysis and migration is poorly understood. Since glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) is identical to the secreted cytokine autocrine motility factor (AMF), we investigated whether GPI/AMF regulates glioblastoma cell invasion. Methods: The expression and hypoxic regulation of GPI/AMF and its receptor AMFR were analyzed in glioblastoma tissue and cell lines. Functional effects were studied in vitro and in xenograft models. Results: High GPI/AMF expression in glioblastomas was found to be associated with a worse patient prognosis, and levels were highest in hypoxic pseudopalisades. Hypoxia upregulated both GPI/AMF and AMFR expression as well as GPI/AMF secretion in vitro. GPI/AMF stimulated cell migration in an autocrine fashion, and GPI/AMF expression was upregulated in migratory cells but reduced in rapidly proliferating cells. Knockdown or inhibition of GPI/AMF reduced glioblastoma cell migration but in part stimulated proliferation. In a highly invasive orthotopic glioblastoma model, GPI/AMF knockdown reduced tumor cell invasion but did not prolong survival. In a highly proliferative model, knockdown tumors were even larger and more proliferative than controls; however, perivascular invasion, provoked by simultaneous bevacizumab treatment, was reduced. Conclusions: GPI/AMF is a potent motogen for glioblastoma cells, explaining in part the association between glycolysis and migration. Targeting GPI/AMF is, however, problematic, since beneficial anti-invasive effects may be outweighed by unintended mitogenic effects. Key points: 1.Increased glycolysis is linked with increased cell migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells. 2.The glycolysis enzyme GPI/AMF may serve as a target for antimetabolic and anti-invasive therapy. 3.Despite reducing tumor invasion, GPI/AMF targeting may have unwanted growth stimulatory effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30053149
"""The invasion promoting effect of microglia on glioblastoma cells is inhibited by cyclosporin A.""","""The invasion of tumour cells into brain tissue is a pathologic hallmark of WHO grades II-IV gliomas and contributes significantly to the failure of current therapeutic treatments. Activated microglial cells are abundant in brain tumours and may support tumour invasiveness. We have previously demonstrated that cyclosporin A (CsA) can affect growth of glioma cells in vitro by inhibiting signalling pathways, which are essential for tumour proliferation and invasiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that migration of EGFP-transfected glioblastoma cells in organotypic brain slices was significantly inhibited by treatment with CsA. On average 77% of untreated cells migrated beyond 500 mum, while only 28-33% cells migrated as far in the brain slices treated with CsA (P < 0.001). This inhibitory effect on glioblastoma invasion was lost when glioblastoma cells were injected into microglia-depleted brain slices. Moreover, CsA significantly inhibits intracranial glioma growth in vivo. We demonstrate that microglia-derived factors increase glioma invasiveness in Matrigel assay in vitro and this is associated with activation of the PI-3K/Akt signalling pathway. The invasion promoting effect of microglia is abolished in the presence of CsA. Furthermore, glioma-derived soluble factors induce morphological transformation of microglia and activate MAPK signalling, although production of pro-inflammatory factors was not observed. Our findings that CsA interferes at clinically relevant concentrations with the tumour-promoting role of microglia and impairs invasive growth of glioma cells in vivo may provide a novel therapeutic strategy against gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17107968

Moreover, down-regulation of CCR5 significantly inhibited the growth of glioma in U87 tumor xenograft mouse model.

Current methods of clinical imaging do not elucidate the full extent of brain invasion, making it difficult to predict which, if any, patients are likely to benefit from gross total resection. Our goal was to apply a mathematical modeling approach to estimate the overall tumor invasiveness on a patient-by-patient basis and determine whether gross total resection would improve survival in patients with relatively less invasive gliomas. Methods: In 243 patients presenting with contrast-enhancing gliomas, estimates of the relative invasiveness of each patient's tumor, in terms of the ratio of net proliferation rate of the glioma cells to their net dispersal rate, were derived by applying a patient-specific mathematical model to routine pretreatment MR imaging. The effect of varying degrees of extent of resection on overall survival was assessed for cohorts of patients grouped by tumor invasiveness. Results: We demonstrate that patients with more diffuse tumors showed no survival benefit (P = 0.532) from gross total resection over subtotal/biopsy, while those with nodular (less diffuse) tumors showed a significant benefit (P = 0.00142) with a striking median survival benefit of over eight months compared to sub-totally resected tumors in the same cohort (an 80% improvement in survival time for GTR only seen for nodular tumors). Conclusions: These results suggest that our patient-specific, model-based estimates of tumor invasiveness have clinical utility in surgical decision making.

"""FOXC2 often overexpressed in glioblastoma enhances proliferation and invasion in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and the leading cause of tumor-related death in the central nervous system. To date, the mechanisms of GBM genesis remain elusive. Forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) is a transcription factor that has been reported in many cancers, but its function in GBM tumorigenesis is not clearly elucidated. This study found that FOXC2 was overexpressed in GBM cell lines and GBM tissues. The proliferation and invasive potential of GBM cells were significantly increased by ectopic expression of FOXC2 but significantly decreased by RNA interference targeting FOXC2. EGFR expression was modulated by FOXC2 both in mRNA and protein levels. EGFR inhibition by siRNA reversed the FOXC2-induced proliferation and invasion. These findings suggested that FOXC2 expressed in GBM has a function in GBM cell proliferation and invasion and may be partly associated with the EGFR overexpression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24406047
"""Adenovirus-mediated delivery of CALR and MAGE-A3 inhibits invasion and angiogenesis of glioblastoma cell line U87.""","""Background: The management of patients with glioblastoma multiforme is difficult. Poor results have led to a search for novel therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy that could be both anti-invasive and antiangiogenic would be ideal. In this study, we constructed the recombinant adenoviral vector Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3 and evaluated its antitumor effects on glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Methods: In this study, CALR and MAGE-A3 genes were delivered to the glioblastoma cell line U87, using adenovirus (Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3). U87 glioblastoma cells were transfected with Ad-green fluorescent protein to identify the multiplicity of infection. The expressions of CALR and MAGE-A3 were detected by PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin-V FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry. The invasive potential of U87 cells was determined by Matrigel invasion assay. Tube formation assay was used to detect the effects on angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Protein expressions of PI3K/AKT, Erk1/2 and MMP-2/-9 in transfected cells were detected by Western blot. In vivo, the effects of Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3 on tumor growth and angiogenesis of U87 glioblastoma xenografts in nude mice were investigated. Results: The expressions of CALR and MAGE-A3 in U87 cells resulted in the suppression of cell proliferation and invasion properties, and induced cell apoptosis. The Erk MAPK, PI3K/AKT pathways and expressions of MMP-2/-9 were inhibited in Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3-transfected cells. Outcomes of the tube formation assay confirmed the antiangiogenic effect of CALR. Moreover, in the in vivo model of glioblastoma, intratumoral injection of Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3 suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis. Conclusion: Although Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3 and Ad-CALR demonstrated antiangiogenic effects on U87 cells, the repression of invasion was significant only in Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3-treated cells. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a role for combined CALR and MAGE-A3 in the anti-invasion and antiangiogenesis of U87.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22293781
"""Effects of anti-angiogenesis on glioblastoma growth and migration: model to clinical predictions.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) causes significant neurological morbidity and short survival times. Brain invasion by GBM is associated with poor prognosis. Recent clinical trials of bevacizumab in newly-diagnosed GBM found no beneficial effects on overall survival times; however, the baseline health-related quality of life and performance status were maintained longer in the bevacizumab group and the glucocorticoid requirement was lower. Here, we construct a clinical-scale model of GBM whose predictions uncover a new pattern of recurrence in 11/70 bevacizumab-treated patients. The findings support an exception to the Folkman hypothesis: GBM grows in the absence of angiogenesis by a cycle of proliferation and brain invasion that expands necrosis. Furthermore, necrosis is positively correlated with brain invasion in 26 newly-diagnosed GBM. The unintuitive results explain the unusual clinical effects of bevacizumab and suggest new hypotheses on the dynamic clinical effects of migration by active transport, a mechanism of hypoxia-driven brain invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25506702
"""SPOCK1 is upregulated in recurrent glioblastoma and contributes to metastasis and Temozolomide resistance.""","""Objectives: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumour type in humans. Its poor prognosis is largely attributed to its invasiveness and high rate of recurrence. Recurring GBM is commonly resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, making it specially difficult to treat. Recent studies have revealed that matricellular glycoprotein SPOCK1 to be upregulated in several cancer types and to be specifically expressed in invasive GBM, but not in other types of non-invasive brain tumour, which prompted us to study the mechanism of action of SPOCK1 in invasion, recurrence and drug resistance of GBM cells. Materials and methods: SPOCK1 expression in GBM tissues was evaluated using qPCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Cell migration was tested by the wound healing method and cell invasion was assessed using transwell plates with Matrigel coating. Western blotting was performed for E-cadherin, vimentin, N-cadherin, p-Akt and Akt. Cell viability was examined using the MTT assay. Results: We found that the expression of SPOCK1 was significantly upregulated in recurrent GBM. We also demonstrated that SPOCK1 positively regulated migration, invasion and EMT process of GBM cells. Furthermore, SPOCK1 mediated TMZ resistance in GBM, as knockdown of SPOCK1 expression in TMZ-resistant GBM cells substantially sensitized these cells to TMZ. Conclusion: SPOCK1 results were positive and it mediated TMZ resistance in GBM.

"""Transcriptome profiling-based identification of prognostic subtypes and multi-omics signatures of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal tumor, but few biomarkers and molecular subtypes predicting prognosis are available. This study was aimed to identify prognostic subtypes and multi-omics signatures for GBM. Using oncopression and TCGA-GBM datasets, we identified 80 genes most associated with GBM prognosis using correlations between gene expression levels and overall survival of patients. The prognostic score of each sample was calculated using these genes, followed by assigning three prognostic subtypes. This classification was validated in two independent datasets (REMBRANDT and Severance). Functional annotation revealed that invasion- and cell cycle-related gene sets were enriched in poor and favorable group, respectively. The three GBM subtypes were therefore named invasive (poor), mitotic (favorable), and intermediate. Interestingly, invasive subtype showed increased invasiveness, and MGMT methylation was enriched in mitotic subtype, indicating need for different therapeutic strategies according to prognostic subtypes. For clinical convenience, we also identified genes that best distinguished the invasive and mitotic subtypes. Immunohistochemical staining showed that markedly higher expression of PDPN in invasive subtype and of TMEM100 in mitotic subtype (P < 0.001). We expect that this transcriptome-based classification, with multi-omics signatures and biomarkers, can improve molecular understanding of GBM, ultimately leading to precise stratification of patients for therapeutic interventions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332251
"""Suppression of LIM Kinase 1 and LIM Kinase 2 Limits Glioblastoma Invasion.""","""The aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by rapid cellular infiltration of brain tissue, raising the possibility that disease progression could potentially be slowed by disrupting the machinery of cell migration. The LIM kinase isoforms LIMK1 and LIMK2 (LIMK1/2) play important roles in cell polarization, migration, and invasion and are markedly upregulated in GBM and many other infiltrative cancers. Yet, it remains unclear whether LIMK suppression could serve as a viable basis for combating GBM infiltration. In this study, we investigated effects of LIMK1/2 suppression on GBM invasion by combining GBM culture models, engineered invasion paradigms, and mouse xenograft models. While knockdown of either LIMK1 or LIMK2 only minimally influenced invasion in culture, simultaneous knockdown of both isoforms strongly reduced the invasive motility of continuous culture models and human GBM tumor-initiating cells (TIC) in both Boyden chamber and 3D hyaluronic acid spheroid invasion assays. Furthermore, LIMK1/2 functionally regulated cell invasiveness, in part, by disrupting polarized cell motility under confinement and cell chemotaxis. In an orthotopic xenograft model, TICs stably transduced with LIMK1/2 shRNA were implanted intracranially in immunocompromised mice. Tumors derived from LIMK1/2 knockdown TICs were substantially smaller and showed delayed growth kinetics and more distinct margins than tumors derived from control TICs. Overall, LIMK1/2 suppression increased mean survival time by 30%. These findings indicate that LIMK1/2 strongly regulate GBM invasive motility and tumor progression and support further exploration of LIMK1/2 as druggable targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting the actin-binding proteins LIMK1 and LIMK2 significantly diminishes glioblastoma invasion and spread, suggesting the potential value of these proteins as therapeutic targets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641031

"""ILK silencing inhibits migration and invasion of more invasive glioblastoma cells by downregulating ROCK1 and Fascin-1.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor and it is associated with poor survival. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine/threonine protein pseudo-kinase that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of Î²1 and Î²3 integrins and has been previously shown to promote invasion and metastasis in many cancer types, including GBM. However, little is known regarding the exact molecular mechanism implicating ILK in GBM aggressiveness. In this study, we used two brain cell lines, the non-invasive neuroglioma H4 cells, and the highly invasive glioblastoma A172 cells, which express ILK in much higher levels than H4. We studied the effect of ILK silencing on the metastatic behavior of glioblastoma cells in vitro and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. We showed that siRNA-mediated silencing of ILK inhibits cell migration and invasion of the highly invasive A172 cells while it does not affect the migratory and invasive capacity of H4 cells. These data were also supported by respective changes in the expression of Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1), fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1), and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), which are known to regulate cell migration and invasion. Our findings were further corroborated by analyzing the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) dataset.

"""Identifying conserved molecular targets required for cell migration of glioblastoma cancer stem cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor and is associated with extensive tumor cell infiltration into the adjacent brain parenchyma. However, there are limited targeted therapies that address this disease hallmark. While the invasive capacity of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their non-CSC progeny has been investigated, the mode(s) of migration used by CSCs during invasion is currently unknown. Here we used time-lapse microscopy to evaluate the migratory behavior of CSCs, with a focus on identifying key regulators of migration. A head-to-head migration assay demonstrated that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs. Time-lapse live cell imaging further revealed that GBM patient-derived CSC models either migrate in a collective manner or in a single cell fashion. To uncover conserved molecular regulators responsible for collective cell invasion, we utilized the genetically tractable Drosophila border cell collective migration model. Candidates for functional studies were generated using results from a targeted Drosophila genetic screen followed by gene expression analysis of the human homologs in GBM tumors and associated GBM patient prognosis. This strategy identified the highly conserved small GTPase, Rap1a, as a potential regulator of cell invasion. Alteration of Rap1a activity impaired the forward progress of Drosophila border cells during development. Rap1a expression was elevated in GBM and associated with higher tumor grade. Functionally, the levels of activated Rap1a impacted CSC migration speed out of spheres onto extracellular matrix. The data presented here demonstrate that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs, are capable of both collective and single cell migration, and express conserved genes that are required for migration and invasion. Using this integrated approach, we identified a new role for Rap1a in the migration of GBM CSCs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102991

In this study, we found that the expression level of IMD was positively related to the malignancy grade of gliomas. The highest expression of IMD was found in GBM, indicating that IMD may play an important role in glioma malignancy. IMD increased the invasive ability of glioma cells by promoting filopodia formation, which is dependent on ERK1/2 activation. IMD-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation also promoted GBM cell proliferation. In addition, IMD enhanced mitochondrial function and hypoxia-induced responses in GBM cells. Treatment with anti-IMD monoclonal antibodies not only inhibited tumor growth in both ectopic and orthotopic models of GBM but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of temozolomide.

It is possible that P4 mediates some of these effects through changes in the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in GBM cells. The present study investigated the effects of P4 on miRNAs expression profile in Uâ251MG cells derived from a human GBM. Uâ251MG cells were treated for 6 h with P4, RU486 (an antagonist of the intracellular progesterone receptor), the combined treatment (P4+RU486) and cyclodextrin (vehicle) and then a miRNA microarray analysis conducted.

However, its role in glioblastoma invasion is still unknown. This study shows how IL-6 promotes cell invasion and migration in U251 and T98G glioblastoma cell lines. The underlying mechanism includes both protease-dependent and -independent manners. Stimulation with IL-6 increased MMP9 expression in the two cell lines but had no influence on MMP2 expression. Fascin-1 is a cell skeleton binding protein and plays a key role in cell migration and invasion. Its binding style directly influences cell morphology and tendency to become deformed. After IL-6 exposure, fascin-1 expression increased in an IL-6 dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence also revealed that the binding style of fascin-1 had changed after IL-6 exposure, resulting in a more invasive phenotype of the cells. Three most commonly emphasized invasion-associated signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT3, p42/44 MAPK, and PI3K/AKT, were verified to further illustrate its underlying mechanism. Only phosphorylation of STAT3 at ser 727 site paralleled the IL-6 stimulation, and JSI-124, a specific JAK-STAT3 pathway blocker, deterred the invasion and migration promotive effect of IL-6, indicating that the JAK/STAT3 pathway mediates signal transduction. Furthermore, IL-6 also acts in a paracrine fashion to promote vascular endothelial cell migration, thus facilitating tumor angiogenesis and invasion.

Tetraspanin CD151 and its associated Î±3Î²1 integrin have been implicated in facilitating tumor progression across multiple cancer types. How these adhesion molecules are involved in the progression of glioblastoma, however, remains largely unclear. Here, we examined an in-house tissue microarray-based cohort of 96 patient biopsies and TCGA dataset to evaluate the clinical significance of CD151 and Î±3Î²1 integrin.

Results from our analyses showed that CD151 and Î±3 integrin were significantly elevated in glioblastomas at both protein and mRNA levels, and exhibited strong inverse correlation with patient survival (p < 0.006). These adhesion molecules also formed tight protein complexes and synergized with EGF/EGFR to accelerate tumor cell motility and invasion. Furthermore, disruption of such complexes enhanced the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a xenograft model, and impaired activation of FAK and small GTPases. Also, knockdown- or pharmacological agent-based attenuation of EGFR, FAK or Graf (ARHGAP26)/small GTPase-mediated pathways markedly mitigated the aggressiveness of glioblastoma cells.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular glutathione (GSH), has been widely implicated in prevention and therapy of several cancers. However, the role of NAC in GBM remains unclear and the property of NAC independent of its antioxidation is largely unknown. Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of Notch family and other related factors were detected by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. In addition, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry-based DCFH-DA. Moreover, cell viability was assessed by CCK8 and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry-based PI staining. The level of apoptosis was checked by flow cytometry-based Annexin V/PI. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and transwell invasion assays. At last, U87 Xenograft model was established to confirm whether NAC could restrain the growth of tumor. Results: Our data showed that NAC could decrease the protein level of Notch2. Meanwhile, NAC had a decreasing effect on the mRNA and protein levels of its downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1. These effects caused by NAC were independent of cellular GSH and ROS levels. The mechanism of NAC-mediated Notch2 reduction was elucidated by promoting Notch2 degradation through Itch-dependent lysosome pathway. Furthermore, NAC could prevent proliferation, migration, and invasion and might induce apoptosis in GBM cells via targeting Notch2. Significantly, NAC could suppress the growth of tumor in vivo. Conclusions: NAC could facilitate Notch2 degradation through lysosomal pathway in an antioxidant-independent manner, thus attenuating Notch2 malignant signaling in GBM cells.

LRP mRNA was frequently expressed in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas compared with low-grade astrocytomas by RT-PCR analysis, and was well correlated with uPAR expression. The immunohistochemistry of LRP on sequential frozen sections showed that neoplastic glial cells and endothelial cells of glioblastomas exhibited intense LRP immunoreactivity, whereas LRP was almost undetectable in low-grade astrocytomas or in normal glial cells and endothelial cells of normal brain tissue. Glioblastomas from 11 patients in which the expression of LRP mRNA was observed by PCR displayed strong to moderate LRP immunoreactivity, with predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic and cell-surface localization. In normal brain tissues, LRP immunoreactivity was identified in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex.

In this study, we defined the expression and function of miR-134, which we found to be downregulated in glioma samples and the glioblastoma cell line U87 by SYBR green real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (real-time PCR). Early reports have characterized Nanog as a direct target of miR-134 by a dual-luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells.

These findings demonstrated that miR-134 deregulation is common in human gliomas. Restoration of its function inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration capability and promotes apoptosis, which could be partly due to its inhibitory effect on Nanog protein expression in glioblastoma cells.

We show here that an extracellular protein released by glioblastoma cells, fibulin-3, drives oncogenic NF-ÎºB in the tumor and increases NF-ÎºB activation in peritumoral astrocytes. Fibulin-3 expression correlates with a NF-ÎºB-regulated 'invasive signature' linked to poorer survival, being a possible tissue marker for regions of active tumor progression. Accordingly, fibulin-3 promotes glioblastoma invasion in a manner that requires NF-ÎºB activation both in the tumor cells and their microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that fibulin-3 activates the metalloprotease ADAM17 by competing with its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP3. This results in sustained release of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) by ADAM17, which in turn activates TNF receptors and canonical NF-ÎºB signaling. Taken together, our results underscore fibulin-3 as a novel extracellular signal with strong activating effect on NF-ÎºB in malignant gliomas. Because fibulin-3 is produced de novo in these tumors and is absent from the normal brain, we propose that targeting the fibulin-3/NF-ÎºB axis may provide a novel avenue to disrupt oncogenic NF-ÎºB signaling in combination therapies for malignant brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28414309
"""Endogenous tenascin-C enhances glioblastoma invasion with reactive change of surrounding brain tissue.""","""Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein implicated in embryogenesis, wound healing and tumor progression. We previously revealed that tenascin-C expression is correlated with the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma. However, the exact role of endogenous tenascin-C in regulation of glioblastoma proliferation and invasion remains to be established. We show here that endogenous tenascin-C facilitates glioblastoma invasion, followed by reactive change of the surrounding brain tissue. Although shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous tenascin-C does not affect proliferation of glioblastoma cells, it abolishes cell migration on a two-dimensional substrate and tumor invasion with brain tissue changes in a xenograft model. The tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that associates with integrins, was decreased in tenascin-C-knockdown cells. In the analysis of clinical samples, tenascin-C expression correlates with the volume of peritumoral reactive change detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Interestingly, glioblastoma cells with high tenascin-C expression infiltrate brain tissue in an autocrine manner. Our results suggest that endogenous tenascin-C contributes the invasive nature of glioblastoma and the compositional change of brain tissue, which renders tenascin-C as a prime candidate for anti-invasion therapy for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19459858
"""CD166/activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule is expressed on glioblastoma progenitor cells and involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion.""","""For improvement of prognosis for glioblastoma patients, which remains poor, identification and targeting of glioblastoma progenitor cells are crucial. In this study, we found that the cluster of differentiation (CD)166/activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) was highly expressed on CD133+ glioblastoma progenitor cells. ALCAM+ CD133+ cells were highly enriched with tumor sphere-initiating cells in vitro. Among gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/R132H mutation, the frequencies of ALCAM+ cells were significantly higher for glioblastomas than for World Health Organization grade II or III gliomas. The function of ALCAM in glioblastoma was then investigated. An in vitro invasion assay showed that transfection of ALCAM small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA into glioblastoma cells significantly increased cell invasion without affecting cell proliferation. A soluble isoform of ALCAM (sALCAM) was also expressed in all glioblastoma samples and at levels that correlated well with ALCAM expression levels. In vitro invasion of glioblastoma cells was significantly enhanced by administration of purified sALCAM. Furthermore, overexpression of sALCAM in U87MG glioblastoma cells promoted tumor progression in i.c. transplants into immune-deficient mice. In summary, we were able to show that ALCAM constitutes a novel glioblastoma progenitor cell marker. We could also demonstrate that ALCAM and its soluble isoform are involved in the regulation of glioblastoma invasion and progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22166264
"""Tumoral RANKL activates astrocytes that promote glioma cell invasion through cytokine signaling.""","""The invasiveness of glioblastoma is a major cause of poor prognosis and relapse. However, the molecular mechanism controlling glioma cell invasion is poorly understood. Here, we report that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFÎºB) ligand (RANKL) promotes glioma cell invasion in vivo, but not in vitro. Unlike the invasiveness under in vitro culture conditions, in vivo xenograft studies revealed that LN229 cells expressing high endogenous RANKL generated more invasive tumors than U87MG cells expressing relatively low endogenous RANKL. Consistently, RANKL-overexpressing U87MG resulted in invasive tumors, whereas RANKL-depleted LN229 generated rarely invasive tumors. We found that the number of activated astrocytes was markedly increased in the periphery of RANKL-high invasive tumors. RANKL activated astrocytes through NFÎºB signaling and these astrocytes in turn secreted various factors which regulate glioma cell invasion. Among them, transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling was markedly increased in glioblastoma specimens and xenograft tumors expressing high levels of RANKL. These results indicate that RANKL contributes to glioma invasion by modulating the peripheral microenvironment of the tumor, and that targeting RANKL signaling has important implications for the prevention of highly invasive glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25079688

Following orthotopic implantation, mKate2-expressing cells were detected using multispectral imaging. Results: Flow cytometry-sorted fluorescent populations exhibiting growth curves that were comparable to those of the parental line were selected. mKate2-expressing cells were inoculated orthotopically and formed tumors which were visualized non-invasively, allowing monitoring of tumor growth over time and the assessment of tumor response to temozolomide drug treatment.

In this study, sixteen fresh-frozen glioblastoma samples and seven samples of healthy brain tissues were analyzed with miRNA and whole transcriptome microarray chips. Candidate miRNAs and mRNAs were selected to validate expression in fifty patient samples in total with the criteria of abundance, relevance and prediction scores. miRNA and target mRNA relationships were assessed by inhibiting selected miRNAs in glioblastoma cells. Functional tests have been conducted in order to see the effects of miRNAs on invasion, migration and apoptosis of GBM cells. Analyses were carried out to determine correlations between selected molecules and clinicopathological features. 1332 genes and 319 miRNAs were found to be dysregulated by the microarrays. The results were combined and analyzed with Transcriptome Analysis Console 3 software and the DAVID online database. Primary differential pathways included Ras, HIF-1, MAPK signaling and cell adhesion. OncomiR candidates 21-5p, 92b-3p, 182-5p and 339-5p for glioblastoma negatively correlated with notable mRNA targets both in tissues and in in vitro experiments. miR-21-5p and miR-339-5p significantly affected migration, invasion and apoptosis of GBM cells in vitro. Significant correlations with overall survival, tumor volume, recurrence and age at diagnosis were discovered.

Since cytoskeleton proteins are related to leading processes and cell motility, and through analysis of public GBM databases, we determined that an actin-interacting protein, zyxin (ZYX), may involved in GBM invasion. Our own glioma cohort as well as the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), Rembrandt, and Gravendeel databases consistently showed that increased ZYX expression was related to tumor progression and poor prognosis of glioma patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments further confirmed the oncogenic roles of ZYX and demonstrated the role of ZYX in GBM invasive growth. Moreover, RNA-seq and mass-spectrum data from GBM cells with or without ZYX revealed that stathmin 1 (STMN1) was a potential target of ZYX. Subsequently, we found that both mRNA and protein levels of STMN1 were positively regulated by ZYX. Functionally, STMN1 not only promoted invasion of GBM cells but also rescued the invasion repression caused by ZYX loss. Taken together, our results indicate that high ZYX expression was associated with worse prognosis and highlighted that the ZYX-STMN1 axis might be a potential therapeutic target for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31949244

The migratory and invasive ability of glioma cells were enhanced by hypoxia treatment but inhibited by down-regulation of HIF-1Î±. GGTI activity inhibition or GGTI specific Î² subunit (GGTI Î²) knocking-down decreased HIF-1Î± protein level. In addition, down-regulation of GGTI Î² inhibited migration and invasion of glioma cells under hypoxia, while GGTI Î² over-expression promoted it. Furthermore, the effect of GGTI Î² over-expression on cell migration and invasion was abolished by HIF-1Î± down-regulation. In summary, our study showed, for the first time, that HIF-1Î± was regulated by protein prenylation transferase GGTI and mediated the effect of GGTI on glioma cell migration and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23475391

Here we report that hypoxia significantly stimulated H19 expression in glioblastoma cell lines, which was related to hypoxia-inducible factors 1Î± (Hif-1Î±). Hif-1Î± promoted H19 expression in U87 and U251 cells. Meanwhile PTEN is an advantageous factor to affect H19 expression, through attenuating Hif-1Î± stability. Hif-1Î± also positively correlates with H19 in human glioblastoma samples depending on PTEN status. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays showed that Hif-1Î± induced H19 transcription through directly binding to the H19 promoter. Furthermore, Hif-1Î± upregulated specific protein 1 (SP1) expression in glioblastomas cells in vitro and in vivo, and SP1 also strongly interacted with the H19 promoter to promote H19 expression under hypoxia. We also showed that H19 acts as a molecular sponge that binds miR-181d, relieving inhibition of Î²-catenin expression. Therefore, H19 participates in hypoxia-driven migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells. In summary, our results uncover the mechanisms that stimulate H19 expression under hypoxia to promote malignant effects in glioblastomas and suggest H19 might be a promising therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28327666
"""A role for caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and CAVIN1 in the pro-invasive response of glioblastoma to osmotic and hydrostatic pressure.""","""In solid tumours, elevated interstitial fluid pressure (osmotic and hydrostatic pressure) is a barrier to drug delivery and correlates with poor prognosis. Glioblastoma (GBM) further experience compressive force when growing within a space limited by the skull. Caveolae are proposed to play mechanosensing roles, and caveola-forming proteins are overexpressed in GBM. We asked whether caveolae mediate the GBM response to osmotic pressure. We evaluated in vitro the influence of spontaneous or experimental down-regulation of caveola-forming proteins (caveolin-1, CAVIN1) on the proteolytic profile and invasiveness of GBM cells in response to osmotic pressure. In response to osmotic pressure, GBM cell lines expressing caveola-forming proteins up-regulated plasminogen activator (uPA) and/or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), some EMT markers and increased their in vitro invasion potential. Down-regulation of caveola-forming proteins impaired this response and prevented hyperosmolarity-induced mRNA expression of the water channel aquaporin 1. CRISPR ablation of caveola-forming proteins further lowered expression of matrix proteases and EMT markers in response to hydrostatic pressure, as a model of mechanical force. GBM respond to pressure by increasing matrix-degrading enzyme production, mesenchymal phenotype and invasion. Caveola-forming proteins mediate, at least in part, the pro-invasive response of GBM to pressure. This may represent a novel target in GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32065471
"""The kinesin Eg5 inhibitor K858 induces apoptosis and reverses the malignant invasive phenotype in human glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary malignant brain tumor and its current chemotherapeutic options are limited to temozolomide. Recently, some synthetic compounds acting as inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein Eg5 have shown pronounced antitumor activity. Our group has recently demonstrated that one of these kinesin Eg5 inhibitors, named K858, exerted important antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on breast cancer cells. Since glioblastoma cells usually express high levels of kinesin Eg5, we tested the effect of K858 on two human glioblastoma cell lines (U-251 and U-87) and found that K858 inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis, reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibited migration in both cell lines. We also detected that, at the same time, K858 increased the expression of survivin, an anti-apoptotic molecule, and that the forced down-regulation of survivin, obtained with the specific inhibitor YM155, boosted K858-dependent apoptosis. This indicated that the anti-tumor activity of K858 on glioblastoma cells is limited by the over-expression of survivin and that the negative regulation of this protein sensitizes tumor cells to K858. These data confirmed that kinesin Eg5 is an interesting target for new therapeutic approaches for glioblastoma.

GB cells exhibit a preference for hypoxia to maintain their tumor-forming capacity. Enhancing oxidative phosphorylation-known as the anti-Warburg effect-with cyclic AMP activators has been demonstrated to drive GB cells from proliferation to differentiation thereby reducing tumor growth in a cell culture approach. Here we re-evaluate this treatment in a more clinically relevant model. (2) Methods: The effect of treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP, 1 mM) and the cAMP activator forskolin (50ÂµM) was assessed in a GB cell line (U87GFP+, 104 cells) co-cultured with mouse organotypic brain slices providing architecture and biochemical properties of normal brain tissue. Cell viability was determined by propidium-iodide, and gross metabolic effects were excluded in the extracellular medium.

Through mathematical modelling, we model the process of invasion and predict the relative importance of mechanisms contributing to malignant invasion. Clinically, we predict patterns of tumour recurrence following various modes of therapeutic intervention. Materials and methods: Our mathematical model uses a realistic three-dimensional brain geometry and considers migrating and proliferating cells as separate classes. Several mechanisms for infiltrative migration are considered. Methods are developed for simulating surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Results: The model provides clinically realistic predictions of tumour growth and recurrence following therapeutic intervention. Specific results include (i) invasiveness is governed largely by the ability of glioblastoma cells to degrade and migrate through the extracellular matrix and the ability of single migrating cells to form colonies; (ii) tumours originating deeper in the brain generally grow more quickly than those of superficial origin; (iii) upon surgery, the margins and geometry of resection significantly determine the extent and pattern of postoperative recurrence; (iv) radiotherapy works synergistically with greater resection margins to reduce recurrence; (v) simulations in both two- and three-dimensional geometries give qualitatively similar results; and (vi) in an actual clinical case comprising several surgical interventions, the model provides good qualitative agreement between the simulated and observed course of the disease.

GBM cells reproduce quickly, and the median survival time for patients after therapy is approximately 1 year with a high relapse rate. Current therapies and diagnostic tools for GBM are limited; therefore, we searched for a more favorable therapeutic target or marker protein for both therapy and diagnosis. We used mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify GBM-associated marker proteins from human plasma and GBM cell cultures. Additional plasma and 52 brain tissues obtained from patients with gliomas were used to validate the association rate of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) in different grades of gliomas and its distribution in tumors. Microarray database analysis further validated the coefficient of SAA1 levels in gliomas. The cellular mechanisms of SAA1 in GBM proliferation and infiltration were investigated in vitro. We analyzed the correlation between SAA1 and patients' medication requirement to demonstrate the clinical effects of SAA1 in GBM. SAA1 was identified from MS analysis, and its level was revealed to be correlated with the disease grade, clinical severity, and survival rate of patients with gliomas. In vitro cultures, including GBM cells and normal astrocytes, revealed that SAA1 promotes cell migration and invasion through integrin Î±VÎ²3 to activate the Erk signaling pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging and tumor region-specific microarray analysis identified a correlation between SAA1 and GBM cell infiltration in patients. In summary, our results demonstrate that SAA1 in combination with integrin Î±V and Î²3 can serve as an indicator of high glioblastoma risk. We also identified the cellular mechanisms of SAA1 contributing to GBM progression, which can serve as the basis for future GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29603594
"""Galectin-1, a gene preferentially expressed at the tumor margin, promotes glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Background: High-grade gliomas, including glioblastomas (GBMs), are recalcitrant to local therapy in part because of their ability to invade the normal brain parenchyma surrounding these tumors. Animal models capable of recapitulating glioblastoma invasion may help identify mediators of this aggressive phenotype. Methods: Patient-derived glioblastoma lines have been propagated in our laboratories and orthotopically xenografted into the brains of immunocompromized mice. Invasive cells at the tumor periphery were isolated using laser capture microdissection. The mRNA expression profile of these cells was compared to expression at the tumor core, using normal mouse brain to control for host contamination. Galectin-1, a target identified by screening the resulting data, was stably over-expressed in the U87MG cell line. Sub-clones were assayed for attachment, proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumor phenotype. Results: Expression microarray data identified galectin-1 as the most potent marker (p-value 4.0 x 10-8) to identify GBM cells between tumor-brain interface as compared to the tumor core. Over-expression of galectin-1 enhanced migration and invasion in vitro. In vivo, tumors expressing high galectin-1 levels showed enhanced invasion and decreased host survival. Conclusions: In conclusion, cells at the margin of glioblastoma, in comparison to tumor core cells, have enhanced expression of mediators of invasion. Galectin-1 is likely one such mediator. Previous studies, along with the current one, have proven galectin-1 to be important in the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells, in GBM neoangiogenesis, and also, potentially, in GBM immune privilege.

"""Spatial optimization for radiation therapy of brain tumours.""","""Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumours. They are known for their highly aggressive growth and invasion, leading to short survival times. Treatments for glioblastomas commonly involve a combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (XRT). Previous works have not only successfully modelled the natural growth of glioblastomas in vivo, but also show potential for the prediction of response to radiation prior to treatment. This suggests that the efficacy of XRT can be optimized before treatment in order to yield longer survival times. However, while current efforts focus on optimal scheduling of radiotherapy treatment, they do not include a similarly sophisticated spatial optimization. In an effort to improve XRT, we present a method for the spatial optimization of radiation profiles. We expand upon previous results in the general problem and examine the more physically reasonable cases of 1-step and 2-step radiation profiles during the first and second XRT fractions.

"""Growth factor independence underpins a paroxysmal, aggressive Wnt5a(High)/EphA2(Low) phenotype in glioblastoma stem cells, conducive to experimental combinatorial therapy.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable tumor, with a median survival rate of only 14-15 months. Along with heterogeneity and unregulated growth, a central matter in dealing with GBMs is cell invasiveness. Thus, improving prognosis requires finding new agents to inhibit key multiple pathways, even simultaneously. A subset of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) may account for tumorigenicity, representing, through their pathways, the proper cellular target in the therapeutics of glioblastomas. GSCs cells are routinely enriched and expanded due to continuous exposure to specific growth factors, which might alter some of their intrinsic characteristic and hide therapeutically relevant traits. Methods: By removing exogenous growth factors stimulation, here we isolated and characterized a subset of GSCs with a 'mitogen-independent' phenotype (I-GSCs) from patient's tumor specimens. Differential side-by-side comparative functional and molecular analyses were performed either in vitro or in vivo on these cells versus their classical growth factor (GF)-dependent counterpart (D-GSCs) as well as their tissue of origin. This was performed to pinpoint the inherent GSCs' critical regulators, with particular emphasis on those involved in spreading and tumorigenic potential. Transcriptomic fingerprints were pointed out by ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) and association of copy number alterations or somatic mutations was determined by comparing each subgroup with a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. The combined effects of interacting in vitro and in vivo with two emerging GSCs' key regulators, such as Wnt5a and EphA2, were then predicted under in vivo experimental settings that are conducive to clinical applications. In vivo comparisons were carried out in mouse-human xenografts GBM model by a hierarchical linear model for repeated measurements and Dunnett's multiple comparison test with the distribution of survival compared by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Here, we assessed that a subset of GSCs from high-grade gliomas is self-sufficient in the activation of regulatory growth signaling. Furthermore, while constitutively present within the same GBM tissue, these GF-independent GSCs cells were endowed with a distinctive functional and molecular repertoire, defined by highly aggressive Wnt5aHigh/EphA2Low profile, as opposed to Wnt5aLow/EphA2High expression in sibling D-GSCs. Regardless of their GBM subtype of origin, I-GSCs, are endowed with a raised in vivo tumorigenic potential than matched D-GSCs, which were fast-growing ex-vivo but less lethal and invasive in vivo. Also, the malignant I-GSCs' transcriptomic fingerprint faithfully mirrored the original tumor, bringing into evidence key regulators of invasiveness, angiogenesis and immuno-modulators, which became candidates for glioma diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Particularly, simultaneously counteracting the activity of the tissue invasive mediator Wnt5a and EphA2 tyrosine kinase receptor addictively hindered GSCs' tumorigenic and invasive ability, thus increasing survival. Conclusion: We show how the preservation of a mitogen-independent phenotype in GSCs plays a central role in determining the exacerbated tumorigenic and high mobility features distinctive of GBM. The exploitation of the I-GSCs' peculiar features shown here offers new ways to identify novel, GSCs-specific effectors, whose modulation can be used in order to identify novel, potential molecular therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we show how the combined use of PepA, the anti-Wnt5a drug, and of ephrinA1-Fc to can hinder GSCs' lethality in a clinically relevant xenogeneic in vivo model thus being conducive to perspective, novel combinatorial clinical application.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35414102

They are essential for glioma invasion and vasculogenesis processes. It is hypothesized that irradiated normal brain tissues promotes tumor invasion and vasculogenesis, resulting in glioma recurrence.

Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing glioma-initiating cells (GICs) at the apex. To discover new GIC targets, we used in vivo delivery of phage display technology to screen for molecules selectively binding GICs that may be amenable for targeting. Phage display leverages large, diverse peptide libraries to identify interactions with molecules in their native conformation. We delivered a bacteriophage peptide library intravenously to a glioblastoma xenograft in vivo then derived GICs. Phage peptides bound to GICs were analyzed for their corresponding proteins and ranked based on prognostic value, identifying VAV3, a Rho guanine exchange factor involved tumor invasion, and CD97 (cluster of differentiation marker 97), an adhesion G-protein-coupled-receptor upstream of Rho, as potentially enriched in GICs. We confirmed that both VAV3 and CD97 were preferentially expressed by tumor cells expressing GIC markers. VAV3 expression correlated with increased activity of its downstream mediator, Rac1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), in GICs. Furthermore, targeting VAV3 by ribonucleic acid interference decreased GIC growth, migration, invasion and in vivo tumorigenesis. As CD97 is a cell surface protein, CD97 selection enriched for sphere formation, a surrogate of self-renewal. In silico analysis demonstrated VAV3 and CD97 are highly expressed in tumors and inform poor survival and tumor grade, and more common with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Finally, a VAV3 peptide sequence identified on phage display specifically internalized into GICs.

"""Molecular crosstalk between tumour and brain parenchyma instructs histopathological features in glioblastoma.""","""The histopathological and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas represents a major obstacle for effective therapies. Glioblastomas do not develop autonomously, but evolve in a unique environment that adapts to the growing tumour mass and contributes to the malignancy of these neoplasms. Here, we show that patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts generated in the mouse brain from organotypic spheroids reproducibly give rise to three different histological phenotypes: (i) a highly invasive phenotype with an apparent normal brain vasculature, (ii) a highly angiogenic phenotype displaying microvascular proliferation and necrosis and (iii) an intermediate phenotype combining features of invasion and vessel abnormalities. These phenotypic differences were visible during early phases of tumour development suggesting an early instructive role of tumour cells on the brain parenchyma. Conversely, we found that tumour-instructed stromal cells differentially influenced tumour cell proliferation and migration in vitro, indicating a reciprocal crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. We did not detect any transdifferentiation of tumour cells into endothelial cells. Cell type-specific transcriptomic analysis of tumour and endothelial cells revealed a strong phenotype-specific molecular conversion between the two cell types, suggesting co-evolution of tumour and endothelial cells. Integrative bioinformatic analysis confirmed the reciprocal crosstalk between tumour and microenvironment and suggested a key role for TGFÎ²1 and extracellular matrix proteins as major interaction modules that shape glioblastoma progression.

"""Specificity protein 1 expression contributes to Bcl-w-induced aggressiveness in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""We already had reported that Bcl-w promotes invasion or migration in gastric cancer cells and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by activating matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) via specificity protein 1 (Sp1) or Î²-cateinin, respectively. High expression of Bcl-w also has been reported in GBM which is the most common malignant brain tumor and exhibits aggressive and invasive behavior. These reports propose that Bcl-w-induced signaling is strongly associated with aggressive characteristic of GBM. We demonstrated that Sp1 protein or mRNA expression is induced by Bcl-w using Western blotting or RT-PCR, respectively, and markedly elevated in high-grade glioma specimens compared with low-grade glioma tissues using tissue array. However, relationship between Bcl-w-related signaling and aggressive characteristic of GBM is poorly characterized. This study suggested that Bcl-w-induced Sp1 activation promoted expression of glioma stem-like cell markers, such as Musashi, Nanog, Oct4 and sox-2, as well as neurosphere formation and invasiveness, using western blotting, neurosphere formation assay, or invasion assay, culminating in their aggressive behavior. Therefore, Bcl-w-induced Sp1 activation is proposed as a putative marker for aggressiveness of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24552705
"""TP3, an antimicrobial peptide, inhibits infiltration and motility of glioblastoma cells via modulating the tumor microenvironment.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a cancer of the central nervous system with limited therapeutic outcomes. Infiltrating cancer cells are the contributing factor to high GBM malignancy. The intracranial brain cancer cell infiltration is a complex cascade involving adhesion, migration, and invasion. An arsenal of natural products has been under exploration to overcome GBM malignancy. This study applied the antimicrobial peptide tilapia piscidin 3 (TP3) to GBM8401, U87MG, and T98G cells. The cellular assays and microscopic observations showed that TP3 significantly attenuated cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. A live-cell video clip showed the inhibition of filopodia protrusions and cell attachment. Probing at the molecular levels showed that the proteolytic activities (from secretion), the mRNA and protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 were attenuated. This result strongly evidenced that both invasion and metastasis were inhibited, although metastatic GBM is rare. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of cell-mobilization regulators focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were decreased. Similar effects were observed in small GTPase (RAS), phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) and MAP kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), JNK, and p38. Overall, TP3 showed promising activities to prevent cell infiltration and metastasis through modulating the tumor microenvironment balance, suggesting that TP3 merits further development for use in GBM treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266797
"""Rai is a new regulator of neural progenitor migration and glioblastoma invasion.""","""The invasive nature of glioblastoma (GBM) is one important reason for treatment failure. GBM stem/progenitor cells retain the migratory ability of normal neural stem/progenitor cells and infiltrate the brain parenchyma. Here, we identify Rai (ShcC/N-Shc), a member of the family of Shc-like adaptor proteins, as a new regulator of migration of normal and cancer stem/progenitor cells. Rai is expressed in neurogenic areas of the brain and its knockdown impairs progenitor migration to the olfactory bulb. Its expression is retained in GBM stem/progenitor cells where it exerts the same promigratory activity. Rai silencing in cancer stem/progenitor cells isolated from different patients causes significant decrease in cell migration and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo, providing survival benefit. Rai depletion is associated with alteration of multiple-signaling pathways, yet it always leads to reduced expression of proinvasive genes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22311806

It is expressed in a variety of normal and neoplastic cells, including many types of epithelial and lymphoid examples. However, its function in glioblastomas remains elusive. Thus, in this study, radixin gene expression was first examined in the glioblastoma cells, then suppressed with a lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) method.We found that there were high levels of radixin expression in glioblastoma U251cells. Radixin shRNA caused down-regulation of radixin gene expression and when radixin-silenced cells were implanted into nude mice, tumor growth was significantly inhibited as compared to blank control cells or non- sense shRNA cells. In addition, microvessel density in the tumors was significantly reduced. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and E-cadherin were up-regulated in radixin- suppressed glioblastoma U251 cells. In contrast, MMP9 was down-regulated. Taken together, our findings suggest that radixin is involved in GBM cell migration and invasion, and implicate TSP-1, E-cadherin and MMP9 as metastasis-inducing factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25520109
"""Tweety-Homolog 1 Drives Brain Colonization of Gliomas.""","""Early and progressive colonization of the healthy brain is one hallmark of diffuse gliomas, including glioblastomas. We recently discovered ultralong (>10 to hundreds of microns) membrane protrusions [tumor microtubes (TMs)] extended by glioma cells. TMs have been associated with the capacity of glioma cells to effectively invade the brain and proliferate. Moreover, TMs are also used by some tumor cells to interconnect to one large, resistant multicellular network. Here, we performed a correlative gene-expression microarray and in vivo imaging analysis, and identified novel molecular candidates for TM formation and function. Interestingly, these genes were previously linked to normal CNS development. One of the genes scoring highest in tests related to the outgrowth of TMs was tweety-homolog 1 (TTYH1), which was highly expressed in a fraction of TMs in mice and patients. Ttyh1 was confirmed to be a potent regulator of normal TM morphology and of TM-mediated tumor-cell invasion and proliferation. Glioma cells with one or two TMs were mainly responsible for effective brain colonization, and Ttyh1 downregulation particularly affected this cellular subtype, resulting in reduced tumor progression and prolonged survival of mice. The remaining Ttyh1-deficient tumor cells, however, had more interconnecting TMs, which were associated with increased radioresistance in those small tumors. These findings imply a cellular and molecular heterogeneity in gliomas regarding formation and function of distinct TM subtypes, with multiple parallels to neuronal development, and suggest that Ttyh1 might be a promising target to specifically reduce TM-associated brain colonization by glioma cells in patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this report, we identify tweety-homolog 1 (Ttyh1), a membrane protein linked to neuronal development, as a potent driver of tumor microtube (TM)-mediated brain colonization by glioma cells. Targeting of Ttyh1 effectively inhibited the formation of invasive TMs and glioma growth, but increased network formation by intercellular TMs, suggesting a functional and molecular heterogeneity of the recently discovered TMs with potential implications for future TM-targeting strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28607172

"""Astrocytes enhance the invasion potential of glioblastoma stem-like cells.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized as highly invasive; the contribution of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) to the invasive phenotype, however, has not been completely defined. Towards this end, we have defined the invasion potential of CD133+ GSCs and their differentiated CD133- counterparts grown under standard in vitro conditions and in co-culture with astrocytes. Using a trans-well assay, astrocytes or astrocyte conditioned media in the bottom chamber significantly increased the invasion of GSCs yet had no effect on CD133- cells. In addition, a monolayer invasion assay showed that the GSCs invaded farther into an astrocyte monolayer than their differentiated progeny. Gene expression profiles were generated from two GSC lines grown in trans-well culture with astrocytes in the bottom chamber or directly in contact with astrocyte monolayers. In each co-culture model, genes whose expression was commonly increased in both GSC lines involved cell movement and included a number of genes that have been previously associated with tumor cell invasion. Similar gene expression modifications were not detected in CD133- cells co-cultured under the same conditions with astrocytes. Finally, evaluation of the secretome of astrocytes grown in monolayer identified a number of chemokines and cytokines associated with tumor cell invasion. These data suggest that astrocytes enhance the invasion of CD133+ GSCs and provide additional support for a critical role of brain microenvironment in the regulation of GBM biology.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23349962
"""Caffeine-mediated inhibition of calcium release channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor subtype 3 blocks glioblastoma invasion and extends survival.""","""Calcium signaling is important in many signaling processes in cancer cell proliferation and motility including in deadly glioblastomas of the brain that aggressively invade neighboring tissue. We hypothesized that disturbing Ca(2+) signaling pathways might decrease the invasive behavior of giloblastoma, extending survival. Evaluating a panel of small-molecule modulators of Ca(2+) signaling, we identified caffeine as an inhibitor of glioblastoma cell motility. Caffeine, which is known to activate ryanodine receptors, paradoxically inhibits Ca(2+) increase by inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate receptor subtype 3 (IP(3)R3), the expression of which is increased in glioblastoma cells. Consequently, by inhibiting IP(3)R3-mediated Ca(2+) release, caffeine inhibited migration of glioblastoma cells in various in vitro assays. Consistent with these effects, caffeine greatly increased mean survival in a mouse xenograft model of glioblastoma. These findings suggest IP(3)R3 as a novel therapeutic target and identify caffeine as a possible adjunct therapy to slow invasive growth of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20103623
"""Migration of mesenchymal stem cells towards glioblastoma cells depends on hepatocyte-growth factor and is enhanced by aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic treatment.""","""Hepatocyte-growth factor (HGF) is expressed by glioblastomas and contributes to their growth, migration and invasion. HGF also mediates migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to sites of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, MSC show tropism for glioblastomas, which is exploited in gene therapy to deliver the therapeutics to the tumor cells. Here, we have studied whether HGF contributes to the recruitment of MSC by glioblastoma cells and whether aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (ALA/PDT), a novel therapeutic approach that induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, affects HGF release and this migratory response. MSC expressed the HGF receptor MET and migrated towards U87 and U251 glioblastoma spheroids. Migration increased significantly when spheroids were subjected to ALA/PDT, which was associated with induction of apoptosis and up-regulation of HGF. Neutralizing HGF resulted in significant inhibition of MSC migration towards untreated as well as ALA/PDT-treated spheroids. Thus, glioblastoma cells express HGF, which contributes to the attraction of MSC. ALA/PDT induces apoptosis and augments HGF release causing enhanced MSC migration towards the tumor cells. ALA/PDT may therefore be exploited to improve targeting of MSC delivered gene therapy, but it may also constitute a risk in terms of beneficial effects for the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333382
"""Classification of microvascular patterns via cluster analysis reveals their prognostic significance in glioblastoma.""","""There are limited researches focusing on microvascular patterns (MVPs) in human glioblastoma and their prognostic impact. We evaluated MVPs of 78 glioblastomas by CD34/periodic acid-Schiff dual staining and by cluster analysis of the percentage of microvascular area for distinct microvascular formations. The distribution of 5 types of basic microvascular formations, that is, microvascular sprouting (MS), vascular cluster (VC), vascular garland (VG), glomeruloid vascular proliferation (GVP), and vasculogenic mimicry (VM), was variable. Accordingly, cluster analysis classified MVPs into 2 types: type I MVP displayed prominent MSs and VCs, whereas type II MVP had numerous VGs, GVPs, and VMs. By analyzing the proportion of microvascular area for each type of formation, we determined that glioblastomas with few MSs and VCs had many GVPs and VMs, and vice versa. VG seemed to be a transitional type of formation. In case of type I MVP, expression of Ki-67 and p53 but not MGMT was significantly higher as compared with those of type II MVP (P < .05). Survival analysis showed that the type of MVPs presented as an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (both P < .001). Type II MVP had a more negative influence on PFS and OS than did type I MVP.

"""CBF1 is clinically prognostic and serves as a target to block cellular invasion and chemoresistance of EMT-like glioblastoma cells.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and most lethal primary brain cancer. CBF1 (also known as Recombination signal Binding Protein for immunoglobulin kappa J, RBPJ) is the cardinal transcriptional regulator of the Notch signalling network and has been shown to promote cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma. Recent studies suggest that some of the malignant properties of CSCs are mediated through the activation of pro-invasive programme of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Little is known whether CBF1 is involved in the EMT-like phenotype of glioma cells. Methods: In a collection of GBM neurosphere lines, we genetically inhibited CBF1 and investigated the consequences on EMT-related properties, including in vitro invasiveness by Boyden chambers assay, chemoresistance using a clinical drug library screen and glycolytic metabolism assessing live-cell extracellular acidification rate. We also compared CBF1 expression in cells exposed to low and high oxygen tension. In silico analysis in large-scale Western and Eastern patient cohorts investigated the clinical prognostic value of CBF1 expression in low- and high-grade glioma as well as medulloblastoma. Results: Mean CBF1 expression is significantly increased in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) R132H mutant glioblastoma and serves as prognostic marker for prolonged overall survival in brain tumours, particularly after therapy with temozolomide. Hypoxic regions of glioblastoma have higher CBF1 activation and exposure to low oxygen can induce its expression in glioma cells in vitro. CBF1 inhibition blocks EMT activators such as zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and significantly reduces cellular invasion and resistance to clinically approved anticancer drugs. Moreover, we indicate that CBF1 inhibition can impede cellular glycolysis. Conclusions: Mean CBF1 activation in bulk tumour samples serves as a clinical predictive biomarker in brain cancers but its intratumoral and intertumoral expression is highly heterogeneous. Microenvironmental changes such as hypoxia can stimulate the activation of CBF1 in glioblastoma. CBF1 blockade can suppress glioblastoma invasion in vitro in particular in cells undergone EMT such as those found in the hypoxic niche. Targeting CBF1 can be an effective anti-EMT therapy to impede invasive properties and chemosensitivity in those cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28571041

The high proliferative and invasive nature of GB, as well as its acquired resistance to chemotherapy, makes this type of cancer extremely lethal shortly after diagnosis. Long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNA) are a class of regulatory RNAs whose levels can be dysregulated in the context of diseases, unbalancing several physiological processes. The lncRNA associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (lncRNA-MVIH), overexpressed in several cancers, was described to co-precipitate with phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), preventing secretion of this enzyme to the extracellular environment and promoting cell migration and invasion. We hypothesized that, by silencing the expression of lncRNA-MVIH, the secretion of PGK1 would increase, reducing GB cell migration and invasion capabilities. We observed that lncRNA-MVIH silencing in human GB cells significantly decreased glycolysis, cell growth, migration, and invasion and sensitized GB cells to cediranib. However, no increase in extracellular PGK1 was observed as a consequence of lncRNA-MVIH silencing, and therefore, we investigated the possibility of a mechanism of miRNA sponge of lncRNA-MVIH being in place. We found that the levels of miR-302a loaded onto RISC increased in GB cells after lncRNA-MVIH silencing, with the consequent downregulation of several miR-302a molecular targets. Our findings suggest a new mechanism of action of lncRNA-MVIH as a sponge of miR-302a.

There was a significant, dose-related decrease of glioblastoma cell proliferation and a tendency to downregulation of SPARC at the protein level 72 h after 10 micromol/l Ukrain, suggesting the drug may be a useful therapeutic tool for brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16428937
"""Inhibition of glioma invasion of fetal brain aggregates.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant primary brain tumor associated with short patient survival in part because of the ability of individual cells to migrate significant distances into brain tissue. Invasion is a difficult process to model, because many such human tumors do not invade immunologically competent animal tissue, tumors grown in animals do not invade human tissue, and relevant human tissue substrates are not easily reproduced. We discuss models for examining invasion in vitro, and in particular review work using the tumor spheroid--fetal rat brain aggregate co-culture model, assessed with confocal microscopy and four-dimensional imaging. Quantitation of invasion in this model is discussed, as well as the invasion-inhibitory properties of tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors. The effects of receptor-specific tyrphostins strongly support a dominant role for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor activation in this process and show that invasion can be effectively inhibited at much lower concentrations of TK inhibitors than is necessary for growth suppression. Inhibition of activation of the purported growth factor receptor second messenger phospholipase C- gamma 1, by pharmacological means and gene transfection, also profoundly inhibits the invasive properties of human glioblastoma and rat C6 glioma cells.

We also explained the fundamental molecular processes of glioblastoma migration and invasion in which PKCzeta is a participant. The silence of PKCzeta expression likewise impaired the phosphorylation of LIN-11, Isl1 and MEC-3 protein domain kinase (LIMK) and cofilin, which is a critical step in cofilin recycling and actin polymerization. Consistent with the defects in cell adhesion, phosphorylation of integrin beta1 was also dampened. Therefore, PKCzeta regulated both cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell adhesion, which contributed to cell migration. Additionally, there was down-regulation of matrix metalloprotease-9 expression in siPKCzeta/LN-229 cells, which coincided with decreased invasion both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that PKCzeta is involved in the control of glioblastoma cell migration and invasion by regulating the cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell adhesion, and matrix metalloprotease-9 expression.

Therefore, in order to better treat these tumors, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms which are responsible for this behavior. Previous work suggested that gap junction proteins, the connexins, facilitate the aggressive nature of glioma cells. Here, we show that one of them-connexin43 (Cx43)-is implicated in the formation and function of invadopodia responsible for invasion capacity of U251 human glioblastoma cells. Immunofluorescent approaches-combined with confocal analyses-revealed that Cx43 was detected in all the formation stages of invadopodia exhibiting proteolytic activity. Clearly, Cx43 appeared to be localized in invadopodia at low cell density and less associated with the establishment of gap junctions. Accordingly, lower extracellular matrix degradation correlated with less mature invadopodia and MMP2 activity when Cx43 expression was decreased by shRNA strategies. Moreover, the kinetics of invadopodia formation could be dependent on Cx43 dynamic interactions with partners including Src and cortactin.

The integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of glioblastoma cells on brain matrix proteins is enhanced by stimulation with growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). As focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, has been shown to promote cell migration in various other cell types, we analysed its role in glioblastoma cell migration. Forced overexpression of FAK in serum-starved glioblastoma cells plated on recombinant (rec)-osteopontin resulted in a twofold enhancement of basal migration and a ninefold enhancement of PDGF-BB-stimulated migration. Both expression of mutant FAK(397F) and the downregulation of FAK with small interfering (si) RNA inhibited basal and PDGF-stimulated migration. FAK overexpression and PDGF stimulation was found to increase the phosphorylation of the Crk-associated substrate (CAS) family member human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1), but not p130CAS or Src-interacting protein (Sin)/Efs, although the levels of expression of these proteins was similar. Moreover downregulation of HEF1 with siRNA, but not p130CAS, inhibited basal and PDGF-stimulated migration. The phosphorylated HEF1 colocalized with vinculin and was associated almost exclusively with 0.1% Triton X-100 insoluble material, consistent with its signaling at focal adhesions. FAK overexpression promoted invasion through normal brain homogenate and siHEF1 inhibited this invasion.

Historically, anti-invasion strategies focused upon mDia inhibition, whereas activation remained unexplored. The recent development of small molecules directly inhibiting or activating mDia-driven F-actin assembly that supports motility allows for exploration of their role in GBM. We used the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 and mDia agonists IMM-01/-02 and mDia2-DAD peptides, which disrupt autoinhibition, to examine the roles of mDia inactivation versus activation in GBM cell migration and invasion in vitro and in an ex vivo brain slice invasion model. Inhibiting mDia suppressed directional migration and spheroid invasion while preserving intrinsic random migration. mDia agonism abrogated both random intrinsic and directional migration and halted U87 spheroid invasion in ex vivo brain slices. Thus mDia agonism is a superior GBM anti-invasion strategy. We conclude that formin agonism impedes the most dangerous GBM component-tumor spread into surrounding healthy tissue. Formin activation impairs novel aspects of transformed cells and informs the development of anti-GBM invasion strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26354425
"""Glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-Glucose activates migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells through modulation of the miR-7-5p/TFF3 signaling pathway.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by the metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis, rapid proliferation and acquisition of the migratory and invasive phenotype aiding tumor angiogenesis. The glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) used for targeting glycolysis in GBMs is ineffective in inhibiting migration and invasion. In the present study we report that 2-DG treatment downregulates the tumor suppressive miR-7-5p in GBM cell lines in vitro. Overexpression of miR-7-5p significantly reduced migration and invasion in GBM cell lines. The 2-DG induced suppression of miR-7-5p in turn activated the PI3K/Akt signaling activator Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) in GBM cell lines. TFF3 was found to be upregulated in cell lines and clinical samples and its genomic inhibition significantly decreased migration and invasion in GBM cell lines either alone or in combination with 2-DG. Collectively, our results provide the molecular basis for the limited efficacy of 2-DG monotherapy and underscores the significance of the miR-7-5p/TFF3 signaling pathway in the regulation of migration and invasion in 2-DG treated GBM cell lines.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29621542
"""The role of integrins in glioma biology and anti-glioma therapies.""","""The tumor environment is critical for tumor maintenance and progression. Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors mediating the interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment and play important roles in glioma biology, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor stem cell anchorage. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data on integrin inhibition in malignant gliomas. Various pharmacological approaches to the modulation of integrin signaling have been explored including antibodies and peptide-based agents. Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma. Cilengitide had only limited activity as a single agent in glioblastoma, but, when added to standard radiochemotherapy, appeared to prolong progression-free and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas and methylation of the promoter of the Oâ¶ methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT gene promoter methylation in turn predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy. A phase III randomized clinical trial in conjunction with standard radiochemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with MGMT gene promoter methylation has recently completed accrual (EORTC 26071-22072). A companion trial explores a dose-escalated regimen of cilengitide added to radiotherapy plus temozolomide in patients without MGMT gene promoter methylation. Promising results in these trials would probably result in a broader interest in integrins as targets for glioma therapy and hopefully the development of a broader panel of anti-integrin agents.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21827415
"""Coordination of signalling networks and tumorigenic properties by ABL in glioblastoma cells.""","""The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ABL exerts positive or negative effects in solid tumours according to the cellular context, thus functioning as a 'switch modulator'. The therapeutic effects of drugs targeting a set of signals encompassing ABL have been explored in several solid tumours. However, the net contribution of ABL inhibition by these agents remains elusive as these drugs also act on other signalling components. Here, using glioblastoma (GBM) as a cellular paradigm, we report that ABL inhibition exacerbates mesenchymal features as highlighted by down-regulation of epithelial markers and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers. Cells with permanent ABL inhibition exhibit enhanced motility and invasive capabilities, while proliferation and tumorigenic properties are reduced. Intriguingly, permanent ABL inhibition also interferes with GBM neurosphere formation and with expression of stemness markers in sphere-cultured GBM cells. Furthermore, we show that the molecular and biological characteristics of GBM cells with impaired ABL are reversible by restoring ABL levels, thus uncovering a remarkable plasticity of GBM cells to ABL threshold. A phospho-signalling screen revealed that loss of tumorigenic and self-renewal properties in GBM cells under permanent ABL inhibition coincide with drastic changes in the expression and/or phosphorylation levels of multiple signalling components. Our findings identify ABL as a crucial player for migration, invasion, proliferation, tumorigenic, and stem-cell like properties of GBM cells. Taken together, this work supports the notion that the oncogenic role of ABL in GBM cells is associated with its capability to coordinate a signalling setting that determines tumorigenic and stem-cell like properties.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27732969
"""High expression of CXCR3 is an independent prognostic factor in glioblastoma patients that promotes an invasive phenotype.""","""Chemokines are a superfamily of small heparin-binding cytokines that induce leukocytes to migrate to sites of inflammation or injury through interacting with specific transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Currently, attention is focused on chemokine/chemokine receptor pairs and their ability to promote tumor cell migration and angiogenesis. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is involved in tumor metastasis and is used as a prognostic biomarker. However, its relationship with the clinicopathological features of primary glioblastoma multiforme (pGBM) and its potential prognostic value have yet to be investigated. Here, we report that high CXCR3 expression conferred poor survival in pGBM patients. Further analysis showed that CXCR3 served as an independent prognostic biomarker for pGBM patients. In addition, functional assays indicated that CXCR3 induced glioma cell invasion. Therefore, this evidence indicates CXCR3 is an independent prognostic factor for pGBM patients and promotes an invasive phenotype, which suggests a new potential biotarget for glioblastoma multiforme therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527046
"""Distinct transcription profiles of primary and secondary glioblastoma subgroups.""","""Glioblastomas are invasive and aggressive tumors of the brain, generally considered to arise from glial cells. A subset of these cancers develops from lower-grade gliomas and can thus be clinically classified as 'secondary,' whereas some glioblastomas occur with no prior evidence of a lower-grade tumor and can be clinically classified as 'primary.' Substantial genetic differences between these groups of glioblastomas have been identified previously. We used large-scale expression analyses to identify glioblastoma-associated genes (GAG) that are associated with a more malignant phenotype via comparison with lower-grade astrocytomas. We have further defined gene expression differences that distinguish primary and secondary glioblastomas. GAGs distinct to primary or secondary tumors provided information on the heterogeneous properties and apparently distinct oncogenic mechanisms of these tumors. Secondary GAGs primarily include mitotic cell cycle components, suggesting the loss of function in prominent cell cycle regulators, whereas primary GAGs highlight genes typical of a stromal response, suggesting the importance of extracellular signaling. Immunohistochemical staining of glioblastoma tissue arrays confirmed expression differences. These data highlight that the development of gene pathway-targeted therapies may need to be specifically tailored to each subtype of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16397228
"""Marked genomic differences characterize primary and secondary glioblastoma subtypes and identify two distinct molecular and clinical secondary glioblastoma entities.""","""Glioblastoma is classified into two subtypes on the basis of clinical history: 'primary glioblastoma' arising de novo without detectable antecedent disease and 'secondary glioblastoma' evolving from a low-grade astrocytoma. Despite their distinctive clinical courses, they arrive at an indistinguishable clinical and pathologic end point highlighted by widespread invasion and resistance to therapy and, as such, are managed clinically as if they are one disease entity. Because the life history of a cancer cell is often reflected in the pattern of genomic alterations, we sought to determine whether primary and secondary glioblastomas evolve through similar or different molecular pathogenetic routes. Clinically annotated primary and secondary glioblastoma samples were subjected to high-resolution copy number analysis using oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization. Unsupervised classification using genomic nonnegative matrix factorization methods identified three distinct genomic subclasses. Whereas one corresponded to clinically defined primary glioblastomas, the remaining two stratified secondary glioblastoma into two genetically distinct cohorts. Thus, this global genomic analysis showed wide-scale differences between primary and secondary glioblastomas that were previously unappreciated, and has shown for the first time that secondary glioblastoma is heterogeneous in its molecular pathogenesis. Consistent with these findings, analysis of regional recurrent copy number alterations revealed many more events unique to these subclasses than shared. The pathobiological significance of these shared and subtype-specific copy number alterations is reinforced by their frequent occurrence, resident genes with clear links to cancer, recurrence in diverse cancer types, and apparent association with clinical outcome. We conclude that glioblastoma is composed of at least three distinct molecular subtypes, including novel subgroups of secondary glioblastoma, which may benefit from different therapeutic strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17114236
"""IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.""","""Purpose: Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a new diagnostic approach allowing the visualization of tumor stroma. Here, we applied FAP-specific PET imaging to gliomas. We analyzed the target affinity and specificity of two FAP ligands (FAPI-02 and FAPI-04) in vitro, and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice in vivo. Clinically, we used 68Ga-labeled FAPI-02/04 for PET imaging in 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas, 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). Methods: For binding studies with 177Lu-radiolabeled FAPI-02/04, we used the glioblastoma cell line U87MG, FAP-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, and CD26-transfected human embryonic kidney cells. For pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies, U87MG-xenografted mice were injected with 68Ga-labeled compounds followed by small-animal PET imaging and 177Lu-labeled FAPI-02/04, respectively. Clinical PET/CT scans were performed 30 min post intravenous administration of 68Ga-FAPI-02/04. PET and MRI scans were co-registrated. Immunohistochemistry was done on 14 gliomas using a FAP-specific antibody. Results: FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 showed high binding specificity to FAP. FAPI-04 demonstrated higher tumor accumulation and delayed elimination compared with FAPI-02 in preclinical studies. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV, but not grade II, IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake. In glioblastomas, we observed spots with increased uptake in projection on contrast-enhancing areas. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-positive cells with mainly elongated cell bodies and perivascular FAP-positive cells in glioblastomas and an anaplastic IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Conclusions: Using FAP-specific PET imaging, increased tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytomas, but not in diffuse astrocytomas, may allow non-invasive distinction between low-grade IDH-mutant and high-grade gliomas. Therefore, FAP-specific imaging in gliomas may be useful for follow-up studies although further clinical evaluation is required.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31388723
"""PBX3/MEK/ERK1/2/LIN28/let-7b positive feedback loop enhances mesenchymal phenotype to promote glioblastoma migration and invasion.""","""Background: Brain invasion by glioblastoma (GBM) determines recurrence and prognosis in patients, which is, in part, attributed to increased mesenchymal transition. Here, we report evidence favoring such a role for the Pre-B-cell leukemia homebox (PBX) family member PBX3. Methods: Western blot, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and datasets mining were used to determined proteins or genes expression levels. Wound-healing and transwell assays were used to examine the invasive abilities of GBM cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine how let-7b regulates PBX3. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and rescue experiments were performed to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms. Orthotopic mouse models were used to assess the role of PBX3 in vivo. Results: We found that PBX3 expression levels positively correlated with glioma mesenchymal markers. Ectopic expression of PBX3 promoted invasive phenotypes and triggered the expression of mesenchymal markers, whereas depletion of PBX3 reduced GBM cell invasive abilities and decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers. In addition, inhibition of PBX3 attenuated transforming growth factor-Î² (TGFÎ²)-induced GBM mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies revealed that PBX3 mediated GBM mesenchymal transition through activation of MEK/ERK1/2, leading to increased expression of LIN28 by c-myc. Increased LIN28 inhibited let-7b biogenesis, which then promoted the pro-invasive genes, such as HMGA2 and IL-6. Furthermore, let-7b suppressed PBX3 by directly targeting 3'-UTR of PBX3. Thus, repressed let-7b by PBX3 amplifies PBX3 signaling and forms a positive feedback loop to promote GBM mesenchymal transition. Conclusions: These data highlight the importance of PBX3 as a key driver of mesenchymal transition and potential therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30016974
"""A Photopolymerizable Hyaluronic Acid-Collagen Model of the Invasive Glioma Microenvironment with Interstitial Flow.""","""Glioblastoma recurrence is a major hindrance to treatment success and is driven by the invasion of glioma stem cells (GSCs) into healthy tissue that are inaccessible to surgical resection and are resistant to existing chemotherapies.

We present an accessible method for replicating the invasive TME in glioblastoma: a hyaluronan-collagen I hydrogel composed of human GSCs, astrocytes, and microglia seeded in a tissue culture insert. Elevated IFF can be represented by applying a fluid pressure head to the hydrogel.

These data were correlated with patient survival using multivariable Cox analysis and, for a subset of 167 tumors, with signs of tumor invasiveness on the MRI. The effects of STAT5b knockdown by siRNA were assessed on the growth, therapeutic resistance, invasion and migration of GBM cell lines U87, U87âEGFRVIII and LN18 and primary cultures GM2 and GM3. The activation, but not the copy number or the mRNA expression of nuclear transcription factor STAT5b expression correlated inversely with patient survival independently of IDH1R132H status, age, Karnofsky Performance Score, treatment and tumor volume. STAT5b inhibition neither altered the cell proliferation nor reduced the clonogenic proliferative potency of GBM cells, and did not sensitize them to the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation and temozolomide in vitro. STAT5b inhibition significantly increased GBM cell migration, but decreased the invasion of some GBM cells in vitro. There was no correlation between the activation of STAT5b in clinical tumors and the extent of invasion on MRI OF patients. In conclusion, STAT5b is frequently activated in GBM and correlates inversely with patient survival. It does not contribute to the growth and resistance of these tumors, and is thus rather a potential prognostic marker than a therapeutic target in these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36069226
"""Na+/K+-ATPase beta2-subunit (AMOG) expression abrogates invasion of glioblastoma-derived brain tumor-initiating cells.""","""Background: Mechanisms of glioma invasion remain to be fully elucidated. Glioma cells within glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) range from well-differentiated tumor cells to less-differentiated brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). The Î²2-subunit of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, called the adhesion molecule on glia (AMOG), is highly expressed in normal glia but is thought to be universally downregulated in GBM. To test our hypothesis that expression of AMOG is heterogeneous in GBM and confers a less invasive phenotype, we compared it between BTICs and differentiated cells from patient-matched GBM and then tested GBM invasion in vitro after AMOG overexpression. Methods: Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and real-time PCR were used to characterize AMOG protein and mRNA expression in tumor samples, BTICs, and differentiated cells. Matrigel invasion assay, scratch assay, and direct cell counting were used for testing in vitro invasion, migration, and proliferation, respectively. Results: While AMOG expression is heterogeneous in astrocytomas of grades II-IV, it is lost in most GBM. BTICs express higher levels of AMOG mRNA and protein compared with patient-matched differentiated tumor cells. Overexpression of AMOG decreased GBM cell and BTIC invasion without affecting migration or proliferation. Knockdown of AMOG expression in normal human astrocytes increased invasion. Conclusions: AMOG expression inhibits GBM invasion. Its downregulation increases invasion in glial cells and may also represent an important step in BTIC differentiation. These data provide compelling evidence implicating the role of AMOG in glioma invasion and provide impetus for further investigation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23887941
"""Viscumins functionally modulate cell motility-associated gene expression.""","""In Europe extracts from Viscum album L., the European white-berry mistletoe, are widely used as a complementary cancer therapy. Viscumins (mistletoe lectins, ML) have been scrutinized as important active components of mistletoe and exhibit a variety of anticancer effects such as stimulation of the immune system, induction of cytotoxicity, reduction of tumor cell motility as well as changes in the expression of genes associated with cancer development and progression. By microarray expression analysis, quantitative RT-PCR and RT-PCR based validation of microarray data we demonstrate for the Viscum album extract Iscador Qu and for the lectins Aviscumine and ML-1 that in glioma cells these drugs differentially modulate the expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion, including processes modulating cell architecture and cell adhesion. A variety of differentially expressed genes in ML treated cells are associated with the transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² signaling pathway or are targets of TGF-Î². ML treatment downregulated the expression of TGF-Î² itself, of the TGF-Î² receptor II (TGFBR2), of the TGF-Î² intracellular signal transducer protein SMAD2, and of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP) MMP-2 and MMP-14. Even if the changes in gene expression differ between Aviscumine, Iscador Qu and ML-1, the overall regulation of motility associated gene expression by all drugs showed functional effects since tumor cell motility was reduced in a ML-dependent manner.

Obviously, therefore, a better therapeutic strategy is needed. Resveratrol has been reported to be one of the most potent chemopreventive agents inhibiting the cellular processes associated with tumor development, including initiation, promotion, and progression. Materials and methods: In this study we used RT-PCR, western blot and SDS-zymography to investigate the effect of resveratrol on the expression of genes and proteins involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling associated with tumor invasion in human cultured glioblastoma cells treated for 24, 48 and 72 h.

Results: Our results show a dose-related decrease of MMP-2 mRNA and protein levels 72 h after resveratrol treatment, and lower SPARC gene and protein expression 72 h after resveratrol treatment.

"""TGF-beta is an inducer of ZEB1-dependent mesenchymal transdifferentiation in glioblastoma that is associated with tumor invasion.""","""Different molecular subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM) have been recently identified, of which the mesenchymal subtype is associated with worst prognoses. Here, we report that transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) is able to induce a mesenchymal phenotype in GBM that involves activation of SMAD2 and ZEB1, a known transcriptional inducer of mesenchymal transition in epithelial cancers. TGF-Î² exposure of established and newly generated GBM cell lines was associated with morphological changes, enhanced mesenchymal marker expression, migration and invasion in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model. TGF-Î²-induced mesenchymal differentiation and invasive behavior was prevented by chemical inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA)-dependent silencing of ZEB1. Furthermore, TGF-Î²-responding and -nonresponding GBM neurospheres were identified in vitro. Interestingly, nonresponding cells displayed already high levels of pSMAD2 and ZEB1 that could not be suppressed by inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling, suggesting the involvement of yet unknown mechanisms. These different GBM neurospheres formed invasive tumors in mice as well as revealed mesenchymal marker expression in immunohistochemical analyses. Moreover, we also detected distinct zones with overlapping pSMAD2, elevated ZEB1 and mesenchymal marker expression in GBM patient material, suggestive of the induction of local, microenvironment-dependent mesenchymal differentiation. Overall, our findings indicate that GBM cells can acquire mesenchymal features associated with enhanced invasive potential following stimulation by secretory cytokines, such as TGF-Î². This property of GBM contributes to heterogeneity in this tumor type and may blur the boundaries between the proposed transcriptional subtypes. Targeting TGF-Î² or downstream targets like ZEB1 might be of potential benefit in reducing the invasive phenotype of GBM in a subpopulation of patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25275602
"""4-Hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenoic acid lactone is a potent inducer of brain cancer cell invasiveness that may contribute to the failure of anti-angiogenic therapies.""","""Previously, we discovered that free radical-induced oxidative fragmentation of the docosahexaenoate ester of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine produces 4-hydroxy-7-oxo-5-heptenoic acid (HOHA) lactone that, in turn, promotes the migration and invasion of endothelial cells. This suggested that HOHA lactone might similarly promote migration and invasion of glioblastoma multiformae (GBM) brain cancer stem cells (CSCs). A bioinformatics analysis of clinical cancer genomic data revealed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 and three markers of oxidative stress - superoxide dismutase 2, NADPH oxidase 4, and carbonic anhydrase 9 - are upregulated in human mesenchymal GBM cancer tissue, and that MMP1 is positively correlated to all three of these oxidative stress markers. In addition, elevated levels of MMP1 are indicative of GBM invasion, while low levels of MMP1 indicate survival. We also explored the hypothesis that the transition from the proneural to the more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, e.g., after treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy, is promoted by the effects of lipid oxidation products on GBM CSCs. We found that low micromolar concentrations of HOHA lactone increase the cell migration velocity of cultured GBM CSCs, and induce the expression of MMP1 and two protein biomarkers of the proneural to mesenchymal transition (PMT): p65 NF-ÎºÎ² and vimentin. Exposure of cultured GBM CSCs to HOHA lactone causes an increase in phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt kinases that are dependent on both protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and MMP1 activity. We conclude that HOHA lactone promotes the PMT in GBM through the activation of PAR1 and MMP1. This contributes to a fatal flaw in antiangiogenic, chemo, and radiation therapies: they promote oxidative stress and the generation of HOHA lactone in the tumor that fosters a change from the proliferative proneural to the migratory mesenchymal GBM CSC phenotype that seeds new tumor growth. Inhibition of PAR1 and HOHA lactone are potential new therapeutic targets for impeding GBM tumor recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31715381

It is abundantly expressed in immune cells of myeloid origin and appears to mediate cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling. Based on an analysis showing earlier mortality among glioblastoma patients whose tumors highly express EMR2, we studied its expression patterns in glioblastoma and potential to mediate cellular proliferation and invasion. We performed univariate analysis of overall survival in GBM patients expressing low, moderate, and high amounts of EMR2 based on publicly available microarray data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using RT-PCR and western blotting, we studied mRNA and protein expression patterns of EMR2, respectively. We then employed siRNA knockdown of EMR2 in two human glioblastoma cell lines expressing high levels of EMR2 to assess functional effects on cellular proliferation and invasion, in vitro. Kaplan-Meier analysis of TCGA survival data for GBM demonstrated that EMR2 levels are inversely correlated with overall time until mortality (log rank, P < 0.01). EMR2 mRNA and protein is variably expressed in primary glioblastoma samples and human glioblastoma cell lines. When comparing cells transfected with siRNA targeting EMR2 to those transfected with a negative, scramble control, there was no difference in proliferation over 72 h in the SF767 and G55 glioblastoma cell lines. However, EMR2 knockout cells demonstrated an almost 3-fold reduction in migration compared to their negative controls (P < 0.05) in the SF767 cell line, and an almost 2-fold reduction (P < 0.05) in migration in the G55 cell line. We provide evidence that EMR2 is expressed in glioblastoma and has significant functional consequences on cellular invasion, but not proliferation. In light of its ability to promote adhesion and migration in immune cells, our data suggest that EMR2 may mediate similar phenomena in glioblastoma. The invasive phenotype conferred by EMR2 correlates with clinical data demonstrating poor survival in glioblastoma patients who express high levels of EMR2 in their tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21503828

We analyzed published data and identified the invasion and motility pathways most frequently altered in GBM. These were most notably the focal adhesion and integrin signaling, and extracellular matrix interactions pathways. We mapped alterations in each of these pathways and found that they included the catalytic PIK3CA and regulatory PIK3R1 subunit genes of the class IA PI3K. Knockdown of either of these genes separately in GBM cell lines by lentiviral-mediated shRNA expression resulted in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion in all lines tested. FAK activity was reduced by knockdown of either PIK3CA or PIK3R1, and MMP2 levels were reduced by knockdown of PIK3R1.

EGFR overexpression correlates in experimental gliomas with increased angiogenesis, edema, and invasion. No radiographic predictors of molecular glioblastoma subtype are known. Experimental design: We retrospectively reviewed 75 glioblastomas, classified as TP53-mutated (n=11), EGFR-amplified (n=31), or neither (non-TP53/non-EGFR; n=33). Four variables were derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging: (a) T2/T1, the ratio of T2-bright volume to enclosed T1-enhancing volume; (b) percentage of tumor volume that was necrosis; and (c and d) T1 and T2 border sharpness coefficients (BSC), the rates of change in grayscale intensity of adjacent 0.02-cm2 voxels traversing the anterior, posterior, and lateral borders on T1-enhanced and T2 images. Results and conclusions: Mean T2/T1 was 4.7 for EGFR-amplified glioblastomas, greater than that of TP53-mutated glioblastomas (2.3) or non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (2.6; P<0.00005). All four tumors with T2/T1>7.2 were EGFR-amplified; 0 of 15 with T2/T1<4.7 underwent gross total resection. The mean T2 BSC of EGFR-amplified glioblastomas was 33.7, less sharp (P<0.0000005) than TP53-mutated (72.2) and non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (81.2). All 15 glioblastomas with T2 BSC<30.8 were EGFR-amplified. Percentage necrosis and T1 BSC did not differ between glioblastoma subtypes. The increased T2/T1 ratio and decreased T2 BSC in EGFR-overexpressing tumors are the first radiographic distinctions described between glioblastoma molecular subtypes. These findings may reflect increased angiogenesis, edema, and/or invasion in EGFR-overexpressing tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16361543

In the previous study, elevated circ_0029426 was first observed in glioblastoma (GBM) tissues compared with normal tissues by circRNA microarray. Our aim is to study the function and mechanism of circ_0029426 in GBM. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect relative circ_0029426 expression in GBM tissue samples and cells. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the expression of circ_0029426 and clinical parameters.The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were analyzed to evaluate the link between circ_0029426 expression and the overall survival of patients with GBM. Loss/gain-of function experiments were performed to measure GBM cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Dual luciferase reporter assays were applied to detect the binding ability between circ_0029426 and miR-197. As a result, the circ_0029426 expression is tightly correlated with patients' clinical severity and prognosis. Functionally, circ_0029426 strikingly promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-197 was predicted and verified to be sponged by circ_0029426. More importantly, the oncogenic functions of circ_0029426 are partially attributed to its suppression on miR-197.

Uncontrolled cellular proliferation, lack of apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis are among the biologic processes that render these tumors both aggressive and difficult to treat. An understanding of the genetics and molecular events regulating these aggressive tumors is beginning to emerge, partly because of recent knowledge in genomics, gene expression analysis, and mouse tumor models. As a result, it is now generally accepted that brain tumors, particularly those arising from cells of glial lineage, result from stepwise accumulation of deleterious genetic alterations. Several genetic abnormalities have been described, and current research is aimed at elucidating their causal association with brain tumor formation and progression.

"""Modulation of MicroRNAs 34a and 21 Affects Viability, Senescence, and Invasion in Glioblastoma Multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive and invasive brain tumor. Current interventional strategies have been minimally successful. Three key characteristics of GBMs are (1) enhanced resistance to apoptosis, (2) increased proliferation rate, and (3) increased invasion potential, making them difficult to treat. MicroRNAs (miRs) have demonstrated beneficial therapeutic intervention; particularly miRs 34a and 21, which have been implicated in regulation of apoptosis, senescence, and invasion of GBM tumor cells. MiR21 is anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative, whereas miR34a is proapoptotic and an anti-invasive regulator in tumor cells. Our study investigates the effects of modulating both miR34a and miR21, in addition to comparing the two individual treatments. Using targeted cationic liposomes that bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we delivered miR34a and/or anti-sense oligonucleotide to miR21 (ASO21) to GBM tumor cell lines, U87MG and A172, in vitro. Our data demonstrate that co-delivery of miR34a and ASO21 results in enhanced reduction in viability and invasion, while increasing senescence in vitro. Additionally, there were significant decreases in pro-invasion and -proliferation gene markers, as well as an increase in pro-apoptotic markers. In vivo results demonstrate that the combination of miR34a and ASO21 reduced tumor volume and proliferation of the A172 tumor cells. Accumulation of rhodamine encapsulated EGFR-targeted cationic liposomes was observed throughout the primary tumor bed after systemic injection. To our knowledge, we are the first to modulate multiple miRs, while using a targeted cationic liposomal delivery for miR-based therapy. These results demonstrate a potential clinically relevant, miR therapeutic strategy for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345889
"""Evodiamine, a plant alkaloid, induces calcium/JNK-mediated autophagy and calcium/mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastomas, the most common primary gliomas, are characterized by increased invasion and difficult therapy. Major clinical medicines for treating gliomas merely extend the survival time for a number of months. Therefore, development of new agents against gliomas is important. Autophagy, a process for degrading damaged organelles and proteins, is an adaptive response to environmental stress. However, the role of autophagy in glioblastoma development still needs to be further investigated. Evodiamine, a major alkaloid isolated from Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, has various pharmacological activities, such as inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic properties. However, the effects of evodiamine on glioblastomas and their detailed molecular mechanisms and autophagy formation are not well understood. In this study, we observed that evodiamine induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in glioma cells. Blockade of calcium channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) significantly reduced evodiamine-induced cytosolic calcium elevation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial depolarization, which suggests that evodiamine induces a calcium-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, autophagy was also enhanced by evodiamine, and had reached a plateau by 24h. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Inhibition of ER calcium channel activation also significantly reduced evodiamine-induced autophagy. Inactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) suppressed evodiamine-mediated autophagy accompanied by increased apoptosis. Furthermore, evodiamine-mediated JNK activation was abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium scavenger, suggesting that evodiamine mediates autophagy via a calcium-JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that evodiamine induces intracellular calcium/JNK signaling-mediated autophagy and calcium/mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774672

In this work, we explore Glioblastoma heterogeneity and recapitulate its invasive patterns both in vitro, by utilizing primary cells along with the U87MG cell line, and in silico, by adopting discrete, individual cell-based mathematics. Glioblastoma cells are cultured three-dimensionally in an ECM-like substrate. The primary Glioblastoma spheroids adopt a novel cohesive pattern, mimicking perivascular invasion in the brain, while the U87MG adopt a typical, starburst invasive pattern under the same experimental setup. Mathematically, we focus on the role of the intrinsic heterogeneity with respect to cell-to-cell adhesion. Our proposed mathematical approach mimics the invasive morphologies observed in vitro and predicts the dynamics of tumour expansion. The role of the proliferation and migration is also explored showing that their effect on tumour morphology is different per cell type. The proposed model suggests that allowing cell-to-cell adhesive heterogeneity within the tumour population is sufficient for variable invasive morphologies to emerge which remain originally undetectable by conventional imaging, indicating that exploration in pathological samples is needed to improve our understanding and reveal potential patient-specific therapeutic targets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385804
"""Cellular and in vivo activity of a novel PI3K inhibitor, PX-866, against human glioblastoma.""","""The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt oncogenic pathway is critical in glioblastomas. Loss of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway or activated PI3K/Akt pathway that drive increased proliferation, survival, neovascularization, glycolysis, and invasion is found in 70%-80% of malignant gliomas. Thus, PI3K is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant glioma. We report that a new irreversible PI3K inhibitor, PX-866, shows potent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma. PX-866 did not induce any apoptosis in glioma cells; however, an increase in autophagy was observed. PX-866 inhibited the invasive and angiogenic capabilities of cultured glioblastoma cells. In vivo, PX-866 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and increased the median survival time of animals with intracranial tumors. We also assessed the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a noninvasive method to monitor response to PX-866. Our findings show that PX-866 treatment causes a drop in the MRS-detectable choline-to-NAA, ratio and identify this partial normalization of the tumor metabolic profile as a biomarker of molecular drug action. Our studies affirm that the PI3K pathway is a highly specific molecular target for therapies for glioblastoma and other cancers with aberrant PI3K/PTEN expression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20156803
"""ell clusters isolation in glioblastomas and their functional and molecular characterization using new morphometric approaches.""","""Background: Digital pathology has come a long way in terms of creating tools to improve existing diagnostic approaches. However, several pathology fields, such as neuropathology, are still characterized by low coverage from machine learning tools and neural network analysis, which may be due to the complexity of the internal cellular and molecular structure of the corresponding neoplasms, including glioblastomas. Method: In the framework of this study, using advanced proprietary tools for obtaining images of histological slides and their deep morphometric analysis, we studied samples of 198 patients with glioblastoma with the selection of morphometric cell clusters. Also, cells of each cluster were isolated, and their proliferative, migratory, invasive activity, survival ability, aerobic glycolysis activity, and chemo- and radioresistance were studied. Results: Four morphometric clusters were identified, including small-cell cluster, paracirculonuclear cluster, hypochromic cluster, and macronuclear cluster, which significantly differed in morphometric parameters and functional parameters. Hypochromic cluster cells demonstrated the highest proliferation activity; macronuclear cluster was the most active glucose consumer; paracirculonuclear cluster had the most prominent migratory and invasive activity and hypoxia resistance; small-cell cluster demonstrated predominantly average values of all parameters. Moreover, additional analysis revealed the presence of a separate subcluster of stem cell elements that correspond in their molecular properties to glioma stem cells and are present in all four clusters. It also turned out that several key molecular parameters of glioblastoma, such as mutational modifications in the EGFR, PDGFRA, and NF1 genes, along with the molecular GBM subtype, are significantly correlated with the identified cell clusters.

"""Role of aquaporin-4 in the regulation of migration and invasion of human glioma cells.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor with a tendency to invade surrounding healthy brain tissues, rendering tumors of this type largely incurable. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a key molecule involved in maintaining water and ion homeostasis in the central nervous system and has been recently reported to play a role in cell migration in addition to its well-known function in brain edema. Increased AQP4 expression has been demonstrated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting that it is also involved in malignant brain tumors. Here, we identify a novel role for aquaporin-4 in glioblastoma cell migration and invasion. In the present study, we used small-interference RNA technology and a pharmacological inhibitor to knock down the expression of AQP4, which resulted in speciï¬c and massive impairment of glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated the possible mechanisms by which AQP4 functions in the process of glioblastoma cell invasion. The downregulation of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) expression in LN229 cells with AQP4 reduction coincided with decreased cell invasive ability. Furthermore, our study showed that AQP4 may also be involved in the regulation of glioblastoma cell adhesion. The expression of Î²-catenin and connexin 43 were increased in AQP4-downregulated LN229 cells consistent with their enhanced cell-cell adhesion ability. In summary, our results indicate that AQP4 is involved in the control of glioblastoma cell migration and invasion and may be a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma cell inï¬ltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21424125
"""Inhibition of glioblastoma growth in a highly invasive nude mouse model can be achieved by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor but not vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.""","""Purpose: Major shortcomings of traditional mouse models based on xenografted human glioblastoma cell lines are that tumor cells do not invade and that genetic alterations, such as amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, are not maintained. Such models are thus of limited value for preclinical studies. We established a highly invasive model to evaluate the effect of antibodies against EGFR (cetuximab) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (antibody DC101). Experimental design: After short-term culture, glioblastoma spheroids were implanted into the brains of nude mice. Animals were treated either i.c. with cetuximab or i.p. with DC101. Tumor burden was determined histologically using image analysis of 36 different landmark points on serial brain sections. Results: Invasive xenografts were obtained from nine different glioblastomas. Three of seven cases treated with cetuximab responded with significant tumor growth inhibition, whereas four did not. All responsive tumors were derived from glioblastomas exhibiting EGFR amplification and expression of the truncated EGFRvIII variant, which were maintained in the xenografts. All nonresponsive tumors lacked EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII expression. The proportion of apoptotic cells was increased, whereas proliferation and invasion were decreased in responsive tumors. None of four xenograft cases treated with DC101 responded to treatment, and the diffusely invading tumors grew independent of angiogenesis. Conclusions: Inhibition of glioblastoma growth and invasion can be achieved using i.c. delivery of an anti-EGFR antibody, but tumor response depends on the presence of amplified and/or mutated EGFR. Antiangiogenic treatment with DC101 is not effective against diffusely invading tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18765536
"""The self-organized structure of glioma oncostreams and the disruptive role of passive cells.""","""Oncostreams are self-organized structures formed by spindle-like, elongated, self-propelled cells recently described in glioblastomas and especially in gliosarcomas. Cells within these structures either move as large clusters in one main direction, flocks, or as linear, intermingling collections of cells advancing in opposite directions, streams. Round, passive cells are also observed, either inside or segregated from the oncostreams. Here we generalize a recently formulated particle-field approach to investigate the genesis and evolution of these structures, first showing that, in systems consisting only of identical self-propelled cells, both flocks and streams emerge as self-organized dynamic configurations. Flocks are the more stable configurations, while streams are transient and usually originate in collisions between flocks. Stream degradation is easier at low self-propulsion speeds. In systems consisting of both motile and passive cells, the latter block stream formation and accelerate their degradation and flock stabilization. Since the flock appears to be the most effective invasive structure, we thus argue that a phenotype mixture (motile and passive cells) may favor glioblastoma invasion. hlBy relating cellular properties to the observed outcome, our model shows that oncostreams are self-organized structures that result from the interplay between speed, shape, and steric repulsion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455622

"""Glioblastomas at the white matter of temporo-parietal junction cause a poor postoperative independence level.""","""Introduction: Right cerebral hemispheric glioblastomas (GBMs) often decrease the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score postoperatively, despite the patient having sufficient patient function while performing daily living. This study aimed to evaluate the factors that could cause poor KPS scores during the postoperative chronic phase in patients with right cerebral hemispheric GBMs. Methods: Data of 47 patients with newly diagnosed right cerebral hemispheric GBMs were analyzed. All patients were assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively to determine KPS and brain function. To determine tumor location related to the postoperative KPS scores, we used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). The patients were divided into two groups (involvement and non-involvement groups) based on whether their lesion involved a significant region identified by VLSM. We then compared functional factors and prognosis between the groups using the chi-squared and log-rank tests, respectively. Results: The KPS score significantly decreased after surgery compared to that preoperatively measured (p = 0.023). VLSM revealed that tumors in the white matter of temporo-parietal junction (WM-TPJ) caused a significant decline in the KPS score at three months postoperatively. The patients in the involvement group had a higher probability of impaired attention, visuospatial cognition, emotion recognition, and visual field than did those in the non-involvement group. In addition, tumor in the WM-TPJ were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival (p = 0.039 and 0.023, respectively). Conclusions: GBMs involving the right WM-TPJ are more likely to result in poor postoperative KPS scores and prognoses. Impairments of several kinds of brain functions caused by tumor invasion to the WM-TPJ may be associated with lower KPS scores.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37847481
"""The autophagy-associated factors DRAM1 and p62 regulate cell migration and invasion in glioblastoma stem cells.""","""The aggressiveness of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is defined by local invasion and resistance to therapy. Within established GBM, a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells with stem-like properties (GBM stem cells, GSCs) is believed to underlie resistance to therapy. The metabolic pathway autophagy has been implicated in the regulation of survival in GBM. However, the status of autophagy in GBM and its role in the cancer stem cell fraction is currently unclear. We found that a number of autophagy regulators are highly expressed in GBM tumors carrying a mesenchymal signature, which defines aggressiveness and invasion, and are associated with components of the MAPK pathway. This autophagy signature included the autophagy-associated genes DRAM1 and SQSTM1, which encode a key regulator of selective autophagy, p62. High levels of DRAM1 were associated with shorter overall survival in GBM patients. In GSCs, DRAM1 and SQSTM1 expression correlated with activation of MAPK and expression of the mesenchymal marker c-MET. DRAM1 knockdown decreased p62 localization to autophagosomes and its autophagy-mediated degradation, thus suggesting a role for DRAM1 in p62-mediated autophagy. In contrast, autophagy induced by starvation or inhibition of mTOR/PI-3K was not affected by either DRAM1 or p62 downregulation. Functionally, DRAM1 and p62 regulate cell motility and invasion in GSCs. This was associated with alterations of energy metabolism, in particular reduced ATP and lactate levels. Taken together, these findings shed new light on the role of autophagy in GBM and reveal a novel function of the autophagy regulators DRAM1 and p62 in control of migration/invasion in cancer stem cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22525272

Î±-thujone is the main component of Thuja occidentalis essential oil, which has been suggested to possess anti-tumor activities. This monoterpene easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, we examined its effects on the malignancy of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, with the special emphasis on the mechanisms of its effect on cell viability and invasiveness. Î±-thujone exerted the attenuating effect on the viability and proliferation of GBM cells when administered at the concentrations between 100 and 500 Î¼g/ml (660 Î¼M - 3.2 mM). This effect was correlated with the induction of apoptosis in GBM cell populations and with considerable inhibition of GBM cells motility. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated the induction of oxidative stress and autophagy in Î±-thujone-treated tumor cells, whereas normal astrocytes displayed considerably lower sensitivity to Î±-thujone. Our observations demonstrate that Î±-thujone exerts pro-apoptotic and anti-invasive effects on GBM cells.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the expression of miR-203 in high WHO grade glioma tissues was significantly decreased compared with low WHO grade glioma tissues and normal brain tissues, and its expression demonstrated a decreasing tendency with ascending WHO grades. The transfection of the miR-203 mimic into U251 cells markedly downregulated the expression of phospholipase D2 (PLD2), which was identified as a direct target of miR-203. Furthermore, miR-203 overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of U251 cells, while the overexpression of PLD2 abrogated these effects induced by the miR-203 mimic. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the clinical significance of miR-203 in gliomas and suggested that miR-203 was able to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, partially at least via suppressing the protein expression of PLD2.

Results: Our results showed that tricetin inhibited the migration/invasion of two GBM cell lines. We found that tricetin inhibited MMP-2 expression in the GBM cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and promoter activity assays indicated that tricetin inhibited MMP-2 expression at the transcriptional level. Such inhibitory effects were associated with the suppression of specificity protein-1 (SP-1) DNA-binding activity. An examination of clinical samples revealed a positive correlation between SP-1 and MMP-2 in glioma specimens, and higher expression levels were correlated with a worse probability of survival. Moreover, blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway also inhibited MMP-2-mediated cell motility, and further enhanced the anti-invasive ability of tricetin in GBM cells.

At present, however, it is clear that tumor cell invasion can occur without angiogenesis, a phenomenon that is particularly evident by the infiltrative growth of malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastomas (GBMs). In these tumors, amplification or overexpression of wild-type (wt) or truncated and constitutively activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are regarded as important events in GBM development, where the complex downstream signaling events have been implicated in tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and proliferation. Here, we show that amplification and in particular activation of wild-type EGFR represents an underlying mechanism for non-angiogenic, invasive tumor growth. Using a clinically relevant human GBM xenograft model, we show that tumor cells with EGFR gene amplification and activation diffusely infiltrate normal brain tissue independent of angiogenesis and that transient inhibition of EGFR activity by cetuximab inhibits the invasive tumor growth. Moreover, stable, long-term expression of a dominant-negative EGFR leads to a mesenchymal to epithelial-like transition and induction of angiogenic tumor growth. Analysis of human GBM biopsies confirmed that EGFR activation correlated with invasive/non-angiogenic tumor growth.

Mn-treatment of U87 cells induced a down-regulation of MAPK pathway but the AKT pathway was not markedly affected. Mn-treatment of these cells induced decreases in their levels of c-Jun and c-Fos transcription factors and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes like MMP-2, which are associated with glioblastoma invasiveness. Mn-treatment also induced apoptosis in U87 cells. Thus, our results indicate that other than inducing apoptosis in U87 cells, Mn exerts differential effects on several signaling pathways promoting glioblastoma proliferation and invasion.

Our live-cell imaging microdevice is comprised of polyacrylamide microchannels that exhibit tissue-like stiffness and present chemokine gradients along each channel. Due to intrinsic differences in motility, cell subpopulations separate along the channel axis. The separated cells are then lysed in situ and each single-cell lysate is subjected to western blotting in the surrounding polyacrylamide matrix. We observe correlations between motility and Nestin and EphA2 expression. We identify protein-protein correlations within single TICs, which would be obscured with population-based assays.

Immunohistochemical analysis of CatS expression was performed on 126 paraffin-embedded tumour samples. Fifty-one astrocytoma cases were suitable for both frozen tissue and paraffin tissue analysis. ELISA revealed minimal expression of CatS in normal brain homogenates. CatS expression was increased in grade IV tumours whereas astrocytoma grades I-III exhibited lower values. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a similar pattern of expression. Moreover, high-CatS immunohistochemical scores in glioblastomas were associated with significantly shorter survival (10 vs. 5 months, p = 0.014). With forced inclusion of patient age, radiation dose and Karnofsky score in the Cox multivariate model, CatS score was found to be an independent predictor of survival. CatS expression in astrocytomas is associated with tumour progression and poor outcome in glioblastomas. CatS may serve as a useful prognostic indicator and potential target for anti-invasive therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16550604
"""Cisplatin but not BCNU inhibits urokinase-type plasminogen activator levels in human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro.""","""Glioblastomas extensively invade the surrounding normal brain tissue, with a concomitant expression of various proteolytic enzymes, in particular urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). In this study we used cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin) and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), commonly used anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of glioblastomas, to study the expression of uPA in three human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. Cells were treated with 25 microM cisplatin and 50 microM BCNU, and uPA levels were estimated by fibrin zymography during a 72-h time course. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with cisplatin resulted in significantly decreased levels of uPA in serum-free conditioned medium and cell extracts, compared to BCNU-treated and untreated cell lines. Quantitative levels of uPA enzyme activity assessed by scanning laser densitometry and uPA protein by ELISA using antibody against uPA showed decreased levels of uPA in cisplatin-treated glioma cell lines relative to BCNU and untreated cell lines. Our results suggest that anti-tumor compound, cisplatin, may exert its anti-neoplastic effects by inhibiting uPA in malignant glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9219734
"""Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 enhances glioblastoma invasion by activating invasion-enhancing genes.""","""Comparison of gene expressing profiles between gliomas with different grades revealed frequent overexpression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) in glioblastoma (GBM), the most advanced stage of glioma. To determine whether IGFBP2 is involved in the proliferative and invasive nature of GBM, we established stable SNB19 GBM cell lines that overexpress IGFBP2. Although there was no marked difference in the cell growth between IGFBP2 overexpressing SNB19(BP2) lines when compared with the control cells, these clones showed significantly increased invasive rates when compared with the parental or vector transfected SNB19 cells. Total RNAs from controls and SNB19(BP2) clones were used for microarray analysis to detect IGFBP2-mediated alterations in gene expression. When compared with parental or vector-transfected control cells, SNB19(BP2) cells consistently showed 3-5-fold increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) as well as other invasion related genes. Increased MMP-2 expression in SNB19(BP2) cells was subsequently confirmed by real time reverse-transcription PCR, Western blotting, and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, consistent with increased MMP-2 expression in SNB19(BP2) cells, transient transfection of a MMP-2 promoter/luciferase reporter also resulted in 3-6-fold higher luciferase activity in SNB19(BP2) cells than in parental or vector-transfected control cells. Finally, tissue microarray analysis of 68 GBM tissue specimens showed a significant correlation between the overexpression of IGFBP2 and elevated MMP-2 expression. Taken together, our data provide evidence that IGFBP2 contributes to glioma progression in part by enhancing MMP-2 gene transcription and in turn tumor cell invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12907597
"""Fibroblast growth factor 13 regulates glioma cell invasion and is important for bevacizumab-induced glioma invasion.""","""Glioblastoma has the poorest prognosis, and is characterized by excessive invasion and angiogenesis. To determine the invasive mechanisms, we previously used two glioma cell lines (J3T-1 and J3T-2) with different invasive phenotypes. The J3T-1 showed abundant angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion around neovasculature, while J3T-2 showed diffuse cell infiltration into surrounding healthy parenchyma. Microarray analyses were used to identify invasion-related genes in J3T-2 cells, and the expressed genes and their intracellular and intratumoral distribution patterns were evaluated in J3T-2 cell lines, human glioma cell lines, human glioblastoma stem cells and human glioblastoma specimens. To determine the role of the invasion-related genes, invasive activities were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) was overexpressed in J3T-2 cells compared to J3T-1 cells, and in human glioma cell lines, human glioblastoma stem cells and human glioblastoma specimens, when compared to that of normal human astrocytes. Immunohistochemical staining and the RNA-seq (sequencing) data from the IVY Glioblastoma Atlas Project showed FGF13 expression in glioma cells in the invasive edges of tumor specimens. Also, the intracellular distribution was mainly in the cytoplasm of tumor cells and colocalized with tubulin. Overexpression of FGF13 stabilized tubulin dynamics in vitro and knockdown of FGF13 decreased glioma invasion both in vitro and in vivo and prolonged overall survival of several xenograft models. FGF13 was negatively regulated by hypoxic condition. Silencing of FGF13 also decreased in vivo bevacizumab-induced glioma invasion. In conclusion, FGF13 regulated glioma cell invasion and bevacizumab-induced glioma invasion, and could be a novel target for glioma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29059154
"""Quantifying Uncertainty and Robustness in a Biomathematical Model-Based Patient-Specific Response Metric for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness. A growing body of literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the proliferation-invasion model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, days gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Furthermore, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. Although promising, the original article did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric, leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. Methods: We harnessed the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: (1) image acquisition and (2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first used synthetic data to characterize what nonerror variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then considered the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Results: Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pretreatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort, there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression was over 80% reliable. Conclusion: Although additional validation must be performed, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758984
"""Immune microenvironment of experimental rat C6 gliomas resembles human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor, with ineffective anti-tumor responses and a poor prognosis despite aggressive treatments. GBM immune microenvironment is heterogenous and activation of specific immune populations in GBM is not fully characterized. Reliable animal models are critical for defining mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. First we analyzed the immune subpopulations present in rat C6 gliomas. Using flow cytometry we determined kinetics of infiltration of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes into glioma-bearing brains. We found significant increases of the amoeboid, pro-tumorigenic microglia/macrophages, T helper (Th) and T regulatory (Treg) cells in tumor-bearing brains, and rare infiltrating T cytotoxic (Tc) cells. Transcriptomic analyses of glioma-bearing hemispheres revealed overexpression of invasion and immunosuppression-related genes, reflecting the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Microglia, sorted as CD11b+CD45low cells from gliomas, displayed the pro-invasive and immunosuppressive type of activation. Accumulation of Th and Treg cells combined with the reduced presence of Tc lymphocytes in rat gliomas may result in the lack of effective anti-tumor responses. Transcriptional profiles of CD11b+ cells and composition of immune infiltrates in C6 gliomas indicate that rat C6 gliomas employ similar immune system evasion strategies as human GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29242629
"""A comparative study of primary and recurrent human glioblastoma multiforme using the small animal imaging and molecular expressive profiles.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor with the characteristics of highly infiltrative growth and recurrent rate. In this study, we used animal imaging and molecular expressive profiles to investigate the characteristics of the primary tumor (GBM-3) cells and recurrent tumor (S1R1) cells from different GBM patients. Procedures: Bioluminescent imaging and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for assessing the orthotopical tumor development of GBM cells harboring a polycistronic reporter gene system. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to compare the molecular expressive profiles of two types of GBM cells. Results: S1R1 cells exhibited apparent invasive ability compared to GBM-3 cells using in vitro invasion assay. In vivo bioluminescent imaging showed that intracranial tumors are formed by both types of GBM cells, but the bioluminescent signal was also detected in the lumbar region at late-stage tumor formed by S1R1 cells. The MRI showed that intracranial tumors formed by S1R1 cells were highly infiltrative compared to that formed by GBM-3 cells. Additionally, these two GBM types expressed different patterns of molecules associated with tumor development. Moreover, the suppressive effects of interleukine-23 (IL-23) on xenograft tumors formed by both GBM types were detected using bioluminescent imaging. Conclusion: The current data suggest that the in vivo growth behaviors and therapeutic responses of the primary and recurrent human GBMs were comparable using the reporter gene imaging, and different molecular expressive profiles exist between these two GBM types.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22948536
"""Subependymal spread of recurrent glioblastoma detected with the intraoperative use of 5-aminolevulinic acid: case report.""","""Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) can occur locally or at distant sites within the brain. Though MRI is the standard imaging modality for primary and recurrent GBM, the full extent of diffuse lesions may not be appreciated on MRI alone. Glioblastomas with ependymal and/or subependymal spread are examples of diffuse infiltrative tumors that are incompletely seen on MRI. Some other adjuvant visualization technique such as intraoperative fluorescence-assisted 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) could be used to assist the surgeon in localizing the infiltrating tumor. The authors report on a 56-year-old man who presented 7 years after initial resection of an occipital lobe GBM with imaging consistent with distant discrete foci of tumor recurrence. Because these foci were distant from the original resection cavity, there was concern for diffuse, infiltrative tumor elsewhere throughout the brain versus a distant multicentric recurrence. Therefore, the patient was given 5-ALA prior to surgery to aid in tumor detection intraoperatively. Using fluorescent visualization of the resection cavity, it was confirmed that there was subependymal and ependymal spread of the recurrent tumor along the lateral ventricle connecting the recurrence to the previous tumor site. Magnetic resonance imaging may not completely detect the presence of diffuse tumor infiltrating the ependymal or subependymal spaces. Therefore, adjunct intraoperative use of fluorescence-assisted visualization with 5-ALA may be helpful in highlighting and detecting infiltrative tumor to accurately detect tumor burden and distinguish it from a separate multicentric recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23421452
"""Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on invasion-promoting proteins secreted by glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly invasive and aggressive brain tumor with an invariably poor prognosis. The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a primary influencer of invasion and proliferation in tumor cells and the constitutively active EGFRvIII mutant, found in 30-65% of Glioblastoma multiforme, confers more aggressive invasion. To better understand how EGFR contributes to tumor aggressiveness, we investigated the effect of EGFR on the secreted levels of 65 rationally selected proteins involved in invasion. We employed selected reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry using stable isotope labeled internal peptide standards to quantity proteins in the secretome from five GBM (U87) isogenic cell lines in which EGFR, EGFRvIII, and/or PTEN were expressed. Our results show that cell lines with EGFR overexpression and constitutive EGFRvIII expression differ remarkably in the expression profiles for both secreted and intracellular signaling proteins, and alterations in EGFR signaling result in reproducible changes in concentrations of secreted proteins. Furthermore, the EGFRvIII-expressing mutant cell line secretes the majority of the selected invasion-promoting proteins at higher levels than other cell lines tested. Additionally, the intracellular and extracellular protein measurements indicate elevated oxidative stress in the EGFRvIII-expressing cell line. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that EGFR signaling has a significant effect on the levels of secreted invasion-promoting proteins, likely contributing to the aggressiveness of Glioblastoma multiforme. Further characterization of these proteins may provide candidates for new therapeutic strategies and targets as well as biomarkers for this aggressive disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997998
"""Cancer Cell-Sticky Hydrogels to Target the Cell Membrane of Invading Glioblastomas.""","""Owing to their remarkable infiltrative traits, glioblastomas develop unclear tumor margins toward the brain, hampering the complete resection. Since the remaining invasive cells tend to have resistance to therapeutics and cause recurrence around the surgical voids, this has been a major challenge for glioblastoma treatment. Thus, we design a cancer cell-sticky hydrogel (CSH) that interacts with the glioblastoma cells to impede their invasive motility by modifying the cell membrane with active thiol-enriched interfaces. Highly reactive thiols at the cell surface can make the infiltrated cancer cells adhere to the hydrogel, resulting in increased cell adhesion and decreased motility. Cotreatment with the CSH and chemical inhibitors of the major proinvasive molecules, focal adhesion kinase and hyaluronic acid synthase, maximized the invasion-inhibitory effect. In addition, a significant decrease in tumor mass was achieved via CSH implantation in mouse models. Overall, our results highlight the use of the CSH to inhibit the aggressive invasion as a novel therapeutic strategy against glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34196172
"""Wild type p53-dependent transcriptional upregulation of cathepsin L expression is mediated by C/EBPÎ± in human glioblastoma cells.""","""Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 are frequent in human glioblastomas. Similarly cathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is overexpressed and secreted by most human tumors including glioblastomas. However, hitherto there is no information on whether or not the mutation(s) in the p53 gene affect(s) expression of this protease. Using human glioblastoma cell lines harboring wild type and mutant p53, we demonstrate here for the first time that only the wild type but not the mutant p53 upregulates cathepsin L expression. By transfection of promoter reporter constructs, site-directed mutagenesis and chip assays we have established that wild type p53 elevates the levels of cathepsin L in these cells. It does so directly by binding to the cathepsin L promoter and also indirectly by inducing the expression of C/EBPÎ±, which is crucial for the transcription of this protease. In view of its role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion, increased expression of cathepsin L in glioblastoma cells harboring wild type p53 might confer invasive ability and growth advantage to these cells. Therefore, use of cathepsin L inhibitors could prove useful in the management of these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20536385
"""Enhancement of invadopodia activity in glioma cells by sublethal doses of irradiation and temozolomide.""","""OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system tumor in adults. These tumors are highly invasive and infiltrative and result in tumor recurrence as well as an extremely poor patient prognosis. The current standard of care involves surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, previous studies have suggested that glioblastoma cells that survive treatment are potentially more invasive. The goal of this study was to investigate whether this increased phenotype in surviving cells is facilitated by actin-rich, membrane-based structures known as invadopodia. METHODS A number of commercially available cell lines and glioblastoma cell lines obtained from patients were initially screened for the protein expression levels of invadopodia regulators. Gelatin-based zymography was also used to establish their secretory protease profile. The effects of radiation and temozolomide treatment on the glioblastoma cells were then investigated with cell viability, Western blotting, gelatin-based zymography, and invadopodia matrix degradation assays. RESULTS The authors' results show that the glioma cells used in this study express a number of invadopodia regulators, secrete MMP-2, and form functional matrix-degrading invadopodia. Cells that were treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide were observed to show an increase primarily in the activation of MMP-2. Importantly, this also resulted in a significant enhancement in the invadopodia-facilitated matrix-degrading ability of the cells, along with an increase in the percentage of cells with invadopodia after radiation and temozolomide treatment. CONCLUSIONS The data from this study suggest that the increased invasive phenotype that has been previously observed in glioma cells posttreatment is mediated by invadopodia. The authors propose that if the formation or activity of these structures can be disrupted, they could potentially serve as a viable target for developing novel adjuvant therapeutic strategies that can be used in conjunction with the current treatment protocols in combatting the invasive phenotype of this deadly disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29148898

"""Overexpression of CD97 confers an invasive phenotype in glioblastoma cells and is associated with decreased survival of glioblastoma patients.""","""Mechanisms of invasion in glioblastoma (GBM) relate to differential expression of proteins conferring increased motility and penetration of the extracellular matrix. CD97 is a member of the epidermal growth factor seven-span transmembrane family of adhesion G-protein coupled receptors. These proteins facilitate mobility of leukocytes into tissue. In this study we show that CD97 is expressed in glioma, has functional effects on invasion, and is associated with poor overall survival. Glioma cell lines and low passage primary cultures were analyzed. Functional significance was assessed by transient knockdown using siRNA targeting CD97 or a non-target control sequence. Invasion was assessed 48 hours after siRNA-mediated knockdown using a Matrigel-coated invasion chamber. Migration was quantified using a scratch assay over 12 hours. Proliferation was measured 24 and 48 hours after confirmed protein knockdown. GBM cell lines and primary cultures were found to express CD97. Knockdown of CD97 decreased invasion and migration in GBM cell lines, with no difference in proliferation. Gene-expression based Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas, demonstrating an inverse relationship between CD97 expression and survival. GBMs expressing high levels of CD97 were associated with decreased survival compared to those with low CD97 (p = 0.007). CD97 promotes invasion and migration in GBM, but has no effect on tumor proliferation. This phenotype may explain the discrepancy in survival between high and low CD97-expressing tumors.

"""Down-regulation of Connexin43 expression reveals the involvement of caveolin-1 containing lipid rafts in human U251 glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Glioblastoma cells are characterized by high proliferation and invasive capacities. Tumor development has been associated with a decrease of gap-junctional intercellular communication, but the concrete involvement of gap junction proteins, connexins, remains elusive since they are also suspected to promote cell invasion. In order to better understand how connexins control the glioma cell phenotype, we studied the consequences of inhibiting the intrinsic expression of the major astrocytic connexin, Connexin43, in human U251 glioblastoma cells by the shRNA strategy. The induced down-regulation of Cx43 expression has various effects on the U251 cells such as increased clonogenicity, angiogenesis and decreased adhesion on specific extracellular matrix proteins. We demonstrate that the invasion capacity measured in vitro and ex vivo correlates with Cx43 expression level. For the first time in a cancer cell context, our work demonstrates that Cx43 cofractionates, colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with a lipid raft marker, caveolin-1 and that this interaction is inversely correlated to the level of Cx43. This localization of Cx43 in these lipid raft microdomains regulates both homo- and heterocellular gap junctional communications (respectively between U251 cells, or between U251 cells and astrocytes). Moreover, the adhesive and invasive capacities are not dependent, in our model, on Cav-1 expression level. Our results tend to show that heterocellular gap junctional communication between cancer and stroma cells may affect the behavior of the tumor cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate that Cx43 controls the tumor phenotype of glioblastoma U251 cells and in particular, invasion capacity, through its localization in lipid rafts containing Cav-1.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21882259
"""The Combined Influence of Hydrogel Stiffness and Matrix-Bound Hyaluronic Acid Content on Glioblastoma Invasion.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. Its high mortality is associated with its aggressive invasion throughout the brain. The heterogeneity of stiffness and hyaluronic acid (HA) content within the brain makes it difficult to study invasion in vivo.

Using a library of stiffness-matched hydrogels with variable levels of matrix-bound HA, it is reported that U251 GBM invasion is enhanced in softer hydrogels but reduced in the presence of matrix-bound HA. Inhibiting HA-CD44 interactions reduces invasion, even in hydrogels lacking matrix-bound HA. Analysis of HA biosynthesis suggests that GBM cells compensate for a lack of matrix-bound HA by producing soluble HA to stimulate invasion. Together, a robust method is showed to quantify GBM invasion over long culture times to reveal the coordinated effect of matrix stiffness, immobilized HA, and compensatory HA production on GBM invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28379642

A slightly higher invasiveness and shorter survival was seen in tumors with EGF receptor overexpression, and the opposite pattern was found for tumors with a TP53 mutation. The degree of invasiveness in vitro was far higher than would be expected from the dynamics of clinically observed tumor spread.

We investigated the expression of BK channels in GBM stem-like cells using electrophysiological and immunochemical techniques, and assessed their involvement in the migratory process of this important cell subpopulation. In U87-MG cells, BK channel expression and function were markedly upregulated by growth conditions that enriched the culture in GBM stem-like cells (U87-NS). Cytofluorimetric analysis further confirmed the appearance of a cell subpopulation that co-expressed high levels of BK channels and CD133, as well as other stem cell markers. A similar association was also found in cells derived from freshly resected GBM biopsies. Finally, transwell migration tests showed that U87-NS cells migration was much more sensitive to BK channel block than U87-MG cells.

Results: We totally found 211 survival-related genes and developed a signature with 17 survival-related genes for prognosis of glioblastoma. Based on this signature, the low-risk group had longer survival time while the high-risk group had shorter survival time. Additionally, the expression profiles between the high-risk and low-risk glioblastoma were different.

Analyzing glioma cell migration in vitro, we have demonstrated the spontaneous shedding of anucleate cell fragments that separate from glioma cell bodies and maintain viability from hours to days. Unlike previously described cell fragments that are released from cells as diffusible vectors, glioma cell fragments are independently motile. We used computerized time-lapse microscopy to characterize the formation of these independent motile microplasts (IMMPs) in human cell cultures derived from the most highly invasive glial tumor, glioblastoma. IMMPs were larger than previously described cell fragments, ranging in size from approximately 2% to nearly half of the area of their parent cells. Complex cell-like behaviors-including establishment of polarity, extension of lamellipodia and filopodia, and change in direction of movement-remained intact in IMMPs. The average direction and velocity of the IMMPs were indistinguishable from those of their parent cells. IMMPs formed at a significantly higher rate in glioma cell lines rendered more invasive by overexpression of invasion-related genes than in vector-transfected controls.

Following incubation, colonies were counted to determine percent survival. All six cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to Taxol (LD50 1 nM to > 250 nM). However, even at concentrations exceeding those achievable clinically, all cell lines had surviving cells, indicating a saturation threshold for Taxol cytotoxicity. Cell locomotion was evaluated using the radial dish assay to determine the rate of egress of cells from a region of high cell density to the periphery. Increasing Taxol concentration caused increased locomotion in all six cell lines (p < 0.0001). Although Taxol has significant cytocidal impact, it increases in vitro locomotion of glioblastoma cells.

To examine these effects in more depth, four human glioblastoma cell lines (A-172, U-138, LN-229 and LN-18) were irradiated on fibronectin (FN), Matrigel, BSA or polystyrene. Major findings of this study include a significantly increased survival of irradiated A-172 but not of irradiated U-138, LN-229, and LN-18 cells on FN or Matrigel compared to cells irradiated on polystyrene or BSA. Irradiation induced a dose-dependent increase in functional beta 1- and beta 3-integrins in all four glioma cell lines. This integrin induction caused improved cell adhesion to FN or Matrigel. In contrast to U-138, LN-229 and LN-18 cells, irradiation strongly impaired A-172 cell invasion. Invasion of all cell lines was inhibited by anti-integrin antibodies, the disintegrin echistatin and the MMP-2/-9 inhibitor III. Additionally, beta 1- and beta 3-integrins modulated basal and radiation-altered gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2. Tested glioblastoma cell lines showed a differential cellular susceptibility to FN or Matrigel which affected the cellular radiosensitivity. Three out of four glioma cell lines demonstrated a combination of a substratum-independent survival after irradiation and an invasive potential which was not affected by irradiation. beta 1- and beta 3-integrins were identified to play a substantial, regulatory role in survival, adhesion, invasion and MMP-2 activity.

"""Hypermethylation of the proapoptotic gene TMS1/ASC: prognostic importance in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The identification of clinical subsets of glioblastomas (GBM) associated with different molecular genetic profiles had opened the possibility to design tailored therapies to individual patients. One of the most intrigued subtypes is the long-term survival (LTS) GBM, which responds better to current therapies. The present investigation on GBM from 50 consecutive GBM displaying classic survival and seven LTS GBM is based on molecular epigenetic, clinical and histopathological analyses. Our aim was to recognize biomarkers useful to distinguish LTS from classic GBM. We analyzed the promoter methylation status of key regulator genes implicated in tumor invasion (TIMP2, TIMP3), apoptosis and inflammation (TMS1/ASC, DAPK) as well as overall survival, therapy status and tumor pathological features. For the first purpose a methylation-specific PCR approach was performed to analyze the CpG island promoter methylation status of each gene. The overall TMS1/ASC methylation rate in the 57 analyzed tumors was 21.05%. Hypermethylation of TMS1/ASC was significantly more frequent in LTS GBM (57.1% vs. 16%, P=0.029, Fisher's exact test). DAPK promoter hypermethylation was only observed in the LTS subset (14.3%) whereas TIMP2 and TIMP3 were unmethylated in both GBM collectives. Our results strongly suggest that, compared to classic GBM, LTS GBM display distinct epigenetic characteristics which might provide additional prognostic biomarkers for the assessment of this malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17048097
"""Silencing of Eps8 blocks migration and invasion in human glioblastoma cell lines.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant human primary brain tumor, and its infiltrative nature represents the leading cause for the failure of therapies and tumor recurrences. It is therefore crucial the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM invasion to identify novel therapeutic targets to limit motility. In this study, we evaluated the role of Epidermal growth factor receptor Pathway Substrate 8 (Eps8), a crucial regulator of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics accompanying cell motility and invasion, in GBM migration and invasiveness. We found that silencing of the protein by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) abrogated the migratory and invasive capacity of three different human GBM cell lines both in 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-dimensional (3-D) in vitro assays. The inhibitory effect on invasion was maintained independently by the migration mode utilized by the cells in our 3-D model, and was accompanied by an impaired formation of actin-based cytoskeletal protrusive structures. Our data propose Eps8 as a key molecule involved in the control of the intrinsic invasive behavior of GBM cells, and suggest that this protein might represent a useful target for the design of new drugs for the treatment of these tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22683923
"""Differential expression of microRNAs as predictors of glioblastoma phenotypes.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary central nervous tumor and carries a very poor prognosis. Invasion precludes effective treatment and virtually assures tumor recurrence. In the current study, we applied analytical and bioinformatics approaches to identify a set of microRNAs (miRs) from several different human glioblastoma cell lines that exhibit significant differential expression between migratory (edge) and migration-restricted (core) cell populations. The hypothesis of the study is that differential expression of miRs provides an epigenetic mechanism to drive cell migration and invasion. Results: Our research data comprise gene expression values for a set of 805 human miRs collected from matched pairs of migratory and migration-restricted cell populations from seven different glioblastoma cell lines. We identified 62 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated miRs that exhibit significant differential expression in the migratory (edge) cell population compared to matched migration-restricted (core) cells. We then conducted target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis with these miRs to investigate potential associated gene and pathway targets. Several miRs in the list appear to directly target apoptosis related genes. The analysis identifies a set of genes that are predicted by 3 different algorithms, further emphasizing the potential validity of these miRs to promote glioblastoma. Conclusions: The results of this study identify a set of miRs with potential for decreased expression in invasive glioblastoma cells. The verification of these miRs and their associated targeted proteins provides new insights for further investigation into therapeutic interventions. The methodological approaches employed here could be applied to the study of other diseases to provide biomedical researchers and clinicians with increased opportunities for therapeutic interventions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24438171
"""The role of IDH1 mutated tumour cells in secondary glioblastomas: an evolutionary game theoretical view.""","""Recent advances in clinical medicine have elucidated two significantly different subtypes of glioblastoma which carry very different prognoses, both defined by mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1). The mechanistic consequences of this mutation have not yet been fully clarified, with conflicting opinions existing in the literature; however, IDH-1 mutation may be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish between primary and secondary glioblastoma multiforme (sGBM) from malignant progression of a lower grade glioma. We develop a mathematical model of IDH-1 mutated secondary glioblastoma using evolutionary game theory to investigate the interactions between four different phenotypic populations within the tumor: autonomous growth, invasive, glycolytic, and the hybrid invasive/glycolytic cells.

Despite of very aggressive treatment options based on surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of affected patients has remained poor and showed only slight improvements during the last 30 years. Research on glioblastoma border zone was hindered by the tumor's intense invasion into the brain parenchyma and the lack of suitable tumor cell markers. Nevertheless, the compact tumor mass and tumor invasion zone are composed of distinct cell types that need to be distinguished from each other to be addressed selectively. As the isoform 140 of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-140) was recently demonstrated to be lost in human gliomas with rising WHO grade, human multiform glioblastomas were characterized as a NCAM-140 negative entity displaying three main distinct invasion patterns. Evaluation of putative therapy targets within the tumor tissue and tumor invasion zone has been made possible through NCAM-140 negativity. In the present study, brain tissue controls and human glioblastoma samples with compact tumor mass and invasion areas were analyzed for their vascularization at the tumor border and the expression of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR-1) within tumor tissue and vascular vessel walls. Use of NCAM-140 enabled the identification of the tumor invasion zone and its experimental investigation. Tissue vascularization was found to be significantly increased in the compact tumor mass of glioblastomas compared to their invasion zone and tumor-free controls with a significantly high and specific overexpression of PAR-1 within tumor cells and within tumor blood vessels depending upon the tumor area. This suggests thereby a functional role of the thrombin receptor PAR-1 in glioma cell malignancy and glioblastoma neoangiogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24620969

TIMP-1 is known to be expressed in gliomas but whether TIMP-1 is a prognostic marker in gliomas has not previously been investigated. In the present study, the TIMP-1 expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 112 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded astrocytomas and related to tumour grade and overall patient survival by scoring the TIMP-1 immunoreactivity of both tumour cells and blood vessels. Moreover, TIMP-1 in situ hybridisation was performed on ten of the glioblastomas. In the vast majority of the tumours TIMP-1 protein was expressed in both tumour cells and blood vessels. In situ hybridisation for TIMP-1 mRNA on glioblastomas confirmed the immunohistochemical expression of TIMP-1. The percentage of TIMP-1 positive tumour cells and blood vessels as well as the staining intensity varied between tumours of the same grade, but the total staining score increased with tumour grade. The multivariate Cox regression test showed that glioblastoma patients with the lowest TIMP-1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (HR (95% CI) = 3.2 (1.5-6.7), P = 0.004) when compared to the patients with higher TIMP-1 protein expression. In conclusion, this study showed that low TIMP-1 immunohistochemical expression predicts longer overall survival in glioblastoma patients, suggesting a role for TIMP-1 as a biomarker in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19430729

Ascochlorin (ASC) has anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic, and synergistic effect in various types of cancer cells.

In this study, we found that ASC indeed inhibits cell migration and invasion in U373MG and A172. ASC significantly suppresses the MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity and expression in U373MG and A172. To determine the molecular mechanism by which ASC suppressed cell migration and invasion, we investigated whether ASC could modulate metastasis via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, a potential drug target. ASC strongly inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK, and treatment with a FAK inhibitor significantly suppresses cancer cell migration in the presence of ASC. In addition, ASC significantly decreased phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3, cancer cell migration and nuclear translocation of STAT3. Taken together, these results suggest that ASC inhibits cell migration and invasion by blocking FAK and JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in reduced MMP-2 activity. J. Cell. Biochem. 119: 300-313, 2018.

"""A screening platform for glioma growth and invasion using bioluminescence imaging. Laboratory investigation.""","""Object: The study of tumor cell growth and invasion in cancer biology is often limited by the inability to visualize tumor cell behavior in real time in animal models. The authors provide evidence that glioma cells are heterogeneous,with a subset responsible for increased invasiveness. The use of bioluminescence (BL) imaging to investigate dynamic aspects of glioma progression are discussed. Methods: Glioblastoma multiforme-initiating cells were generated under conditions typically used to sustain neural stem cells. The invasiveness potential was determined using a Matrigel chamber. The presence of an 'invasiveness gene signature' that correlated with patient survival outcome was ascertained through microarray gene expression analysis. To measure invasiveness, the authors devised a method focussed on BL imaging and tested it in vitro and in vivo using a zebrafish xenograft model. Bioluminescence imaging signals were verified using known inhibitors of glioma growth: AEE788, N-[(3,5-Difluorophenyl)acetyl]-L-alanyl-2-phenylglycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester, and compound E. Results: The authors' data support the idea that glioblastoma multiforme-initiating cells are heterogeneous and possess an invasive subset; BL imaging was used as a readout method to assess this invasive subset. The in vitro data obtained using a known glioma growth inhibitor, AEE788, showed that BL imaging could detect cellular movement and invasion even before overall cell death was detectable on conventional viability assays. Further work using a zebrafish tumor xenograft model supported the efficacy of BL imaging in monitoring changes in tumor load. Conclusions: The authors used optically transparent zebrafish and high-resolution confocal imaging to track tumor growth in vivo and demonstrate the efficacy of this model for screening antitumor and antiangiogenic compounds.The integration of zebrafish transgenic technology into human cancer biological studies may aid in the development of cancer models targeting specific organs, tissues, or cell types within tumors.

But MVD showed no prognostic impact on multivariate analysis. Neither Cox-2 expression nor vascular pattern showed prognostic value. The difference in Cox-2 expression between the classical and bizarre vascular pattern in glioblastomas was statistically significant (P = 0.047). However, no correlation was found between Cox-2 expression and MVD. These findings suggest that Cox-2 is heterogeneously expressed in glioblastomas without a significant association with MVD.

"""Role of hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGF activator) in invasive growth of human glioblastoma cells in vivo.""","""Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a multifunctional growth factor that is involved in invasive growth of tumor cells via its receptor MET, a protein product of c-met proto-oncogene. HGF activator (HGFA) is a serine proteinase responsible for the activation of proform of HGF/SF (proHGF/SF). In our study, we examined the effects of engineered expression of HGFA on 2 human glioblastoma cell lines (YKG-1 and U251). Both cells expressed MET, while only YKG-1 expressed endogenous proHGF/SF. Enhanced MET phosphorylation and increased migratory activity were induced by the expression of HGFA in YKG-1 cells in vitro in the presence of thrombin, which is a known activator of proHGFA. In contrast, MET phosphorylation was consistently observed in U251 that lacked endogenous HGF/SF, suggesting ligand-independent activation of MET in this cell line. Consequently, the expression of HGFA in U251 did not enhance the MET phosphorylation and following cellular response even with the thrombin treatment. However, addition of exogenous proHGF/SF resulted in enhanced migratory activity of HGFA-expressing U251 cells in the presence of thrombin in vitro. The engineered HGFA expression resulted in significantly enhanced tumor growth with increased vascular density in vivo when YKG-1 cells were implanted in nude mouse brain. This effect was not observed in U251 lacking endogenous proHGF/SF. These results indicate the possible existence of multiple mechanisms of MET activation in glioblastomas and that the activation system of proHGF/SF is important in progression of glioblastomas that express endogenous proHGF/SF and require ligand-dependent MET activation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16106403

In tumors, the presence of LOXL3 has been associated with genomic stability, cell proliferation, and metastasis. In silico analysis has shown that glioblastoma was among tumors with the highest LOXL3 expression levels. LOXL3 silencing of U87MG cells by siRNA led to the spreading of the tumor cell surface, and the transcriptome analysis of these cells revealed an upregulation of genes coding for extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton components, convergent to an increase in cell adhesion and a decrease in cell invasion observed in functional assays. Significant correlations of LOXL3 expression with genes coding for tubulins were observed in the mesenchymal subtype in the TCGA RNA-seq dataset of glioblastoma (GBM). Conversely, genes involved in endocytosis and lysosome formation, along with MAPK-binding proteins related to focal adhesion turnover, were downregulated, which may corroborate the observed decrease in cell viability and increase in the rate of cell death.

Here, we describe the expression of a new chondroitin sulphate-modified NRP1 (NRP1-CS) in human tumour cell lines. Expression of a non-modifiable NRP1 mutant (S612A) in U87MG human glioma cells results in enhanced invasion in three dimensions (3D), whereas wild-type NRP1 has no effect. Furthermore, the S612A NRP1 cells show a significant increase in p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation compared with control and wild-type NRP1 cells. Silencing of p130Cas in S612A NRP1 cells resulted in a loss of increased invasive phenotype. Interestingly, p130Cas silencing does not inhibit basal 3D invasion, but leads to a mesenchymal to amoeboid transition. Biopsies from both low- and high-grade human gliomas show strong expression of NRP1, and little expression of NRP1-CS.

This phenomenon is only partially reproduced by rodent models of gliomas that display a very high rate of proliferation and limited cell migration. We have analyzed the development of human glioblastoma cells (GL15) xenografted into the brain of immunosuppressed rats, in order to define the characteristics of tumor cell invasion. As identified by the specific immunolabeling of the tumor cells for the human HLA-ABC antigen, GL15 tumors reproduced the three types of intraparenchymal invasion observed in patients. First, a majority of multipolar tumor cells intermingled rapidly and profusely with host neural cells in the margin of the injection site. This progressively enlarging area was principally responsible for the tumor growth over time. Second, in the gray matter, columns of thin bipolar tumor cells aligned along capillary walls. Third, in the white matter, elongated bipolar isolated tumor cells were observed scattered between axonal fibers. The maximum migration distances along white matter fibers remained significantly higher than the maximum migration distances along blood vessels, up to two months after injection. Development of the tumor was associated with a significant increase of vascularization in the area of tumor spread. Xenografting of human GL15 glioblastoma cells into the immunosuppressed rat brain allowed to differentiate between the three classical types of invasion identified in the clinic, to quantify precisely the distances of migration, and to evaluate cell morphology for each of these routes.

Therefore, the molecular and cellular processes underlying cell migration continue to be a major focus of glioblastoma research. Emerging evidence supports the concept that the tumor microenvironment has a profound influence on the functional properties of tumor cells. Accordingly, substantial effort must be devoted to move from traditional two-dimensional migration assays to three-dimensional systems that more faithfully recapitulate the complex in vivo tumor microenvironment. Methods: In order to mimic the tumor microenvironment of adult gliomas, we used adult organotypic brain slices as an invasion matrix for implanted, fluorescently labeled tumor spheroids. Cell invasion was imaged by confocal or epi-fluorescence microscopy and quantified by determining the average cumulative sprout length per spheroid. The tumor microenvironment was manipulated by treatment of the slice with small molecule inhibitors or using different genetically engineered mouse models as donors. Results: Both epi-fluorescence and confocal microscopy were applied to precisely quantify cell invasion in this ex vivo approach. Usage of a red-emitting membrane dye in addition to tissue clearing drastically improved epi-fluorescence imaging. Preparation of brain slices from of a genetically engineered mouse with a loss of a specific cell surface protein resulted in significantly impaired tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, jasplakinolide treatment of either tumor cells or brain slice significantly reduced tumor cell invasion. Conclusion: We present an optimized invasion assay that closely reflects in vivo invasion by the implantation of glioma cells into organotypic adult brain slice cultures with a preserved cytoarchitecture. The diversity of applications including manipulation of the tumor cells as well as the microenvironment, permits the investigation of rate limiting factors of cell migration in a reliable context.

"""Late Effects of Radiation Prime the Brain Microenvironment for Accelerated Tumor Growth.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable, despite state-of-the-art treatment involving surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation. GBM invariably recurs as a highly invasive and aggressive phenotype, with the majority of recurrences within the radiation therapy treatment field. Although a large body of literature reporting on primary GBM exists, comprehensive studies of how prior irradiation alters recurrent tumor growth are lacking. An animal model that replicates the delayed effects of radiation therapy on the brain microenvironment, and its impact on the development of recurrent GBM, would be a significant advance. Methods and materials: Cohorts of mice received a single fraction of 0, 20, 30, or 40 Gy Gamma Knife irradiation. NaÃ¯ve, nonirradiated mouse GBM tumor cells were implanted into the ipsilateral hemisphere 6 weeks postirradiation. Tumor growth was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and animal survival was assessed by monitoring weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging results were supported by hemotoxylin and eosin histology. Results: Tumorous lesions generated from orthotopic implantation of nonirradiated mouse GBM tumor cells into irradiated mouse brain grew far more aggressively and invasively than implantation of these same cells into nonirradiated brain. Lesions in irradiated brain tissue were significantly larger, more necrotic, and more vascular than those in control animals with increased invasiveness of tumor cells in the periphery, consistent with the histologic features commonly observed in recurrent high-grade tumors in patients. Conclusions: Irradiation of normal brain primes the targeted cellular microenvironment for aggressive tumor growth when naÃ¯ve (not previously irradiated) cancer cells are subsequently introduced. The resultant growth pattern is similar to the highly aggressive pattern of tumor regrowth observed clinically after therapeutic radiation therapy. The mouse model offers an avenue for determining the cellular and molecular basis for the aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30171879
"""'Go or grow': the key to the emergence of invasion in tumour progression?""","""Uncontrolled proliferation and abnormal cell migration are two of the main characteristics of tumour growth. Of ultimate importance is the question what are the mechanisms that trigger the progression from benign neoplasms (uncontrolled/autonomous proliferation) to malignant invasive tumours (high migration). In the following, we challenge the currently prevailing view that the emergence of invasiveness is mainly the consequence of acquired cancer cell mutations. To study this, we mainly focus on the 'glioblastoma multiforme' (GBM) tumour which is a particularly aggressive and invasive tumour. In particular, with the help of a simple growth model, we demonstrate that the short time required for the recurrence of a GBM tumour after a gross total resection cannot be deduced solely from a mutation-based theory. We propose that the transition to invasive tumour phenotypes can be explained on the basis of the microscopic 'Go or Grow' mechanism (migration/proliferation dichotomy) and the oxygen shortage, i.e. hypoxia, in the environment of a growing tumour. We test this hypothesis with the help of a lattice-gas cellular automaton. Finally, we suggest possible therapies that could help prevent the progression towards malignancy and invasiveness of benign tumours.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20610469
"""mir-218-2 promotes glioblastomas growth, invasion and drug resistance by targeting CDC27.""","""Glioma has become a significant global health problem with substantial morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of elucidating its underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have identified mir-218 as an anti-oncogene; however, the specific functions of mir-218-1 and mir-218-2 remain unknown, especially the latter. The objective of this study was to further investigate the role of mir-218-2 in glioma. Our results indicated that mir-218-2 is highly overexpressed in glioma. Furthermore, we showed that mir-218-2 is positively correlated with the growth, invasion, migration, and drug susceptibility (to Î²-lapachone) of glioma cells. In vitro, the overexpression of mir-218-2 promoted glioma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. In addition, the overexpression of mir-218-2 in vivo was found to increase glioma tumor growth. Accordingly, the inhibition of mir-218-2 resulted in the opposite effects. Cell division cycle 27 (CDC27), the downstream target of mir-218-2, is involved in the regulation of glioma cells. Our results indicate that the overexpression of CDC27 counteracted the function of mir-218-2 in glioma cells. These novel findings provide new insight in the application of mir-218-2 as a potential glioma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974673
"""A Monte Carlo based formalism to identify potential locations at high risk of tumor recurrence with a numerical model for glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Purpose: The strategy currently used to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, which mostly relies on population-based failure patterns, does not consider the important variability in such patterns reported in the literature. As part of the multidisciplinary efforts being made to develop personalized therapeutic approaches, numerical models of tumor growth and treatment are increasingly being used by different groups around the world. In this study, a new formalism relying on the proliferation-invasion model is developed to identify potential locations of GBM recurrences. The authors assess the sensitivity of the location of potential tumor recurrences to the input parameter values predicted for a given patient by varying those values using a Monte-Carlo based approach. Our approach is designed to be prospective in the sense that it relies on patient-specific imaging data that can be gathered in one single preradiotherapy imaging session. Methods: The authors modeled the infiltration paths of glial cells using patient-specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Nine GBM patients with preradiotherapy DTI data are considered in this study. The possible locations of tumor recurrences are determined by randomly selecting many ensembles of values for each of the growth and radiobiological parameters in the GBM growth model. A novel concept, the occurrence probability (OP), is introduced to assess the sensitivity of potential tumor recurrence locations to the input parameter values. For a given patient, the OP map is derived from a superposition of all potential tumor recurrence locations obtained with all sets of parameter values. Results: For eight out of nine of patients, the authors have identified a statistically significant region where the OP is above 50%. For two patients, these high risk regions are found to be located at a distance greater than 3.9 cm from the border of the gross tumor volume highlighting the inaccuracy of current margins for some patients. The exact location and size of these volumes with OP > 50 % are, however, sensitive to the number N of ensembles of parameter values for N â² 400. On the other hand, the authors have identified for each patient a threshold OP, the OP(T), which defines a volume that converges more rapidly with increasing N. The OP(T) for each patient varies between 20% and 40%. The volume defined by OP > OP(T) may be an adequate candidate to define a personalized margin for radiotherapy treatment planning of GBM patients. Conclusions: A new Monte-Carlo based formalism was described and used to assess the variability of sites of potential recurrence predicted by the proliferation-invasion model to input parameter values. The authors have shown that high risk areas could be consistently identified with a limited number of sets (N â² 400) of randomly chosen parameter values. A major strength of this formalism is its potential prospective nature. Although a validation of the accuracy of the model-predicted tumor recurrence location still remains to be done, our method is potentially applicable to orient patient-specific definition of margins.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23127062

Observation of palisades is considered as a clinical indicator of the transition from a noninvasive to an invasive tumour.

For this we produced three-dimensional realistic simulations, based on a multiscale hybrid model, coupling the evolution of tumour cells and the oxygen diffusion in tissue, that depict the shape of palisades during its formation. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) the presented simulations can provide clinicians and biologists with a better understanding of three-dimensional structure of palisades as well as of glioblastomas growth dynamics; (2) we show that heterogeneity in cell response to hypoxia is a relevant factor in palisade and pseudopalisade formation; (3) we show how selective processes based on the hypoxia switch influence the tumour proliferation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26235287

The need for the development of new therapeutic agents for GBM is urgent. Here, we aimed to explore the metabolic mechanism of GBM and identified potential novel drugs for GBM by a sub-pathway-based method. By using the GBM microarray data from 'The Cancer Genome Atlas' database, we first identified the 274 differentially expressed genes between GBM and normal samples. Then, we identified 18 significant enriched metabolic sub-pathways that may involve in the development of GBM. Finally, by an integrated analysis of GBM-involved sub-pathways and drug-affected sub-pathways, we identified 66 novel small-molecular drugs capable to target the GBM-involved sub-pathways. Our method could not only identify existing drug (paclitaxel) for GBM, but also predict potentially novel agents (pergolide) that might have therapeutic effects. We also experimentally verified that pergolide could induce GBM cell death.

"""Rac1+ cells distributed in accordance with CD 133+ cells in glioblastomas and the elevated invasiveness of CD 133+ glioma cells with higher Rac1 activity.""","""Background: Recent studies have suggested that cancer stem cells are one of the major causes for tumor recurrence due to their resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although the highly invasive nature of glioblastoma (GBM) cells is also implicated in the failure of current therapies, it is not clear how glioma stem cells (GSCs) are involved in invasiveness. Rac1 activity is necessary for inducing reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and cell movement. In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution characteristics of CD133+ cells and Rac1+ cells in GBM as well as Rac1 activity in CD133+ GBM cells, and analyze the migration and invasion potential of these cells. Methods: A series of 21 patients with GBM were admitted consecutively and received tumor resection in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital during the first half of the year 2011. Tissue specimens were collected both from the peripheral and the central parts for each tumor under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) navigation guidance. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the CD133+ cells and Rac1+ cells distribution in GBM specimens. Double-labeling immunofluorescence was further used to analyze CD133 and Rac1 co-expression and the relationship between CD133+ cells distribution and Rac1 expression. Serum-free medium culture and magnetic sorting were used to isolate CD133+ cells from U87 cell line. Rac1 activation assay was conducted to assess the activation of Rac1 in CD133+ and CD133 - U87 cells. The migration and invasive ability of CD133+ and CD133 - U87 cells were determined by cell migration and invasion assays in vitro. Student's t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test were used to determine statistical significance in this study. Results: In the central parts of GBMs, CD133+ cells were found to cluster around necrosis and occasionally cluster around the vessels under the microscope by immunohistological staining. In the peripheral parts of the tumors, CD133+ cells were lined up along the basement membrane of the vessels and myelinated nerve fibers. Rac1 expression was high and diffused in the central parts of the GBMs, and the Rac1+ cells were distributed basically in accordance with CD133+ cells both in the central and peripheral parts of GBMs. In double-labeling immunofluorescence, Rac1 was expressed in (83.14 Â± 4.23)% of CD133+ cells, and CD133 and Rac1 co-expressed cells were located around the vessels in GBMs. Significantly higher amounts of Rac1-GTP were expressed in the CD133+ cells (0.378 Â± 0.007), compared to CD133- cells (0.195 Â± 0.004) (t = 27.81; P < 0.05). CD133+ cells had stronger ability to migrate (74.34 Â± 2.40 vs. 38.72 Â± 2.60, t = 42.71, P < 0.005) and invade (52.00 Â± 2.28 vs. 31.26 Â± 1.82, t = 30.76, P < 0.005), compared to their counterpart CD133- cells in transwell cell migration/invasion assay. Conclusions: These data suggest that CD133+ GBM cells highly express Rac1 and have greater potential to migrate and invade through activated Rac1-GTP. The accordance of distribution between Rac1+ cells and CD133+ cells in GBMs implies that Rac1 might be an inhibited target to prevent invasion and migration and to avoid malignant glioma recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23253699

The model is able to replicate and justify the clinical observation of rebound growth when AA therapy is discontinued in some patients. The model is interrogated to derive fundamental insights int cancer biology and on the clinical and biological effects of AA drugs.

Methods: An established reaction-diffusion model was employed to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of cancerous regions in T1-MRI images of GBM patients. The effects of the parameters of this model on the simulated tumor borders were quantified and the optimal values were used to estimate the distribution of infiltrative cells (CTVmodel). Radiomics and deep learning models were examined to predict the OS time by analyzing the GTV, clinical CTV, and CTVmodel. Results: The study involves 126 subjects for model development and 62 independent subjects for testing. Evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates comparable predictive power for OS time that is achieved with the clinically defined CTV. Specifically, for the binary survival prediction, short vs. long time, the proposed CTVmodelresulted in improvements of prognostic power, in terms of AUROC, both for the validation (0.77 from 0.75) and the testing (0.73 from 0.71) set.

"""Endothelium-induced three-dimensional invasion of heterogeneous glioma initiating cells in a microfluidic coculture platform.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive primary brain tumor that displays cellular heterogeneity, which is composed of glioma initiating cells (GICs) and their differentiated progeny. GICs play an important role in driving aggressive invasion. In particular, the interaction between GICs and blood vessels is critical because blood vessels are known to serve as routes for the invasion of GICs. However, the effect of endothelial cells on the three-dimensional (3D) invasion process of GICs as well as the spatial relationship between GICs and their differentiated progeny remains unclear. Here, we utilized a microfluidic device to recapitulate the 3D brain tumor microenvironments constituted by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and type I collagen. Using the device, we found that HUVECs promoted the 3D invasion of heterogeneous glioma cell populations into type I collagen gel. The invasion induced by HUVECs was predominantly preceded by cells positive for nestin, a neural stem cell marker. In contrast, cells positive for tubulin Î²3 (TUBB3), a differentiated cell marker, rarely preceded invasion. In addition, HUVECs induced the upregulation of TUBB3 in GICs. Finally, we found that the genes associated with invasion, such as integrins Î±2 and Î²3, were significantly upregulated in the presence of HUVECs.

Here we show that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4), an RNA binding protein that mediates meiotic mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation, is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and glioblastomas, where it supports tumor growth, vascularization and invasion. We also show that, in pancreatic tumors, the pro-oncogenic functions of CPEB4 originate in the translational activation of mRNAs that are silenced in normal tissue, including the mRNA of tissue plasminogen activator, a key contributor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma malignancy.

"""Biocomputing: numerical simulation of glioblastoma growth using diffusion tensor imaging.""","""Glioblastoma multiforma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive tumors of the central nervous system. It can be represented by two components: a proliferative component with a mass effect on brain structures and an invasive component. GBM has a distinct pattern of spread showing a preferential growth in the white fiber direction for the invasive component. By using the architecture of white matter fibers, we propose a new model to simulate the growth of GBM. This architecture is estimated by diffusion tensor imaging in order to determine the preferred direction for the diffusion component. It is then coupled with a mechanical component. To set up our growth model, we make a brain atlas including brain structures with a distinct response to tumor aggressiveness, white fiber diffusion tensor information and elasticity. In this atlas, we introduce a virtual GBM with a mechanical component coupled with a diffusion component. These two components are complementary, and can be tuned independently. Then, we tune the parameter set of our model with an MRI patient. We have compared simulated growth (initialized with the MRI patient) with observed growth six months later. The average and the odd ratio of image difference between observed and simulated images are computed. Displacements of reference points are compared to those simulated by the model. The results of our simulation have shown a good correlation with tumor growth, as observed on an MRI patient. Different tumor aggressiveness can also be simulated by tuning additional parameters.

Material and methods: RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the presence of IDH1-R132H mutation on the blocks of 70 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, and IDH1 stain was applied to the same blocks as IHC. Radiologically, preoperative magnetic resonance images of the patients were reviewed in terms of tumor size, localization, and presence of non-contrast-enhancing solid tumor component. Results: Evaluation by RT-PCR revealed that 15 (21.4%) patients were IDH-mutant, whereas IHC examination revealed 13 (18.6%) and radiological evaluation revealed 11 (15.7%) patients were IDH-mutant. There was a statistically significant difference between the IDH1 mutation detected by RT-PCR and by IHC or radiological methods (p=0.034 and p=0.000, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of IHC method in detecting IDH1 mutation were 86.6% and 100%, respectively, whereas those of radiological methods were 33.3% and 89%, respectively.

As far as human brain tumors are concerned, the orthotopic models currently available are established either by stereotaxic injection of cell suspensions or implantation of a solid piece of tumor through a complicated craniotomy procedure. In our technique we harvest cells from tissue culture to create a cell suspension used to implant directly into the brain.

The mouse is placed in a stereotaxic jig made by Stoetling (figure 1). After the surgical area is cleaned and prepared, an incision is made; and the bregma is located to determine the location of the craniotomy.

These were applied to diagnostic tumor specimens from a well-characterized cohort of 121 patients who received standard treatment consisting of surgery, radiation therapy, plus concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. The promoter methylation levels of ELMO1 and ELMO2 were generally low, whereas ELMO3 methylation levels were high, in the tumor biopsies.

Methods: Here we compare the IDH1 mutational status in 172 contrast-enhancing glioma patients with the invasion profile generated by a patient-specific mathematical model we developed based on MR imaging. Results: We show that IDH1-mutated contrast-enhancing gliomas were relatively more invasive than wild-type IDH1 for all 172 contrast-enhancing gliomas as well as the subset of 158 histologically confirmed glioblastomas. The appearance of this relatively increased, model-predicted invasive profile appears to be determined more by a lower model-predicted net proliferation rate rather than an increased model-predicted dispersal rate of the glioma cells. Receiver operator curve analysis of the model-predicted MRI-based invasion profile revealed an area under the curve of 0.91, indicative of a predictive relationship. The robustness of this relationship was tested by cross-validation analysis of the invasion profile as a predictive metric for IDH1 status. Conclusions: The strong correlation between IDH1 mutation status and the MRI-based invasion profile suggests that use of our tumor growth model may lead to noninvasive clinical detection of IDH1 mutation status and thus lead to better treatment planning, particularly prior to surgical resection, for contrast-enhancing gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24832620

These patients ranged in age from 3.5 to 70 years with an average age of 40 years. The male/female ratio was 5/8. Five glioblastomas were in the temporal lobes, three were in the frontal lobes, three were in the frontotemporal regions, two were in the occipital lobes, one was in the frontoparietal region, and one was in the temporoparietooccipital region. Six glioblastomas also had spontaneous distant metastases. In the absence of previous craniotomy and radiotherapy, rapid growth of the glioblastomas may promote such spontaneous penetration into the cranial dura mater and bones.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3041114

SiRNA knockdown resulted in decreased cell adhesion whereas increased adhesion was observed on surfaces coated with collagen XVI. The migration of glioblastoma cells on this substrate remained unchanged.

"""Hypoxia-mediated upregulation of MCT1 expression supports the glycolytic phenotype of glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastomas (GBM) present a high cellular heterogeneity with conspicuous necrotic regions associated with hypoxia, which is related to tumor aggressiveness. GBM tumors exhibit high glycolytic metabolism with increased lactate production that is extruded to the tumor microenvironment through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). While hypoxia-mediated regulation of MCT4 has been characterized, the role of MCT1 is still controversial. Thus, we aimed to understand the role of hypoxia in the regulation of MCT expression and function in GBM, MCT1 in particular. Methods: Expression of hypoxia- and glycolytic-related markers, as well as MCT1 and MCT4 isoforms was assessed in in vitro and in vivo orthotopic glioma models, and also in human GBM tissues by immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Following MCT1 inhibition, either pharmacologically with CHC (Î±-cyano-4-hydroxynnamic acid) or genetically with siRNAs, we assessed GBM cell viability, proliferation, metabolism, migration and invasion, under normoxia and hypoxia conditions. Results: Hypoxia induced an increase in MCT1 plasma membrane expression in glioma cells, both in in vitro and in vivo models. Additionally, treatment with CHC and downregulation of MCT1 in glioma cells decreased lactate production, cell proliferation and invasion under hypoxia. Moreover, in the in vivo orthotopic model and in human GBM tissues, there was extensive co-expression of MCT1, but not MCT4, with the GBM hypoxia marker CAIX. Conclusion: Hypoxia-induced MCT1 supports GBM glycolytic phenotype, being responsible for lactate efflux and an important mediator of cell survival and aggressiveness. Therefore, MCT1 constitutes a promising therapeutic target in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27331625

After identifying vesicle amine transport protein-1 (VAT-1) as being upregulated in invasive human gliomas, we study its possible function in glioblastoma cell migration. Methods: Based on data obtained from previous oligonucleotide arrays, we investigated expression of VAT-1 in glioblastoma tissue and cell lines on mRNA levels using reverse transcriptase PCR. Furthermore, we examined the amount and localization of VAT-1 protein using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Using small interfering RNA technology we repressed VAT-1 expression in human glioma cell lines and analysed their migration using wound healing and transwell migration assays. Results: Increased VAT-1 mRNA and protein levels were found in glioblastoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal human brain. Small interfering RNA-mediated VAT-1 knockdown led to significantly reduced migration of human glioma cells.

"""Stable transfection of urokinase-type plasminogen activator antisense construct modulates invasion of human glioblastoma cells.""","""The diffuse and extensive infiltration of malignant gliomas into the surrounding normal brain is believed to rely on modifications of the proteolysis of extracellular matrix components. A key molecule in regulating plasminogen-mediated extracellular proteolysis is the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). To investigate the role of uPA in the invasive process of brain tumors, we stably transfected a human glioblastoma cell line SNB19 with a vector capable of expressing an antisense transcript complementary to the 1020 bases at the 3' end of the uPA cDNA. Parental, vector-, and antisense construct-stably transfected cell lines were analyzed for uPA mRNA transcript by Northern blot analysis, for uPA enzyme activity by zymography, and for uPA protein levels by Western blotting. The levels of uPA mRNA, protein, and enzyme activities were significantly lower in antisense clones than in parental and vector controls. Radioreceptor binding studies demonstrated that uPA receptor levels remained the same in parental, vector-, and antisense-transfected cells. The antisense-transfected cells showed a markedly lower level of invasion in the Matrigel invasion assays, and their spheroids failed to invade the fetal rat brain aggregates in the coculture system. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing parental and antisense transfectants was generated for detection in mouse brain tissue without any posttreatment. Intracerebral injection of antisense stable transfectants significantly reduced tumor formation compared with that in controls.

We have previously shown that expressing a specific sialyltransferase gene in gliomas inhibited tumor formation, in vivo. In order to identify other 'glyco-gene' targets with therapeutic potential, focused 45-mer oligonucleotide microarrays were constructed containing all of the cloned human glyco-genes. Gene expression profiles of normal human brain and malignant gliomas were compared and microarray datasets analyzed using significance analysis of microarrays algorithms. There were 11 genes more highly expressed in gliomas compared to normal brain and 25 genes more highly expressed in normal brain compared to gliomas. Among the most noteworthy were high levels of MAN2A2 and ST6GalNAcV in normal brain tissue and high levels of POFUT1 and CHI3L1 in the gliomas, all changes corroborated by qRT-PCR. Historically, identification of changes in tumor-associated glycoconjugate expression was obtained by measuring individual enzyme activities or structural changes of specific molecules.

"""Expression pattern of invasion-related molecules in the peritumoral brain.""","""Objective: The effectiveness of therapy of intracerebral neoplasms is mainly influenced by the invasive behaviour of the tumour. The peritumoral invasion depends on the interaction between the tumour cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the surrounding brain. The invading tumour cells induce change in the activity of proteases, synthases and expression of ECM-components. These alterations in the peritumoral ECM are in connection to the highly different invasiveness of gliomas and metastatic brain tumours. To understand the fairly modified invasive potential of anaplastic intracerebral tumours of different origin, the effect of tumour on the peritumoral ECM and alterations of invasion related ECM components in the peritumoral brain were evaluated. Methods: For this reason the mRNA expression of 19 invasion-related molecules by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was determined in normal brain tissue (Norm), in the peritumoral brain tissue of glioblastoma (peri-GBM) and of intracerebral adenocarcinoma metastasis (peri-Met). To evaluate the translational expression of the investigated molecules protein levels were determined by targeted proteomic methods. Results: Establishing the invasion pattern of the investigated tissue samples 8 molecules showed concordant difference at mRNA and protein levels in the peri-GBM and peri-Met, 11 molecules in the peri-Met and normal brain and 12 in the peri-GBM and normal brain comparison. Conclusion: Our results bring some ECM molecules into focus that probably play key role in arresting tumour cell invasion around the metastatic tumour, and also in the lack of impeding tumour cell migration in case of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26451999
"""[Intraoperative vascular fluorescence in cerebral glioblastomas and vascular histological features].""","""5-ALA intraoperative fluorescence is widely used in surgery of brain tumors for intraoperative demarcation of boundaries and more total resection because 5-ALA metabolites are not accumulated in the intact brain and vascular tissues. Given this fact, it was hypothesized that fluorescence of vessels in the immediate vicinity of a brain tumor may indicate their infiltration by tumor cells as a potential pathway for their dissemination and as a factor for continued tumor growth after surgery and adjuvant therapy. Purpose: Identification of fluorescent vessels located near cerebral gliomas, with a histological description of their structure, relationships with the tumor, and potential invasion of the walls by tumor cells. Material and methods: A prospective cohort study included 14 patients with malignant supratentorial gliomas, aged 20 to 78 years. Five patients were operated on due to continued tumor growth. Two hours before surgery, all patients received 5-ALA orally. During surgery, a microscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI Pentero, Germany) with a fluorescent module (BLUE-400) was used. In all cases, molecular-genetic and immunohistochemical examinations of the tumor material were performed. During surgery, fluorescent vessels, after evaluating their functional significance, were also resected for histological examination. Results: Glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma were verified in 10 and 4 patients, respectively. In 4 out of 10 glioblastoma cases, vessels with homogeneous or fragmentary fluorescent walls were detected in the tumor bed after resection of most of the tumor; in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas, vascular fluorescence was not observed. In the four vascular samples with intraoperatively detected wall fluorescence, tumor invasion into the vascular layers was revealed in all cases. These patients underwent an immunohistochemical examination with monoclonal antibodies to the glial GFAP marker, which clearly identified areas of ingrowth of tumor cells into the vascular wall. Conclusion: 5-ALA intraoperative fluorescence is a fundamentally new approach in the rapid diagnosis of tumor-infiltrated blood vessels. Invasion of tumor cells to intact vessels may be a mechanism of tumor progression and dissemination. Additional resection of fluorescent vessels may affect the radicalness of surgical treatment, but requires a mandatory assessment of their functional significance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32031165
"""Multimodal MRI can identify perfusion and metabolic changes in the invasive margin of glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To use perfusion and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy to compare the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-defined invasive and noninvasive regions. Invasion of normal brain is a cardinal feature of glioblastomas (GBM) and a major cause of treatment failure. DTI can identify invasive regions.

"""Irradiation of primary human gliomas triggers dynamic and aggressive survival responses involving microvesicle signaling.""","""Malignant gliomas are heterogeneous populations of dynamically interacting cells. Genomic and transcriptional changes define this cellular hierarchy and allow certain tumor cells to co-opt metabolic machinery and adopt gene expression profiles that promote cellular reprogramming. Resultant expansion of privileged subpopulations can then rapidly adapt to microenvironmental stress that ultimately influence tumor response to therapeutic intervention. In this study, primary gliomas were subjected to acute or chronic irradiation and analyzed for changes in survival parameters, oxidative stress, gene expression, and cell invasion before and after treatment with secreted microvesicles isolated from irradiated and nonirradiated glioma cells. We found that primary gliomas exposed to ionizing radiation undergo metabolic changes that increase oxidative stress, alter gene expression, and affect the contents of and response to cellular secreted microvesicles. Radiation-induced changes were exacerbated under chronic as compared to acute irradiation paradigms and promoted cellular reprogramming through enhanced expression of key transcription factors and regulators involved in differentiation and pluripotency (SOX2, POU3F2, SALL2, OLIG2, NANOG, POU5F1v1, MSI1). Irradiation also affected changes in paracrine signaling mediated by cellular secreted microvesicles that significantly altered target cell phenotype. Primary gliomas treated with microvesicles exhibited increased radioresistance and treatment with microvesicles from chronically irradiated gliomas promoted invasion via induction of increased matrix metalloproteinase II activity. Together, our data describe a complex radiation response of primary glioma cells involving metabolic and transcriptional changes that alter radiation sensitivity and induce invasive behavior. These important changes can contribute to tumor growth and recurrence, and confound interventions designed to forestall disease progression. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 57:405-415, 2016.

These tumors are heterogeneous being constituted by a variety of cells in different states of differentiation. Among these, cells endowed with stem properties, tumor initiating/propagating properties and particularly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapies are designed as the real culprits for tumor maintenance and relapse after treatment. These cells, termed cancer stem-like cells, have been designed as prominent targets for new and more efficient cancer therapies. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of membrane receptors, play a prominent role in cell signaling, cell communication and crosstalk with the microenvironment. Their role in cancer has been highlighted but remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a descriptive study of the differential expression of the endo-GPCR repertoire in human glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GSCs), U-87 MG cells, human astrocytes and fetal neural stem cells (f-NSCs). The endo-GPCR transcriptome has been studied using Taqman Low Density Arrays. Of the 356 GPCRs investigated, 138 were retained for comparative studies between the different cell types. At the transcriptomic level, eight GPCRs were specifically expressed/overexpressed in GSCs. Seventeen GPCRs appeared specifically expressed in cells with stem properties (GSCs and f-NSCs). Results of GPCR expression at the protein level using mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis are also presented.

The expression of eEF-2 kinase was silenced using siRNA, and the invasive potential of tumor cells was assessed using a wound-healing assay and a Matrigel invasion assay. Apoptosis was determined using propidium iodide (PI) staining and Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3. Results: Silencing the expression of eEF-2 kinase by siRNA significantly suppressed both the migration and invasion of human glioma cells.

Using high-resolution time-lapse intravital imaging, tumor cell migration in the tumor core, border and invasive front was recorded. Tumor cell dynamics at different border configurations were analyzed and multivariate linear modelling of tumor cell spreading was performed. We found tumor border configurations, recapitulating human tumor border morphologies. Not only tumor borders but also the tumor core was composed of highly dynamic cells, with no clear correlation to the ability to spread into the brain. Two types of border configurations contributed to tumor cell spreading through distinct invasion patterns: an invasive margin that executes slow but directed invasion, and a diffuse infiltration margin with fast but less directed movement.

Whereas EFA6A is specifically expressed in the brain, little is known about its function in glial cells or glioma. Here we show that elevated EFA6A expression is detectable in both low-grade and high-grade human glioma tissues samples. To investigate the role of EFA6A in glioma carcinogenesis, we generated a human glioblastoma cell line which conditionally overexpresses EFA6A (U373-EFA6A). We showed that overexpression of EFA6A had no effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, or cell cycle control. However, as shown by wound healing and in vitro cell invasion assays, it significantly enhanced the cell motility and invasiveness whereas silencing EFA6A by its dominant negative mutant EFA6A(E242K) produced opposite effects. We further showed that ARF6/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is required for the EFA6A-mediated cell invasion because both EFA6A(E242K) and ARF6 dominant negative mutant ARF6(T27N) markedly reduced the phosphorylated ERK level and EFA6A-mediated invasive capacity.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (Pi3-K) and protein kinase C (PKC) are two phosphorylated proteins involved in glioblastoma cell progression. Phosphorylated focal adhesion protein kinase (FAK) has also been reported to be involved in tumour progression. In a recent study, we demonstrated a correlation between phosphorylated FAK, proliferation rate and 99mTc-(V)-dimercaptosuccinate [(V)-DMSA] uptake. We hypothesised that 99mTc-(V)-DMSA could be a potential imaging agent to evaluate glioblastoma aggressiveness. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between 99mTc-(V)-DMSA incorporation rate and modulation of Pi3-K and PKC activity. Methods: Proliferation, migration and invasion capacities in the presence of protein kinase modulators-staurosporine (PKC inhibitor), 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; PKC activator) and LY294002 (Pi3-K inhibitor)-were correlated with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA cell accumulation in an in vitro model of several malignant glioma cells: G111 (grade II), U-87-MG (grade III) and G152 (grade IV). Results: In all cell lines tested, LY294002 and staurosporine treatment inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In contrast, treatment with PMA stimulated tumour aggressiveness. 99mTc-(V)-DMSA uptake was strongly correlated with the % of cellular proliferation (r=0.8462) and the % of cellular migration (r=0.9081), and to a lesser extent with the % of cellular invasion (r=0.7761). Conclusion: Our results clearly demonstrated that 99mTc-(V)-DMSA reflects Pi3-K and PKC activity and is correlated with tumour aggressiveness. 99mTc-(V)-DMSA could be a reliable in vivo marker providing additional information on the biological status of malignant glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16763818
"""Contribution of gap junctional communication between tumor cells and astroglia to the invasion of the brain parenchyma by human glioblastomas.""","""Background: Gliomas are 'intraparenchymally metastatic' tumors, invading the brain in a non-destructive way that suggests cooperation between glioma cells and their environment. Recent studies using an engineered rodent C6 tumor cell line have pointed to mechanisms of invasion that involved gap junctional communication (GJC), with connexin 43 as a substrate. We explored whether this concept may have clinical relevance by analyzing the participation of GJC in human glioblastoma invasion. Results: Three complementary in vitro assays were used: (i) seeding on collagen IV, to analyze homocellular interactions between tumor cells (ii) co-cultures with astrocytes, to study glioblastoma/astrocytes relationships and (iii) implantation into organotypic brain slice cultures, that mimic the three-dimensional parenchymal environment. Carbenoxolone, a potent blocker of GJC, inhibited cell migration in the two latter models. It paradoxically increased it in the first one. These results showed that homocellular interaction between tumor cells supports intercellular adhesion, whereas heterocellular glioblastoma/astrocytes interactions through functional GJC conversely support tumor cell migration. As demonstrated for the rodent cell line, connexin 43 may be responsible for this heterocellular functional coupling. Its levels of expression, high in astrocytes, correlated positively with invasiveness in biopsied tumors. Conclusions: our results underscore the potential clinical relevance of the concept put forward by other authors based on experiments with a rodent cell line, that glioblastoma cells use astrocytes as a substrate for their migration by subverting communication through connexin 43-dependent gap junctions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15715906

These beads act as reference markers for the gel, allowing us to image the spatial displacement of the tumor environment using high-resolution time-lapse video microscopy. The results show that the volumetrically expanding tumor spheroid pushes the gel outward and that this tumor-generated pressure propagates to a distance greater than the initial radius of the tumor spheroid. Intriguingly, beads near the tips of invasive cells are displaced inward, toward the advancing invasive cells.

Recent works emphasized aberrant cell-surface glyco-conjugate expression in brain tumors suggesting that altered glycosylation is closely linked to cancer tumor metastasis and invasive process. Post-translational changes might play a key role in determining the fates of most aggressive and undifferentiated cells such as self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. In order to characterize the glycosylation-related genes involved in differentiation status of the BTSCs, two glioblastoma cell lines, U87-MG and U251 have been cultured according to two conditions leading to undifferentiated floating cells or differentiated adherent cells. The expression level of 559 glycosylation related genes has been analyzed by Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) analysis and allowed to isolate eight up-regulated genes specific of a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells. Protein expression has been confirmed. Among main selected genes, five are also over-expressed in the undifferentiated condition in primary cultures provided by three GBM freshly isolated from patient. This work suggests that new Glycosylation-related gene signature might improve the characterization of the most aggressive and undifferentiated cells and supports that in future, N-linked glycosylation might provide new target to develop therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21899947
"""Violacein induces p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated solid tumor cell death and inhibits tumor cell migration.""","""Microbial secondary metabolites have emerged as alternative novel drugs for the treatment of human cancers. Violacein, a purple pigment produced by Chromobacterium violaceum, was investigated in the present study for its anti-tumor properties in tumor cell lines. Clinically applicable concentrations of violacein were demonstrated to inhibit the proliferative capacity of tumor cell lines according to a crystal violet proliferation assay. The underlying mechanism was the promotion of apoptotic cell death, as indicated by poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling determined by western blot analysis. Collectively, this provided mechanistic evidence that violacein elicits extracellular-signal regulated kinase-induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. The anti-malignant properties of violacein in the present study were further demonstrated by its inhibitory effects on brain tumor cell migration, specifically glioblastomas, one of the most invasive and therapeutically resistant neoplasms in the clinic. Additionally, solid tumors examined in the present study displayed differential cellular responses and sensitivities to violacein as observed by morphologically induced cellular changes that contributed to its anti-migratory properties. In conclusion, violacein is a novel natural product with the potential to kill several types of human tumor cell lines, as well as prevent disease recurrence by antagonizing cellular processes that contribute to metastatic invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816226
"""Invasive tumor cells and prognosis in a selected population of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: After surgical resection, the residual, invasive glioblastoma (GBM) cells give rise to a recurrent tumor, which, in 96% of patients, arises adjacent to the resection margin. Methods: In this study, the authors prospectively enrolled 25 patients with GBM who underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy (with temozolomide). Tumor removal was achieved with resection margins that included the neighboring, apparently normal tissue (between 1 cm and 2 cm from the tumor border [B area]) and the tumor. Results: Patients who had an absence of tumor cells in the neighboring, apparently normal white matter (B area) had better survival than patients who had the presence of tumor cells in the B area (21 months vs 12 months). This difference was statistically significant in univariate analysis (P = .005) and in multivariate analysis (P = .01). Conclusions: Aggressive tumor removal may improve survival, but the current results indicated that biologic commitment of 'penumbra' cells appear to be the most relevant factor for tumor recurrence and accounts for the fatal outcome of the disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18618580
"""Non-invasive prediction of p53 and Ki-67 labelling indices and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status in adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastomas using diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging combined with conventional MRI.""","""Aim: To assess whether conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) could non-invasively predict p53 and Ki-67 labelling index (LI) and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in adult isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastomas. Methods: The conventional MRI, DWI, and DSC-PWI results of 120 adult patients with IDH wild-type glioblastomas were reviewed retrospectively and their efficacy was analysed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test. Relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADCmin) and relative maximum cerebral blood volume (rCBVmax) values were compared between glioblastomas with different molecular statuses using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression were used to evaluate predictive performance. Results: Glioblastomas with a high p53 LI were more likely to show a well-defined enhancement margin (p=0.047). Glioblastomas in the high-Ki-67-LI group demonstrated significantly lower rADCmin (p<0.001) and higher rCBVmax (p=0.001) values than those in the low-Ki-67-LI group. Tumours without MGMT promoter methylation showed lower rADCmin (p<0.001) and higher rCBVmax (p<0.001) values than those with it. The rCBVmax value exhibited a greater efficacy in predicting the MGMT promoter methylation status of adult IDH wild-type glioblastomas than the rADCmin value (p=0.001). Conclusions: The present results suggest that conventional and DWI and DSC-PWI results are influenced by the molecular status of the glioblastoma and indicate that DWI and DSC-PWI may help to identify regions of high invasiveness within heterogeneous glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35469666
"""Abnormal expression of an ADAR2 alternative splicing variant in gliomas downregulates adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing.""","""Background: RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for recoding editing in humans. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing at the Q/R site is reported to be decreased in gliomas; however, the expression of ADAR2 mRNA was not greatly affected. Methods: We determined ADAR2 mRNA expression in human glioblastoma cell lines and in normal human glial cells by real-time RT-PCR. We also determined ADAR2 mRNA expression in 44 glioma tissues and normal white matter. After identifying an alternative splicing variant (ASV) of ADAR2 in gliomas, we performed sequencing. We then classified glioblastomas based on the presence (+) or absence (-) of the ASV to determine the correlations between ASV + and malignant features of glioblastomas, such as invasion, peritumoral brain edema, and survival time. Results: There were no significant differences in ADAR2 mRNA expression among human glioblastoma cell lines or in gliomas compared with normal white matter (all p > 0.05). The ASV, which contained a 47-nucleotide insertion in the ADAR2 mRNA transcript, was detected in the U251 and BT325 cell lines, and in some glioma tissues. The expression rate of ASV differed among gliomas of different grades. ASV + glioblastomas were more malignant than ASV - glioblastomas. Conclusions: ADAR2 is a family of enzymes in which ASVs result in differences in enzymatic activity. The ADAR2 ASV may be correlated with the invasiveness of gliomas. Identification of the mechanistic characterization of ADAR2 ASV may have future potential for individualized molecular targeted-therapy for glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24509948
"""Role of key genetic mutations on increasing migration of brain cancer cells through confinement.""","""Uncontrolled invasive cancer cell migration is among the major challenges for the treatment and management of brain cancer. Although the genetic profiles of brain cancer cells have been well characterized, the relationship between the genetic mutations and the cells' mobility has not been clearly understood. In this study, using microfluidic devices that provide a wide range of physical confinements from 20 Ã 5 Î¼m2 to 3 Ã 5 Î¼m2 in cross sections, we studied the effect of physical confinement on the migratory capacity of cell lines with different types of mutations. Human glioblastoma and genetically modified mouse astrocytes were used. Human glioblastoma cells with EGFRvIII mutation were found to exhibit high degree of migratory capacity in narrow confinement. From mouse astrocytes, cells with triple mutations (p53-/- PTEN-/- BRAF) were found to exhibit the highest level of migratory capacity in narrow confinement compared to both double (p53-/- PTEN-/-) and single (p53-/-) mutant cells. Furthermore, when treating the triple mutant astrocytes with AZD-6244, an inhibitor of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, we found significant reduction in migration through the confined channels when compared to that of controls (83% decrease in 5 Ã 5 Î¼m2 and 86% in 3 Ã 5 Î¼m2 channels). Our data correlate genetic mutations from different cell lines to their motility in different degrees of confinement.

"""Matrix-degrading proteases ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (disintegrins and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs 4 and 5) are expressed in human glioblastomas.""","""Brain tumors, in particular glioblastomas, have a high morbidity and mortality, mainly due to their invasive nature. A prerequisite for this invasiveness is cell migration based on increased expression of proteases digesting the extracellular matrix. Brevican, an important extracellular proteoglycan that is upregulated in glioblastomas, can be degraded by certain proteases. We demonstrate that in human glioblastomas secretory proteases like ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (aggrecanases 1 and 2; ADAMTS = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) are expressed on the mRNA and protein levels in considerable amounts. Real-time RT-PCR shows a higher levels of ADAMTS4 and 5 expressions in glioblastomas in situ, compared to cultured human glioblastoma cells. The upregulation of these proteases in vivo by cytokines may explain this difference. In vitro, transforming growth factor-beta induces ADAMTS4, but less ADAMTS5, and interleukin-1beta ADAMTS5, but not ADAMTS4. As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in situ, ADAMTS5 expression is confined to proliferating glioblastoma cells of surgical tumor sections and with lower intensity to astroglial cells in normal brain sections, as opposed to brevican. In vitro, glioblastoma-derived ADAMTS5 degrades recombinant human brevican to several smaller fragments. Our results show that ADAMTS4 and 5 are upregulated on proliferating glioblastoma cells and these proteases may contribute to their invasive potential.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16003758
"""IDH genotypes differentiation in glioblastomas using DWI and DSC-PWI in the enhancing and peri-enhancing region.""","""Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation has diagnostic and prognostic values in glioblastomas. Peritumoral invasion of glioma cells is a cardinal feature of glioblastomas. Purpose: To evaluate the contribution of DWI and DSC-PWI in the enhancing and peri-enhancing region for discriminating glioblastomas IDH genotypes, and the diagnostic values of combining two techniques in the peri-enhancing region compared with those in the enhancing region. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the conventional MRI (cMRI), DWI and DSC-PWI obtained from 10 patients with IDH-mutated (IDH-m) glioblastomas and 65 patients with IDH wild-type (IDH-w) glioblastomas. Features of cMRI, relative minimum ADC in the enhancing region (rADCmin-t) and peri-enhancing area (rADCmin-p), and relative maximum CBV values in the enhancing region (rCBVmax-t) and peri-enhancing region (rCBVmax-p) were compared between two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis were used to assess diagnostic performance. Results: IDH-m glioblastomas tended to present in frontal lobes and younger patients. The rADCmin-t (P = 0.042) were significantly lower in IDH-w than IDH-m. Both rCBVmax-t and rCBVmax-p showed significant differences between two subgroups (all P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values in prediction of IDH-m were >0.98 for rADCmin-t, <7.27 for rCBVmax-t, and < 0.97 for rCBVmax-p. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the combination of rADCmin-t and rCBVmax-t yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The rCBVmax-t or rCBVmax-p may serve as preferable and comparable imaging biomarkers for evaluation of glioblastomas IDH status. The combination of rADCmin-t and rCBVmax-t may yield the maximum predictive power for differentiating IDH status.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31084193
"""Gene expression profile identifies tyrosine kinase c-Met as a targetable mediator of antiangiogenic therapy resistance.""","""Purpose: To identify mediators of glioblastoma antiangiogenic therapy resistance and target these mediators in xenografts. Experimental design: We conducted microarray analysis comparing bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRG) with pretreatment tumors from the same patients. We established novel xenograft models of antiangiogenic therapy resistance to target candidate resistance mediator(s). Results: BRG microarray analysis revealed upregulation versus pretreatment of receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, which underwent further investigation because of its prior biologic plausibility as a bevacizumab resistance mediator. BRGs exhibited increased hypoxia versus pretreatment in a manner correlating with their c-Met upregulation, increased c-Met phosphorylation, and increased phosphorylation of c-Met-activated focal adhesion kinase and STAT3. We developed 2 novel xenograft models of antiangiogenic therapy resistance. In the first model, serial bevacizumab treatment of an initially responsive xenograft generated a xenograft with acquired bevacizumab resistance, which exhibited upregulated c-Met expression versus pretreatment. In the second model, a BRG-derived xenograft maintained refractoriness to the MRI tumor vasculature alterations and survival-promoting effects of bevacizumab. Growth of this BRG-derived xenograft was inhibited by a c-Met inhibitor. Transducing these xenograft cells with c-Met short hairpin RNA inhibited their invasion and survival in hypoxia, disrupted their mesenchymal morphology, and converted them from bevacizumab-resistant to bevacizumab-responsive. Engineering bevacizumab-responsive cells to express constitutively active c-Met caused these cells to form bevacizumab-resistant xenografts. Conclusion: These findings support the role of c-Met in survival in hypoxia and invasion, features associated with antiangiogenic therapy resistance, and growth and therapeutic resistance of xenografts resistant to antiangiogenic therapy. Therapeutically targeting c-Met could prevent or overcome antiangiogenic therapy resistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23307858
"""Diffusion tensor invasive phenotypes can predict progression-free survival in glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas multiformes (GBM) remain incurable in most cases. Their invasion into normal brain makes current therapies ineffective. Post-mortem studies suggest about a 25% of GBMs invade less than 1 cm from the tumour bulk and 20% invade more than 3 cm. Aim of study: The study aims to use DTI to assess tumour extension and determine how previously reported patterns relate to the progression-free survival (PFS). Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients with GBM treated according to the EORTC/NCIC protocol were retrospectively analysed. Patients were imaged post-operatively at 1.5 T. The sequences were composed of standard anatomical and a standard DTI sequence. As described earlier p and q maps were constructed. For each of the p and q maps, regions of interest were drawn around the visible abnormality. Patients were assigned a diffuse, localised or minimally invasive pattern. Progression was defined according to the RANO criteria (4) and PFS determined in days. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival for the three groups were plotted as were the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 24 months. Results: The median PFS for the diffuse group was 278 days, for the localised group 605 days and 820 days for the minimally invasive group. Three-fourth of the minimally invasive group were progression-free at 24 months (LOG RANK 9.25; p = 0.010). Conclusion: It is possible to identify three invasive phenotypes in GBMs using Diffusion tensor imaging , and these three phenotypes have different progression free survival.

We recently developed a novel brain cancer model in the inbred VM mouse strain that shares several characteristics with human GBM. Using bioluminescence imaging, we tested the efficacy of CR (calorie restriction) for its ability to reduce tumour size and invasion. CR targets glycolysis and rapid tumour cell growth in part by lowering circulating glucose levels. The VM-M3 tumour cells were implanted intracerebrally in the syngeneic VM mouse host. Approx. 12-15 days post-implantation, brains were removed and both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were imaged to measure bioluminescence of invading tumour cells. CR significantly reduced the invasion of tumour cells from the implanted ipsilateral hemisphere into the contralateral hemisphere. The total percentage of Ki-67-stained cells within the primary tumour and the total number of blood vessels was also significantly lower in the CR-treated mice than in the mice fed ad libitum, suggesting that CR is anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic. Our findings indicate that the VM-M3 GBM model is a valuable tool for studying brain tumour cell invasion and for evaluating potential therapeutic approaches for managing invasive brain cancer. In addition, we show that CR can be effective in reducing malignant brain tumour growth and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20664705
"""Misregulated E-cadherin expression associated with an aggressive brain tumor phenotype.""","""Background: Cadherins are essential components of the adherens junction complexes that mediate cell-cell adhesion and regulate cell motility. During tissue morphogenesis, changes in cadherin expression (known as cadherin switching) are a common mechanism for altering cell fate. Cadherin switching is also common during epithelial tumor progression, where it is thought to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. E-cadherin is the predominant cadherin expressed in epithelial tissues, but its expression is very limited in normal brain. Methodology/principal findings: We identified E-cadherin expression in a retrospective series of glioblastomas exhibiting epithelial or pseudoepithelial differentiation. Unlike in epithelial tissues, E-cadherin expression in gliomas correlated with an unfavorable clinical outcome. Western blotting of two panels of human GBM cell lines propagated either as xenografts in nude mice or grown under conventional cell culture conditions confirmed that E-cadherin expression is rare. However, a small number of xenograft lines did express E-cadherin, its expression correlating with increased invasiveness when the cells were implanted orthotopically in mouse brain. In the conventionally cultured SF767 glioma cell line, E-cadherin expression was localized throughout the plasma membrane rather than being restricted to areas of cell-cell contact. ShRNA knockdown of E-cadherin in these cells resulted in decreased proliferation and migration in vitro. Conclusions/significance: Our data shows an unexpected correlation between the abnormal expression of E-cadherin in a subset of GBM tumor cells and the growth and migration of this aggressive brain tumor subtype.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21060868
"""Complementary but distinct roles for MRI and 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET in the assessment of human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a primary brain tumor known for its rapid proliferation, diffuse invasion, and prominent neovasculature and necrosis. This study explores the in vivo link between these characteristics and hypoxia by comparing the relative spatial geometry of developing vasculature inferred from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1Gd), edematous tumor extent revealed on T2-weighted MRI (T2), and hypoxia assessed by 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET (18F-FMISO). Given the role of hypoxia in upregulating angiogenic factors, we hypothesized that the distribution of hypoxia seen on 18F-FMISO is correlated spatially and quantitatively with the amount of leaky neovasculature seen on T1Gd. Methods: A total of 24 patients with glioblastoma underwent T1Gd, T2, and 18F-FMISO-11 studies preceded surgical resection or biopsy, 7 followed surgery and preceded radiation therapy, and 11 followed radiation therapy. Abnormal regions seen on the MRI scan were segmented, including the necrotic center (T0), the region of abnormal blood-brain barrier associated with disrupted vasculature (T1Gd), and infiltrating tumor cells and edema (T2). The 18F-FMISO images were scaled to the blood 18F-FMISO activity to create tumor-to-blood ratio (T/B) images. The hypoxic volume (HV) was defined as the region with T/Bs greater than 1.2, and the maximum T/B (T/Bmax) was determined by the voxel with the greatest T/B value. Results: The HV generally occupied a region straddling the outer edge of the T1Gd abnormality and into the T2. A significant correlation between HV and the volume of the T1Gd abnormality that relied on the existence of a large outlier was observed. However, there was consistent correlation between surface areas of all MRI-defined regions and the surface area of the HV. The T/Bmax, typically located within the T1Gd region, was independent of the MRI-defined tumor size. Univariate survival analysis found the most significant predictors of survival to be HV, surface area of HV, surface area of T1Gd, and T/Bmax. Conclusion: Hypoxia may drive the peripheral growth of glioblastomas. This conclusion supports the spatial link between the volumes and surface areas of the hypoxic and MRI regions; the magnitude of hypoxia, T/Bmax, remains independent of size.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19091885
"""Isolation and characterization of human malignant glioma cells from histologically normal brain.""","""Brain invasion prevents complete surgical extirpation of malignant gliomas; however, invasive cells from distant, histologically normal brain previously have not been isolated, cultured, and characterized. To evaluate invasive human malignant glioma cells, the authors established cultures from gross tumor and histologically normal brain. Three men and one woman, with a mean age of 67 years, underwent two frontal and two temporal lobectomies for tumors, which yielded specimens of both gross tumor and histologically normal brain. Each specimen was acquired a minimum of 4 cm from the gross tumor. The specimens were split: a portion was sent for neuropathological evaluation (three glioblastomas multiforme and one oligodendroglioma) and a portion was used to establish cell lines. Morphologically, the specimens of gross tumor and histologically normal brain were identical in three of the four cell culture pairs. Histochemical staining characteristics were consistent both within each pair and when compared with the specimens sent for neuropathological evaluation. Cultures demonstrated anchorage-independent growth in soft agarose and neoplastic karyotypes. Growth rates in culture were greater for histologically normal brain than for gross tumor in three of the four culture pairs. Although the observed increases in growth rates of histologically normal brain cultures do not correlate with in vivo behavior, these findings corroborate the previously reported stem cell potential of invasive glioma cells. Using the radial dish assay, no significant differences in motility between cultures of gross tumor and histologically normal brain were found. In summary, tumor cells were cultured from histologically normal brain acquired from a distance greater than 4 cm from the gross tumor, indicating the relative insensitivity of standard histopathological identification of invasive glioma cells (and hence the inadequacy of frozen-section evaluation of resection margins). Cell lines derived from gross tumor and histologically normal brain were usually histologically identical and demonstrated equivalent motility, but had different growth rates.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9046311
"""Protein disulfide isomerase expression is related to the invasive properties of malignant glioma.""","""By serial transplantation of human glioblastoma biopsies into the brain of immunodeficient nude rats, two different tumor phenotypes were obtained. Initially, the transplanted xenografts displayed a highly invasive phenotype that showed no signs of angiogenesis. By serial transplantation in animals, the tumors changed to a less invasive, predominantly angiogenic phenotype. To identify novel proteins related to the invasive phenotype, the xenografts were analyzed using a global proteomics approach. One of the identified proteins was protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) A6 precursor. PDI is a chaperone protein that mediates integrin-dependent cell adhesion. It is both present in the cytosol and at the cell surface. We show that PDI is strongly expressed on invasive glioma cells, in both xenografts and at the invasive front of human glioblastomas. Using an in vitro migration assay, we also show that PDI is expressed on migrating glioma cells. To determine the functional significance of PDI in cell migration, we tested the effect of a PDI inhibitor, bacitracin, and a PDI monoclonal antibody on glioma cell migration and invasion in vitro. Both tumor spheroids derived from human glioblastoma xenografts in nude rat brain and cell line spheroids were used. The PDI antibody, as well as bacitracin, inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. The anti-invasive effect of bacitracin was reversible after withdrawal of the inhibitor, indicating a specific, nontoxic effect. In conclusion, using a global proteomics approach, PDI was identified to play an important role in glioma cell invasion, and its action was effectively inhibited by bacitracin.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17047051

Previous work has revealed robust overexpression of fibronectin (FN) mRNA in GBM, although immunohistochemical staining of FN in these tumors is typically associated with the angiogenic vasculature. Here we sought to examine the expression of tumor cell FN and address its possible involvement in the invasive phenotype of GBM. We found that FN was expressed and assembled into fibrillar arrays in human tumors and in established GBM lines. Cultured cells spontaneously formed dense cellular networks and spheroid-like domes. Depletion of FN by targeted-short hairpin RNA expression disrupted matrix assembly and multicellular network organization by exerting profound effects on cell adhesion and motility. Although FN depletion enhanced persistent directional migration of single cells, it compromised collective invasion of spheroids through a laminin-rich matrix and sensitized cells to ionizing radiation. In orthotopic grafts, FN depletion significantly reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis. Together our results show that FN produced by the tumor cells has a role in GBM pathophysiology and they provide insights into the implications that targeting FN interactions may have for combating this dreaded disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23912459
"""CXCR4 increases in-vivo glioma perivascular invasion, and reduces radiation induced apoptosis: A genetic knockdown study.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor. Perivascular invasion, autovascularization and vascular co-option occur throughout the disease and lead to tumor invasion and progression. The molecular basis for perivascular invasion, i.e., the interaction of glioma tumor cells with endothelial cells is not well characterized. Recent studies indicate that glioma cells have increased expression of CXCR4. We investigated the in-vivo role of CXCR4 in perivascular invasion of glioma cells using shRNA-mediated knock down of CXCR4. We show that primary cultures of human glioma stem cells HF2303 and mouse glioma GL26-Cit cells exhibit significant migration towards human (HBMVE) and mouse (MBVE) brain microvascular endothelial cells. Blocking CXCR4 on tumor cells with AMD3100 in-vitro, inhibits migration of GL26-Cit and HF2303 toward MBVE and HBMVE cells. Additionally, genetic down regulation of CXCR4 in mouse glioma GL26-Cit cells inhibits their in-vitro migration towards MBVE cells; in an in-vivo intracranial mouse model, these cells display reduced tumor growth and perivascular invasion, leading to increased survival. Quantitative analysis of brain sections showed that CXCR4 knockdown tumors are less invasive. Lastly, we tested the effects of radiation on CXCR4 knock down GL26-Cit cells in an orthotopic brain tumor model. Radiation treatment increased apoptosis of CXCR4 downregulated tumor cells and prolonged median survival. In summary, our data suggest that CXCR4 signaling is critical for perivascular invasion of GBM cells and targeting this receptor makes tumors less invasive and more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combination of CXCR4 knock down and radiation treatment might improve the efficacy of GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863376
"""Realistic simulation of the 3-D growth of brain tumors in MR images coupling diffusion with biomechanical deformation.""","""We propose a new model to simulate the three-dimensional (3-D) growth of glioblastomas multiforma (GBMs), the most aggressive glial tumors. The GBM speed of growth depends on the invaded tissue: faster in white than in gray matter, it is stopped by the dura or the ventricles. These different structures are introduced into the model using an atlas matching technique. The atlas includes both the segmentations of anatomical structures and diffusion information in white matter fibers. We use the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction with the invaded structures (mass effect). Depending on the considered tissue, the former effect is modeled with a reaction-diffusion or a Gompertz equation, while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new coupling equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. The tumor growth simulation is assessed by comparing the in-silico GBM growth with the real growth observed on two magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a patient acquired with 6 mo difference.

"""Development of an in vitro extracellular matrix assay for studies of brain tumor cell invasion.""","""Invasion of brain by tumor cells is an inherent feature of the malignant phenotype. Assays to quantitate invasiveness should provide a powerful tool to investigate this phenomenon. We have developed a modified in vitro assay to measure tumor cell invasion, attachment, and chemotaxis using a barrier of the complex basement membrane Matrigel on gelatin-coated filters. Within 5 hours, 7.8% of U251MGp and 2.6% of SF126 human malignant glioma cells invaded the Matrigel and filter, compared with 0.8% of normal human leptomeningeal cells. The extent of invasion was directly proportional to incubation time and filter pore size and inversely proportional to the Matrigel concentration. Cells from exponentially growing U251MGp cultures invaded more readily (10.9%) than cells from plateau-phase cultures (2.3%); however, labeling studies with bromodeoxyuridine showed that quiescent cells and rapidly dividing cells were equally capable of invading. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying invasion by malignant glioma cells are distinct from those underlying proliferation and indicates the need for therapy aimed specifically at invasive behavior. In a practical application of this assay to test a potential anti-invasive strategy, monoclonal antibodies to the beta subunit of an integrin receptor mediating attachment to the extracellular matrix inhibited invasion by U251MGp cells in a dose-dependent manner. This assay should allow evaluation of the cellular and molecular basis of brain tumor progression and perhaps aid the development of rationally designed drugs that limit tumor invasion.

MiR-152-3p was down-expressed in human malignancies, and served as a tumor suppressor. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) was significantly decreased in GBM tissues with a high level of methylation. However, the link between miR-152-3p, DNMT1 and methylation of NF2 in GBM is not clearly established. This study was conducted to detect the mechanism between miR-152-3p, DNMT1 and NF2 in GBM. Methods: The levels of DNMT1 and NF2 expression were studied by qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immumohistochemical staining. Methylation in the promoter region of NF2 was detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfate genomic sequencing PCR. Cell proliferation was examined by Cell-Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and cell invasion was evaluated by transwell assay. Flow cytomery and Hoechst staining were used to analyze cell apoptosis. A dual luciferase system was used to confirm the relationship between miR-152-3p and DNMT1. Results: Methylation of NF2 and DNMT1 was markedly increased, and miR-152-3p was downregulated in GBM tissues and glioma cells. Both knockdown of DNMT1 and overexpression miR-152-3p showed that demethylation activated the expression of NF2. Furthermore, miR-152-3p directly targeted DNMT1. Both miR-152-3p overexpression and DNMT1 knockdown significantly induced cell apoptosis and inhibited invasive activity. This was also observed after NF2 overexpression. Conclusions: These results indicated that miR-152-3p can inhibit glioma cell proliferation and invasion activities by decreasing DNMT1. The restoration of miR-152-3p may have therapeutic application in the treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28764788
"""CD155/PVR plays a key role in cell motility during tumor cell invasion and migration.""","""Background: Invasion is an important early step of cancer metastasis that is not well understood. Developing therapeutics to limit metastasis requires the identification and validation of candidate proteins necessary for invasion and migration. Methods: We developed a functional proteomic screen to identify mediators of tumor cell invasion. This screen couples Fluorophore Assisted Light Inactivation (FALI) to a scFv antibody library to systematically inactivate surface proteins expressed by human fibrosarcoma cells followed by a high-throughput assessment of transwell invasion. Results: Using this screen, we have identified CD155 (the poliovirus receptor) as a mediator of tumor cell invasion through its role in migration. Knockdown of CD155 by FALI or by RNAi resulted in a significant decrease in transwell migration of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells towards a serum chemoattractant. CD155 was found to be highly expressed in multiple cancer cell lines and primary tumors including glioblastoma (GBM). Knockdown of CD155 also decreased migration of U87MG GBM cells. CD155 is recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells where it colocalizes with actin and alphav-integrin, known mediators of motility and adhesion. Knockdown of CD155 also altered cellular morphology, resulting in cells that were larger and more elongated than controls when plated on a Matrigel substrate. Conclusion: These results implicate a role for CD155 in mediating tumor cell invasion and migration and suggest that CD155 may contribute to tumorigenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15471548
"""Novel animal glioma models that separately exhibit two different invasive and angiogenic phenotypes of human glioblastomas.""","""Objective: Invasive behaviors of malignant gliomas are fundamental traits and major reasons for treatment failure. Delineation of invasive growth is important in establishing treatment for gliomas and experimental neuro-oncology could benefit from an invasive glioma model. In this study, we established two new cell line-based animal models of invasive glioma. Methods: Two cell lines, J3T-1 and J3T-2, were derived from the same parental canine glioma cell line, J3T. These cells were inoculated to establish brain tumors in athymic mice and rats. Pathologic samples of these animal gliomas were examined to analyze invasive patterns in relation to angiogenesis, and were compared with human glioblastoma samples. The molecular profiles of these cell lines were also shown. Results: Histologically, J3T-1 and J3T-2 tumors exhibited different invasive patterns. J3T-1 cells clustered around newly developed vessels at tumor borders, whereas J3T-2 cells showed diffuse single cell infiltration into surrounding healthy parenchyma. In human malignant glioma samples, both types of invasion were observed concomitantly. Molecular profiles of these cell lines were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-9, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and platelet-derived growth factor were overexpressed in J3T-1 cells rather than in J3T-2 cells, whereas integrin Î±vÎ²3, matrix metalloproteinase-2, nestin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine were overexpressed in J3T-2 cells rather than in J3T-1 cells. Conclusions: These animal models histologically recapitulated two invasive and angiogenic phenotypes, namely angiogenesis-dependent and angiogenesis-independent invasion, also observed in human glioblastoma. These cell lines provided a reproducible in vitro and in vivo system to analyze the mechanisms of invasion and angiogenesis in glioma progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22120277
"""Pathway alterations during glioma progression revealed by reverse phase protein lysate arrays.""","""The progression of gliomas has been extensively studied at the genomic level using cDNA microarrays. However, systematic examinations at the protein translational and post-translational levels are far more limited. We constructed a glioma protein lysate array from 82 different primary glioma tissues, and surveyed the expression and phosphorylation of 46 different proteins involved in signaling pathways of cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell invasion. An analysis algorithm was employed to robustly estimate the protein expressions in these samples. When ranked by their discriminating power to separate 37 glioblastomas (high-grade gliomas) from 45 lower-grade gliomas, the following 12 proteins were identified as the most powerful discriminators: IBalpha, EGFRpTyr845, AKTpThr308, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), BadpSer136, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 2, IGFBP5, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB), Bcl-2, and c-Abl. Clustering analysis showed a close link between PI3K and AKTpThr308, IGFBP5 and IGFBP2, and IBalpha and EGFRpTyr845. Another cluster includes MMP9, Bcl-2, VEGF, and pRB. These clustering patterns may suggest functional relationships, which warrant further investigation. The marked association of phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308, but not Ser473, with glioblastoma suggests a specific event of PI3K pathway activation in glioma progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16619307
"""Glioma invasion in vitro is mediated by CD44-hyaluronan interactions.""","""Invasion is a clinically important problem contributing to mortality and morbidity in patients with gliomas, but the mechanism(s) by which glioma cells invade surrounding brain structures is poorly understood. Various experimental models have been used in attempts to elucidate the process of glioma invasion. An in vitro model which is increasingly being employed involves measurement of the rate of invasion of tumour cells through Matrigel-a complex mixture of extracellular matrix components derived from the Engelbroth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma. This model has been used to examine the possibility that extracellular hyaluronan (HA) might facilitate the invasive behaviour of human glioma cells. The major component of Matrigel is laminin, with smaller amounts of collagen IV, heparan sulphate proteoglycans, entactin, and nidogen but it lacks HA. In our experiments, we have incorporated HA into Matrigel and have measured its effect on the rate of invasion of human glioma cells in a modified Boyden chamber assay system. The incorporation of HA (50-800 mg/cm2) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in invasion. Invasion was enhanced by up to 70 per cent in comparison with HA-free Matrigel. Since CD44 is a major HA receptor expressed on gliomas, it might have a role in the HA-mediated facilitation of invasion. This was tested by blocking CD44 with specific antibody, which resulted in a 43 per cent reduction in invasion rate. We conclude that in an in vitro model system, HA enhances invasion of glioma cells and that the mechanism involves a CD44-HA interaction.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9196442
"""Proliferation and invasion: plasticity in tumor cells.""","""Invasive and proliferative phenotypes are fundamental components of malignant disease, yet basic questions persist about whether tumor cells can express both phenotypes simultaneously and, if so, what are their properties. Suitable in vitro models that allow characterization of cells that are purely invasive are limited because proliferation is required for cell maintenance. Here, we describe glioblastoma cells that are highly invasive in response to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). From this cell population, we selected subclones that were highly proliferative or displayed both invasive and proliferative phenotypes. The biological activities of invasion, migration, urokinase-type plasminogen activation, and branching morphogenesis exclusively partitioned with the highly invasive cells, whereas the highly proliferative subcloned cells uniquely displayed anchorage independent growth in soft agar and were highly tumorigenic as xenografts in immune-compromised mice. In response to HGF/SF, the highly invasive cells signal through the MAPK pathway, whereas the selection of the highly proliferative cells coselected for signaling through Myc. Moreover, in subcloned cells displaying both invasive and proliferative phenotypes, both signaling pathways are activated by HGF/SF. These results show how the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Myc pathways can cooperate to confer both invasive and proliferative phenotypes on tumor cells and provide a system for studying how transitions between invasion and proliferation can contribute to malignant progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16024725
"""Combined therapies of antithrombotics and antioxidants delay in silico brain tumour progression.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most frequent type of primary brain tumour, is a rapidly evolving and spatially heterogeneous high-grade astrocytoma that presents areas of necrosis, hypercellularity and microvascular hyperplasia. The aberrant vasculature leads to hypoxic areas and results in an increase in oxidative stress, selecting for more invasive tumour cell phenotypes. In our study, we assay in silico different therapeutic approaches which combine antithrombotics (ATs), antioxidants and standard radiotherapy (RT). To do so, we have developed a biocomputational model of GBM that incorporates the spatio-temporal interplay among two glioma cell phenotypes corresponding to oxygenated and hypoxic cells, a necrotic core and the local vasculature whose response evolves with tumour progression. Our numerical simulations predict that suitable combinations of ATs and antioxidants may diminish, in a synergistic way, oxidative stress and the subsequent hypoxic response. This novel therapeutical strategy, with potentially low or no toxicity, might reduce tumour invasion and further sensitize GBM to conventional RT or other cytotoxic agents, hopefully increasing median patient overall survival time.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24562299
"""Tumour control by whole brain irradiation of anti-VEGF-treated mice bearing intracerebral glioma.""","""Aim of the study: Tumour angiogenesis and invasion are key features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Angiogenesis inhibitors increase progression-free survival (PFS) of recurrent GBM patients. VEGF inhibition controls the bulk tumour growth by inhibition of angiogenesis, but does not inhibit the invasive tumour component. We investigated if invasive tumour growth can be controlled by combining anti-VEGF treatment with irradiation of tumour plus surrounding brain in an orthotopic murine model for GBM. Methods and materials: GBM cell line U251-NG2 was inoculated through a guide screw in the right frontal lobe of 53 athymic nude mice. Pegaptanib (a slow-releasing aptamer against VEGF) was injected in the tumour bed either or not followed by irradiation treatment with implanted I-125 seeds. Pegaptanib and/or irradiation were compared with sham-treated controls, resulting in four groups of 10-15 mice each. After 6 weeks of treatment, histological analysis was performed on all brains. Results: VEGF inhibition by locally deposited pegaptanib decreased tumour blood vessel density, and increased tumour hypoxia. Pegaptanib treatment still allowed the formation of tumour satellites. Irradiation decreased tumour size and suppressed formation of satellites. Combined pegaptanib plus irradiation further increased PFS. Tumour size directly correlated with PFS. Concluding statement: The anti-tumour effects of local VEGF inhibition are partially circumvented by the formation of invasive tumour satellites. Additional irradiation is effective in slowing down proliferation of these invasive tumour components.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19734041
"""Biodegradable interstitial release polymer loading a novel small molecule targeting Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and reducing brain tumour migration and invasion.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumour. The neoplasms are difficult to resect entirely because of their highly infiltration property and leading to the tumour edge is unclear. Gliadel wafer has been used as an intracerebral drug delivery system to eliminate the residual tumour. However, because of its local low concentration and short diffusion distance, patient survival improves non-significantly. Axl is an essential regulator in cancer metastasis and patient survival. In this study, we developed a controlled-release polyanhydride polymer loading a novel small molecule, n-butylidenephthalide (BP), which is not only increasing local drug concentration and extending its diffusion distance but also reducing tumour invasion, mediated by reducing Axl expression. First, we determined that BP inhibited the expression of Axl in a dose- and time-dependent manner and reduced the migratory and invasive capabilities of GBM cells. In addition, BP downregulated matrix metalloproteinase activity, which is involved in cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BP regulated Axl via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to epithelial cells in the invasive migratory mesenchymal cells that underlie cancer progression; we demonstrated that BP reduced the expression of EMT-related genes. Furthermore, we used the overexpression of Axl in GBM cells to prove that Axl is a crucial target in the inhibition of GBM EMT, migration and invasion. In an in vivo study, we demonstrated that BP inhibited tumour growth and suppressed Axl expression in a dose-dependent manner according to a subcutaneous tumour model. Most importantly, in an intracranial tumour model with BP wafer in situ treatment, we demonstrated that the BP wafer not only significantly increased the survival rate but also decreased Axl expression, and inhibited tumour invasion. These results contribute to the development of a BP wafer for a novel therapeutic strategy for treating GBM invasion and increasing survival in clinical subjects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26257061
"""Effect of changes in the CD44 gene on tumour cell invasion in gliomas.""","""Cell adhesion is a critical factor in the multistep process of tumour invasion. CD44 is one of the cell surface adhesion molecules responsible for interaction with hyaluronic acid, a component of the CNS extracellular matrix. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether alterations in the CD44 gene might account for different invasive behaviour. EcoRI restriction analysis by Southern blot hybridization revealed several additional hybridization signals in tissue specimens of two out of 16 patients with glioblastoma, indicating DNA rearrangements or point mutations, respectively, within the region of the CD44 gene. Expression patterns of CD44 isoforms in these two rearranged gliomas and in 28 other patients with malignant gliomas were analysed by RT-PCR. All cases displayed only the splice variant CD44H, which acts as hyaluronic acid receptor in glioma tumour cells. Tumour cell invasion was studied with Boyden chamber assays using hyaluronic acid as ligand and functional CD44H blocking antibody. Invasion of cells derived from those gliomas carrying the rearranged CD44 gene locus was decreased by about 50% compared with gliomas without rearrangement, indicating that the altered hybridization patterns in the two glioma samples influenced CD44H mediated glioma cell invasion through hyaluronic acid in vitro. Our results on CD44 isoform expression suggest that, in contrast to other solid tumours, gliomas seem to express only the CD44 variant. Genetic alterations within the CD44 gene might alter the binding domain of the receptor and thus account for different invasive behaviour in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9364462
"""Increased expression of podoplanin in malignant astrocytic tumors as a novel molecular marker of malignant progression.""","""Podoplanin (aggrus) is a mucin-like transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells. Podoplanin is putatively involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and malignant progression and may be involved in platelet aggregation. Previously, we showed upregulated expression of podoplanin in central nervous system (CNS) germinomas, but not in non-germinomatous germ cell tumors, except for parts of immature teratomas in limited numbers. However, little information exists about its role in CNS astrocytic tumors. In this study, 188 astrocytic tumors (30 diffuse astrocytomas, 43 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 115 glioblastomas) were investigated using immunohistochemistry with an anti-podoplanin antibody, YM-1. In 11 of 43 anaplastic astrocytomas (25.6%) and in 54 of 115 glioblastomas (47.0%), podoplanin was expressed on the surface of anaplastic astrocytoma cells and glioblastoma cells, especially around necrotic areas and proliferating endothelial cells. However, the surrounding brain parenchyma was not stained by YM-1. On the other hand, podoplanin expression was not observed in diffuse astrocytoma (0/30: 0%). Furthermore, we investigated the expression of podoplanin using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in 54 frozen astrocytic tumors (6 diffuse astrocytomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 34 glioblastomas). Podoplanin mRNA and protein expression were markedly higher in glioblastomas than in anaplastic astrocytomas.

"""Evaluation of radiation-related invasion in primary patient-derived glioma cells and validation with established cell lines: impact of different radiation qualities with differing LET.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and has a very poor overall prognosis. Multimodal treatment is still inefficient and one main reason is the invasive nature of GBM cells, enabling the tumor cells to escape from the treatment area causing tumor progression. This experimental study describes the effect of low- and high-LET irradiation on the invasion of primary GBM cells with a validation in established cell systems. Methods: Seven patient derived primary GBM as well as three established cell lines (LN229, LN18 and U87) were used in this study. Invasion was investigated using MatrigelÂ® coated transwell chambers. Irradiation was performed with low- (X-ray) and high-LET (alpha particles) radiation. The colony formation assay was chosen to determine the corresponding alpha particle dose equivalent to the X-ray dose. Results: 4 Gy X-ray irradiation increased the invasive potential of six patient derived GBM cells as well as two of the established lines. In contrast, alpha particle irradiation with an equivalent dose of 1.3 Gy did not show any effect on the invasive behavior. The findings were validated with established cell lines. Conclusion: Our results show that in contrast to low-LET irradiation high-LET irradiation does not enhance the invasion of established and primary glioblastoma cell lines. We therefore suggest that high-LET irradiation could become an alternative treatment option. To fully exploit the benefits of high-LET irradiation concerning the invasion of GBM further molecular studies should be performed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29882045
"""A distinct subset of glioma cell lines with stem cell-like properties reflects the transcriptional phenotype of glioblastomas and overexpresses CXCR4 as therapeutic target.""","""Glioblastomas contain stem-like cells that can be maintained in vitro using specific serum-free conditions. We investigated whether glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines preserve the expression phenotype of human glioblastomas more closely than conventional glioma cell lines. Expression profiling revealed that a distinct subset of GS lines, which displayed a full stem-like phenotype (GSf), mirrored the expression signature of glioblastomas more closely than either other GS lines or cell lines grown in serum. GSf lines are highly tumorigenic and invasive in vivo, express CD133, grow spherically in vitro, are multipotent and display a Proneural gene expression signature, thus recapitulating key functional and transcriptional aspects of human glioblastomas. In contrast, GS lines with a restricted stem-like phenotype exhibited expression signatures more similar to conventional cell lines than to original patient tumors, suggesting that the transcriptional resemblance between GS lines and tumors is associated with different degrees of 'stemness'. Among markers overexpressed in patient tumors and GSf lines, we identified CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target. GSf lines contained a minor population of CXCR4(hi) cells, a subfraction of which coexpressed CD133 and was expandable by hypoxia, whereas conventional cell lines contained only CXCR4(lo) cells. Convection-enhanced local treatment with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the highly invasive growth of GS xenografts in vivo and cell migration in vitro. We thus demonstrate the utility of GSf lines in testing therapeutic agents and validate CXCR4 as a target to block the growth of invasive tumor-initiating glioma stem cells in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21294158
"""Effect of human skin-derived stem cells on vessel architecture, tumor growth, and tumor invasion in brain tumor animal models.""","""Glioblastomas represent an important cause of cancer-related mortality with poor survival. Despite many advances, the mean survival time has not significantly improved in the last decades. New experimental approaches have shown tumor regression after the grafting of neural stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells into experimental intracranial gliomas of adult rodents. However, the cell source seems to be an important limitation for autologous transplantation in glioblastoma. In the present study, we evaluated the tumor targeting and antitumor activity of human skin-derived stem cells (hSDSCs) in human brain tumor models. The hSDSCs exhibit tumor targeting characteristics in vivo when injected into the controlateral hemisphere or into the tail vein of mice. When implanted directly into glioblastomas, hSDSCs distributed themselves extensively throughout the tumor mass, reduced tumor vessel density, and decreased angiogenic sprouts. In addition, transplanted hSDSCs differentiate into pericyte cell and release high amounts of human transforming growth factor-beta1 with low expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which may contribute to the decreased tumor cell invasion and number of tumor vessels. In long-term experiments, the hSDSCs were also able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to prolong animal survival. Similar behavior was seen when hSDSCs were implanted into two different tumor models, the chicken embryo experimental glioma model and the transgenic Tyrp1-Tag mice. Taken together, these data validate the use of hSDSCs for targeting human brain tumors. They may represent therapeutically effective cells for the treatment of intracranial tumors after autologous transplantation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17409412
"""Prognostic significance of growth kinetics in newly diagnosed glioblastomas revealed by combining serial imaging with a novel biomathematical model.""","""Glioblastomas are the most aggressive primary brain tumors, characterized by their rapid proliferation and diffuse infiltration of the brain tissue. Survival patterns in patients with glioblastoma have been associated with a number of clinicopathologic factors including age and neurologic status, yet a significant quantitative link to in vivo growth kinetics of each glioma has remained elusive. Exploiting a recently developed tool for quantifying glioma net proliferation and invasion rates in individual patients using routinely available magnetic resonance images (MRI), we propose to link these patient-specific kinetic rates of biological aggressiveness to prognostic significance. Using our biologically based mathematical model for glioma growth and invasion, examination of serial pretreatment MRIs of 32 glioblastoma patients allowed quantification of these rates for each patient's tumor. Survival analyses revealed that even when controlling for standard clinical parameters (e.g., age and Karnofsky performance status), these model-defined parameters quantifying biological aggressiveness (net proliferation and invasion rates) were significantly associated with prognosis. One hypothesis generated was that the ratio of the actual survival time after whatever therapies were used to the duration of survival predicted (by the model) without any therapy would provide a therapeutic response index (TRI) of the overall effectiveness of the therapies. The TRI may provide important information, not otherwise available, about the effectiveness of the treatments in individual patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that dynamic insight from routinely obtained pretreatment imaging may be quantitatively useful in characterizing the survival of individual patients with glioblastoma. Such a hybrid tool bridging mathematical modeling and clinical imaging may allow for stratifying patients for clinical studies relative to their pretreatment biological aggressiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19934335

Hypoxia, a hallmark of aggressive tumor behavior often noted in GBMs, has been associated with resistance to therapy, poorer survival, and more malignant tumor phenotypes. Based on the existence of a set of novel imaging techniques and modeling tools, our objective was to assess a hypothesized quantitative link between tumor growth kinetics [assessed via mathematical models and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and the hypoxic burden of the tumor [assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging]. Our biomathematical model for glioma kinetics describes the spatial and temporal evolution of a glioma in terms of concentration of malignant tumor cells. This model has already been proven useful as a novel tool to dynamically quantify the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D) of the glioma cells in individual patients. Estimates of these kinetic rates can be calculated from routinely available pretreatment MRI in vivo. Eleven adults with GBM were imaged preoperatively with (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET and serial gadolinium-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted MRIs to allow the estimation of patient-specific net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D). Hypoxic volumes were quantified from each FMISO-PET scan following standard techniques. To control for tumor size variability, two measures of hypoxic burden were considered: relative hypoxia (RH), defined as the ratio of the hypoxic volume to the T2-defined tumor volume, and the mean intensity on FMISO-PET scaled to the blood activity of the tracer (mean T/B). Pearson correlations between RH and the net rate of cell proliferation (rho) reached significance (P < 0.04).

RTVP-1 was expressed in high levels in glioblastomas, whereas its expression in low-grade astrocytomas and normal brains was very low. Transfection of glioma cells with small interfering RNAs targeting RTVP-1 decreased cell proliferation in all the cell lines examined and induced cell apoptosis in some of them. Overexpression of RTVP-1 increased astrocyte and glioma cell proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth of the cells. In addition, overexpression of RTVP-1 rendered glioma cells more resistant to the apoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and serum deprivation. To delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the survival effects of RTVP-1, we examined the expression and phosphorylation of various apoptosis-related proteins. We found that overexpression of RTVP-1 decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase and increased the expression of Bcl2 and that the protective effect of RTVP-1 was partially mediated by Bcl2. Finally, we found that RTVP-1 regulated the invasion of glioma cells as was evident by their enhanced migration through Matrigel and by their increased invasion in a spheroid confrontation assay. The increased invasive potential of the RTVP-1 overexpressors was also shown by the increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 in these cells. Our results suggest that the expression of RTVP-1 is correlated with the degree of malignancy of astrocytic tumors and that RTVP-1 is involved in the regulation of the growth, survival, and invasion of glioma cells.

On both univariate and multivariate analyses, cathepsin B and PAI-1 were strong predictors of overall survival among the group of glioblastomas (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.01, respectively). Immunohistochemical expression of cathepsin B further confirmed its prognostic value in an independent cohort of patients with glioblastoma. In situ hybridization showed that uPA is detected at the invasive edge of glioblastomas, whereas PAI-1 is more abundant in microvascular proliferation and pseudo-palisading cells than at the infiltrative edges.

"""High-grade glioma diffusive modeling using statistical tissue information and diffusion tensors extracted from atlases.""","""Glioma, especially glioblastoma, is a leading cause of brain cancer fatality involving highly invasive and neoplastic growth. Diffusive models of glioma growth use variations of the diffusion-reaction equation in order to simulate the invasive patterns of glioma cells by approximating the spatiotemporal change of glioma cell concentration. The most advanced diffusive models take into consideration the heterogeneous velocity of glioma in gray and white matter, by using two different discrete diffusion coefficients in these areas. Moreover, by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), they simulate the anisotropic migration of glioma cells, which is facilitated along white fibers, assuming diffusion tensors with different diffusion coefficients along each candidate direction of growth. Our study extends this concept by fully exploiting the proportions of white and gray matter extracted by normal brain atlases, rather than discretizing diffusion coefficients. Moreover, the proportions of white and gray matter, as well as the diffusion tensors, are extracted by the respective atlases; thus, no DTI processing is needed.

Clinical decisions and guidelines would be hence so more focused with such an advanced tool that could help clinicians and ensuring more accuracy and objectivity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26441424
"""Galectins are differentially expressed in supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas, astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, and significantly modulate tumor astrocyte migration.""","""Galectins, a family of mammalian lectins with specificity to beta-galactosides, are involved in growth-regulatory mechanisms and cell adhesion. A relationship is assumed to exist between the levels of expression of galectins and the level of malignancy in human gliomas. A comparative study of this aspect in the same series of clinical samples is required to prove this hypothesis. Using computer-assisted microscopy, we quantitatively characterized by immunohistochemistry the levels of expression of galectins-1, -3 and -8 in 116 human astrocytic tumors of grades I to IV. Extent of transcription of galectins-1, -3, and -8 genes was investigated in 8 human glioblastoma cell lines by means of RT-PCR techniques. Three of these cell lines were grafted into the brains of nude mice in order to characterize in vivo the galectins-1, -3 and -8 expression in relation to the patterns of the tumor invasion of the brain. The role of galectin-1, -3 and -8 in tumor astrocyte migration was quantitatively determined in vitro by means of computer-assisted phase-contrast videomicroscopy. The data indicate that the levels of galectin-1 and galectin-3 expression significantly change during the progression of malignancy in human astrocytic tumors, while that of galectin-8 remains unchanged. These three galectins are involved in tumor astrocyte invasion of the brain parenchyma since their levels of expression are higher in the invasive parts of xenografted glioblastomas than in their less invasive parts. Galectin-3, galectin-1, and to a lesser extent galectin-8, markedly stimulate glioblastoma cell migration in vitro. Since bands for the transcripts of human galectins-2, -4 and -9 were apparently less frequent and intense in the 8 human glioblastoma cell lines, this system provides an excellent model to assign defined roles to individual galectins and delineate overlapping and distinct functional aspects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11145198
"""Galectin-1 is highly expressed in human gliomas with relevance for modulation of invasion of tumor astrocytes into the brain parenchyma.""","""Protein (lectin)-carbohydrate interaction is supposed to be relevant for tumor cell behavior. The aims of the present work are to investigate whether galectin-1 modulates migration/invasion features in human gliomas in vitro, whether it can be detected in human gliomas immunohistochemically, and whether its expression is attributable to certain glioma subgroups with respect to invasion and prognosis. For this purpose, we quantitatively determined (by computer-assisted microscopy) the immunohistochemical expression of galectin-1 in 220 gliomas, including 151 astrocytic, 38 oligodendroglial, and 31 ependymal tumors obtained from surgical resection. We also xenografted three human glioblastoma cell lines (the H4, U87, and U373 models) into the brains of nude mice in order to characterize the in vivo galectin-1 expression pattern in relation to tumor invasion of the normal brain parenchyma. In addition, we characterized the role in vitro of galectin-1 in U373 tumor astrocyte migration and kinetics. Our data reveal expression of galectin-1 in all human glioma types with no striking differences between astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and ependymal tumors. The level of galectin-1 expression correlated with the grade in the group of astrocytic tumors only. Furthermore, immunopositivity of high-grade astrocytic tumors from patients with short-term survival periods was stronger than that of tumors from patients with long-term survivals. In human glioblastoma xenografts, galectin-1 was preferentially expressed in the more invasive parts of these xenografts. In vitro experiments revealed that galectin-1 stimulates migration of U373 astrocytes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11241742
"""Prognostic significance of tetraspanin CD151 in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Background: Tetraspanin CD151 is a positive effector of cancer invasion and metastasis. Methods: We investigated the expression of CD151 by immunohistochemistry in 211 cases of grade I to IV gliomas. Additionally, we performed O6-methylguanin-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation analysis using real-time methylation-specific PCR in 36 patients with glioblastoma, and the prognostic significance of these biomarkers in glioblastomas was evaluated. Results: Overexpression of CD151 was observed in a significant proportion (55.6%) of glioblastomas, while CD151 was rarely overexpressed in most of grade I to III glial tumors. CD151 overexpression was closely associated with MGMT methylation (P = 0.014), and it was a prognostic factor for predicting worse overall survival (OS; P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.043). We also found that combination of CD151 overexpression and MGMT methylation better stratified the patients' OS (P = 0.001) and PFS (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, CD151 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS over MGMT methylation (P = 0.012). Conclusions: CD151 seems to have a critical role for high-grade progression in astroglial tumors. Furthermore, CD151 is a good tissue marker that can be used easily in a daily practice for predicting worse prognosis in patients with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22926763
"""Molecular analysis of ex-vivo CD133+ GBM cells revealed a common invasive and angiogenic profile but different proliferative signatures among high grade gliomas.""","""Background: Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumours, and in this group glioblastomas (GBMs) are the higher-grade gliomas with fast progression and unfortunate prognosis. Two major aspects of glioma biology that contributes to its awful prognosis are the formation of new blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis and the invasion of glioma cells. Despite of advances, two-year survival for GBM patients with optimal therapy is less than 30%. Even in those patients with low-grade gliomas, that imply a moderately good prognosis, treatment is almost never curative. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a small fraction of glioma cells with characteristics of neural stem cells which are able to grow in vitro forming neurospheres and that can be isolated in vivo using surface markers such as CD133. The aim of this study was to define the molecular signature of GBM cells expressing CD133 in comparison with non expressing CD133 cells. This molecular classification could lead to the finding of new potential therapeutic targets for the rationale treatment of high grade GBM. Methods: Eight fresh, primary and non cultured GBMs were used in order to study the gene expression signatures from its CD133 positive and negative populations isolated by FACS-sorting. Dataset was generated with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 arrays and analysed using the software of the Affymetrix Expression Console. In addition, genomic analysis of these tumours was carried out by CGH arrays, FISH studies and MLPA; Results: Gene expression analysis of CD133+ vs. CD133- cell population from each tumour showed that CD133+ cells presented common characteristics in all glioblastoma samples (up-regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, permeability and down-regulation of genes implicated in cell assembly, neural cell organization and neurological disorders). Furthermore, unsupervised clustering of gene expression led us to distinguish between two groups of samples: those discriminated by tumour location and, the most importantly, the group discriminated by their proliferative potential; Conclusions: Primary glioblastomas could be sub-classified according to the properties of their CD133+ cells. The molecular characterization of these potential stem cell populations could be critical to find new therapeutic targets and to develop an effective therapy for these tumours with very dismal prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20735813
"""Glioma expansion in collagen I matrices: analyzing collagen concentration-dependent growth and motility patterns.""","""We study the growth and invasion of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in three-dimensional collagen I matrices of varying collagen concentration. Phase-contrast microscopy studies of the entire GBM system show that invasiveness at early times is limited by available collagen fibers. At early times, high collagen concentration correlates with more effective invasion. Conversely, high collagen concentration correlates with inhibition in the growth of the central portion of GBM, the multicellular tumor spheroid. Analysis of confocal reflectance images of the collagen matrices quantifies how the collagen matrices differ as a function of concentration. Studying invasion on the length scale of individual invading cells with a combination of confocal and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy reveals that the invasive GBM cells rely heavily on cell-matrix interactions during invasion and remodeling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15849239
"""Evaluation of Peritumoral Brain Parenchyma Using Contrast-Enhanced 3D Fast Imaging Employing Steady-State Acquisition at 3T for Differentiating Metastatic Brain Tumors and Glioblastomas.""","""Background: Metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas are the 2 of the most common brain neoplasms in adults. However, distinguishing solitary metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas on conventional magnetic resonance imaging remains particularly challenging. Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (CE-FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing between metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients with metastatic brain tumors and 14 patients with glioblastomas underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CE-FIESTA before surgery. First, 1 neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon classified the CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma by consensus. Next, the 2 neuroradiologists performed an observer performance study comparing tumor shape classification (smooth or irregular margins), a classic imaging finding, with the CE-FIESTA classification of the peritumoral brain parenchyma. Results: The CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma were classified as follows: type A, no hyperintense rim; type B, partial hyperintense rim; and type C, extended hyperintense rim. With regard to the diagnosis of metastatic brain tumors, the observer performance study demonstrated that the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of an extended hyperintense rim classification (type C) on CE-FIESTA images were 95.3%, 85.7%, and 93.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the CE-FIESTA classification was significantly higher than that of the tumor shape classification. Conclusions: CE-FIESTA images may provide useful information for distinguishing metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas, especially when focusing on differences in the peritumoral brain parenchyma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165229
"""Localization of CD44 at the invasive margin of glioblastomas by immunoelectron microscopy.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly invasive primary brain tumor, which is known to strongly express the CD44 cell adhesion receptor. A number of experimental studies suggest that the interaction of this receptor with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as hyaluronic acid may in part mediate human glioma cell adhesion and invasion of brain tissue. Although the expression of CD44 and its spliced variants in brain tumors have been extensively studied, there have been no reports localizing its expression to the invasive margin of the tumor. The authors used immunoelectron microscopy to investigate the expression patterns of CD44 in an in vitro organotypic invasion assay. Tumor spheroids initiated from the U373 MG human glioblastoma line were confronted with fetal rat brain aggregates in a spheroid coculture system. The CD44 expression appeared at the interface between glioblastoma tumor spheroids and brain tissue, as well as in the spheroid itself. CD44 immunoreactivity was not detectable in mature 21-day fetal brain aggregates. The findings provide direct evidence that CD44 is expressed at the confrontational invasive border between glioblastomas and brain tissue, further supporting its role in glioma cell-ECM recognition and attachment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9355234
"""Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) enhance three-dimensional (3D) growth of human glioblastomas.""","""Human glioblastomas (gliomas) are characterized as rapidly growing brain tumors which are highly invasive but rarely metastatic. Human gliomas synthesize and secrete increased levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) as well as expressing increased numbers of IGF receptors when compared to normal brain tissue. These observations suggest the existence of an IGF-mediated autocrine mechanism for glioma growth regulation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of human recombinant IGF (hrIGF) treatment on the in vitro growth of human glioma monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid cultures. The data demonstrate that hrIGF-I treatment of glioma cell lines slightly enhanced tumor monolayer proliferation as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. In contrast, treatment of glioma spheroids with hrIGF-I or hrDes(1-3)IGF-I, the truncated brain form of IGF-I, dramatically enhanced 3D tumor growth with a 1.5-2-fold reduction in spheroid doubling time (FRSDT). In addition, IGF-treated glioma spheroids were more densely packed than spheroids grown in media alone with no observed necrosis. These data suggest that IGFs will dramatically enhance glioma proliferation when 3D cell-cell contact occurs. This observed enhancement suggests that IGFs both synthesized in the brain and systemically support rapid proliferation of gliomas in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9097982
"""Velocity of radial expansion of contrast-enhancing gliomas and the effectiveness of radiotherapy in individual patients: a proof of principle.""","""Aims: The initial aims were to use recently available observations of glioblastomas (as part of a previous study) that had been imaged twice without intervening treatment before receiving radiotherapy in order to obtain quantitative measures of glioma growth and invasion according to a new bio-mathematical model. The results were so interesting as to raise the question whether the degree of radio-sensitivity of each tumour could be estimated by comparing the model-predicted and actual durations of survival and total numbers of glioma cells after radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging volumes were segmented and used to calculate the velocity of radial expansion (v) and the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion/dispersal (D) for each patient according to the bio-mathematical model. Results: The ranges of the values of v, D and rho show that glioblastomas, although clustering at the high end of rates, vary widely one from the other. The effects of X-ray therapy varied from patient to patient. About half survived as predicted without treatment, indicating radio-resistance of these tumours. The other half survived up to about twice as long as predicted without treatment and could have had a corresponding loss of glioma cells, indicating some degree of radio-sensitivity. These results approach the historical estimates that radiotherapy can double survival of the average patient with a glioblastoma. Conclusions: These cases are among the first for which values of v, D and rho have been calculated for glioblastomas. The results constitute a 'proof of principle' by combining our bio-mathematical model for glioma growth and invasion with pre-treatment imaging observations to provide a new tool showing that individual glioblastomas may be identified as having been radio-resistant or radio-sensitive.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18308523
"""Invasive behaviour of human gliomas is mediated by interindividually different integrin patterns.""","""Background: Glioma invasion is still a major obstacle for successful therapy. In the past we could demonstrate that glioma invasion is mediated by different adhesion molecules of the integrin family. Here we investigated whether a common pattern of integrin profiles might be involved, potentially providing a therapeutical avenue. Material and methods: Multicellular spheroids were generated out of three human cell lines (GaMG, U373, U251) and from tumor biopsies of 9 human glioblastomas. After confrontation with rat brain aggregates, functional blocking antibodies against different integrin subunits (alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha v, alpha 1, alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5) or four different disintegrines (kistrin, echistatin, eristostatin, flavoridin) were added. Integrin patterns of the human cell lines/specimens were determined by FACScan or immunohistochemistry. Results: In cell lines, antibodies against alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha v and alpha v beta 5 effectively reduced invasion into rat brain aggregates. Little effect could be observed with the anti-beta 1- or with anti-alpha v beta 3- antibodies. In primary tumor specimens, however, a different invasion pattern in regard to its integrin dependency emerged with antibodies against the alpha 3-chain or the alpha v beta 3 integrin being the most effective. Invasion of primary tumor tissue into the brain aggregates was by far more aggressive compared to that of the cell lines. Accordingly, it was less influenced by integrin antibodies. The disintegrines affected migration of glioma cells on purified ECM substrates in a heterogeneous matter, but had no impact on tumor invasion into brain aggregates. Conclusion: Although invasion of human gliomas is mediated by integrins, due to the heterogeneity of its dependency on different integrins this approach seems not to be appropriate to sufficiently alter glioma invasion in a therapeutical neuro-oncological setting.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9703915
"""Effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 on collagen synthesis, integrin expression, adhesion and invasion of glioma cells.""","""Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) as a potent modulator of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions may be related to poorly understood ECM-associated features of glioblastomas, such as diffuse brain invasion, rarity of extracranial metastasis and marked ECM production in vitro. We therefore studied TGF-beta 1 expression in glioblastoma biopsy specimens and cell lines by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cell lines were also examined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. To determine effects of TGF-beta 1, glioma cell lines U-138MG and U-373MG were incubated for 48 hours with TGF-beta 1 (0.1, 1, 10 ng/ml) or with antisense phosphorothioate-oligodeoxynucleotides (APO) designed to specifically inhibit TGF-beta 1 gene expression. Thereafter, collagen synthesis was determined by isotopic labeling with 3H-proline; integrin expression by flow cytometry; adhesion on collagen types I and IV, laminin and fibronectin by adhesion assays; and invasion through reconstituted basement membrane by invasion assays. We found that TGF-beta 1 was expressed by all glioma cell lines at protein and mRNA levels. Pretreatment with TGF-beta 1 increased the amount of collagen synthesis/cell, upregulated the alpha 5 integrin chain of U-138MG cells, and facilitated adhesion on all ECM substrates, while invasion of U-138MG cells, but not that of U-373MG cells, was markedly reduced. Conversely, pretreatment with APO reduced TGF-beta 1 protein expression levels, inhibited adhesion and increased invasion of U-138MG cells, but did not affect collagen synthesis. We conclude that exogenously applied TGF-beta 1 exerts marked effects on ECM-related features of glioma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7876891
"""Neural cell adhesion molecule isoform 140 declines with rise of WHO grade in human gliomas and serves as indicator for the invasion zone of multiform glioblastomas and brain metastases.""","""Purpose: Gliomas are highly invasive neuroepithelial tumors with a propensity of malignant transformation and very restricted treatment options. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) modulates cellular migration, proliferation, and synaptic plasticity by homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Hereby, we investigated its relevance as a glioma tissue marker for the biological aggressiveness of these tumors and compared these features with the carcinoma brain metastasis invasion zone. Materials and methods: We analyzed 194 human brain samples. Human tumor-free brain specimens served as control for the white and gray matter. In addition to that, we used human glioblastomas from nude rats. All tissues were investigated immunohistochemically for the expression of the NCAM isoform 140. Additionally, the multiplanar MRI-CT fusion neuronavigation-guided serial stereotactic biopsy was performed and completed by histopathological workup. Results: Human gliomas loose NCAM-140 with the rise of their WHO grade. Meningiomas are NCAM-140 negative. As the most striking feature, human brain metastases and the majority of human glioblastomas of our patients and of nude rats were totally NCAM-140 negative. This NCAM negativity led us to the conclusion of three different main glioblastoma invasion patterns. Surprisingly, the majority of brain metastasis samples that contained surrounding brain parenchyma demonstrated invasive tumor cell nests beyond the sharply demarcated metastasis border. We also found invasive metastatic cell nests outside the contrast enhancing tumor zone by means of the MRI-CT fusion neuronavigation-guided serial stereotactic biopsy. Conclusion: The expression of NCAM-140 inversely correlates with the WHO grade of human gliomas. The lost expression of NCAM-140 in human glioblastomas and in brain metastases enables the investigation of the brain-tumor interface and the definition of glioblastoma invasion patterns and shows that brain metastases are more invasive than ever thought.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20440511

Methods: RT-PCR, transfilter cell invasion assay, adhesion assay, scraping test, scrape loading, and dye transfer assay were used to determine the effect of LRRC4 on U251 cells. Results: SDF-1 alpha could increase the invasion in U251 which expressed CXCR4. The reintroduction of LRRC4 in U251 cells could inhibit the expression of CXCR4. LRRC4 also inhibited the adhesion ability of U251 to ECV304 as well as the mobility and invasion ability in vitro, which was mediated by the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis. Furthermore, LRRC4 could greatly enhance the gap junctional intercellular communication of U251 cells.

The cytokine TNF-alpha has been demonstrated to have anti-invasive properties in vitro. Materials and methods: The human glioblastoma cell line T98G was treated with controtrostatin or colloidal gold-TNF-alpha (CG-TNF-alpha) alone, or in combination. Vitronectin- and fibronectin-dependent adhesion of untreated and treated glioma cells was studied and compared. Invasion through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) was also examined. Results: Although both contortrostatin and CG-TNF-alpha inhibited invasion of T98G cells through Matrigel, the mechanism of inhibition appears to be different. Contortrostatin significantly decreased cell adhesion to vitronectin and fibronectin; CG-TNF-alpha did not. Contortrostatin binds to T98G integrins in an RGD-dependent manner, whereas protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be involved in CG-TNF-alpha actions, leading to inhibition of cell invasion. The efficiency of contortrostatin in inhibiting cell invasion was enhanced by combination with CG-TNF-alpha.

"""Four-dimensional analysis of human brain tumor spheroid invasion into fetal rat brain aggregates using confocal scanning laser microscopy.""","""The advent of confocal microscopy and fluorescence probes has made possible the routine visualization of the complex three-dimensional structures of thick fixed or live specimens. Four-dimensional (4-D) imaging of biological specimens (three-dimensional image reconstruction of the same living sample at different time points), remains a seldom-used application of confocal microscopy. In the present study we used 4-D imaging techniques to quantitate the invasion of human brain tumor spheroids into fetal rat brain aggregates (FRBAs), using the vital fluorescence membrane dyes, 3, 3'-Dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) as visualization probes. We found invasion patterns similar to the in vivo behavior of these tumors in the brain. Glioblastoma spheroids showed diffuse and circumscribed infiltration accompanied by cystic degeneration or necrosis of FRBAs. Spheroids from cerebral metastasis, however, showed a sharp delimitation of the invasive margin, and did not penetrate the FRBA beyond a depth of 55 microns. Measured rates of glioblastoma invasion varied with the tumor specimens examined. The slopes of the mid-portions of plots of % infiltration vs. time (hours) for four glioblastoma cell lines were 1.7 +/- 0.21 (SD), 0.67 +/- 0.11, 1.4 +/- 0.22 and 1.3 +/- 0.18.

"""Expression of CD 73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) in 165 glioblastomas by immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscopic histochemistry.""","""Background: CD 73 (5'-nucleotidase) is an ectoenzyme, which is expressed on normal and neoplastic glial plasma membranes. The enzyme binds to intracellular filamentous actin and the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin. CD 73 is a signalling pathway metabolite in the immune response of lymphocytes. The ectoenzyme catalyzes the conversion of purine and pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, GMP, IMP) and leads to elevation of the corresponding nucleosides (adenosine) in the extracellular space and might therefore modulate neuronal signalling and vascular perfusion. CD 73 has also been called a cellular motility factor. There is an increasing amount of evidence for the modulatory role of PKC-mediated CD 73 activity in ischemia, regeneration and repair, glioma cell proliferation and a possible invasion promoting feature of the ectoenzyme. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of CD 73 together with the labelling of PKC and EGFR. The latter is known as a marker for primary glioblastomas. Patients and methods: We investigated the expression of CD 73 in 165 glioblastoma specimens together with the expression patterns of PKC and EGFR by immunocytochemistry on cryosections with a 4-step grading evaluation by two independent observers. CD 73 was further investigated morphologically by electron-microscopic histochemistry in cell cultures of glioblastoma specimens. Results: With these methods it was possible to demonstrate a dense labelling pattern of glioblastoma specimens with anti-CD 73. 95.7% of the glioblastomas were identified with staining products, 63% with labelling grades 2 and 3. The dense staining of the endoplasmatic reticulum, vesicles, caveolar structures and glial membranes was demonstrated by electron-microscopic histochemistry. Some free enzymatic activity was located bound to the ECM components. We observed a significant coexpressions of CD 73 with PKC (p = 0.001) and CD 73 with EGFR (p = 0.022), which is a prospective marker for a high rate of early recurrency. Conclusions: The CD 73 activity was densely distributed on the membranes of glioblastoma cells in vivo and in cell cultures. The electron-microscopic histochemical studies could demonstrate enzymatic activity at the cell membranes and in vesicular structures and caveolae. Free staining deposits located on ECM components may result in a migration- and infiltration-promoting activity. The CD 73 expression could be correlated with the expression grades of PKC and EGFR. The latter has been identified as a prognostic factor which is expressed mainly on primary glioblastomas. PKC is a known tumour metabolite in several proliferation promoting pathways of EGF receptor signalling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10470109

Study design: Forty-nine patients with GBMs were selected, including 21 patients with high-grade gliomas and 28 patients with low-grade gliomas. ASL perfusion imaging was performed with GE Signa Excite HD 3.0 T MR scanning system (GE Healthcare). Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and relative tumor blood flow (rTBF) were quantified in all patients. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA version 12.0 software. Further, relevant human cohort studies published in Chinese and English languages were identified by database searches and screened. Data was extracted and meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2.0 software. Results: The ratios of rTBF to rCBF in the contralateral white matter, contralateral gray matter, and contralateral hemisphere of high-grade gliomas were higher than low-grade gliomas (all p < 0.05). ASL results in the solid tumors revealed that rCBF was greater in high-grade gliomas. Such differences in rCBF were not significant (p > 0.05) when 2 and 5 cm distances from tumor margin were compared. Importantly, rCBF values showed statistical differences when the 2 cm distance was compared with the 5 cm distance from tumor margin (all p < 0.05). Finally, meta-analysis results supported the conclusion that rCBF and rTBF values were significantly higher in high-grade GBM as compared to low-grade GBM. Conclusion: We present convincing data that ASL is highly effective in differentiating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, and thus is a useful tool for preoperative evaluation of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26860009

Thirty-seven astrocytic tumors (8 diffuse astrocytomas, 15 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 14 glioblastomas) and three gliomatosis cerebri were investigated immunohistochemically. The invasive glioma group included three cases of gliomatosis cerebri and two of glioblastoma associated with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was evaluated by assigning an immunohistochemical (IHC) score defined as the sum of expression frequency and intensity. mRNA expression patterns for the MMPs were also evaluated in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Neither the MMP-2 nor MMP-9 IHC score was related to histological malignancy. The MMP-2 IHC score of the invasive glioma group was significantly higher than those of other kinds of astrocytic tumors. However, the MMP-9 IHC score did not correlate with dissemination among astrocytic tumors. An inverse correlation was observed between the MIB-1 labeling index and the IHC scores of MMP-2, but it was not significant. A Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis revealed no significant relationship between the survival rate and MMP-2 or MMP-9 expression.

The highly induced genes included extracellular matrix components, metalloproteases, and a serine protease. We confirmed that mutant EGFR did make glioblastoma cells both more motile and invasive using in vitro assays. Furthermore, inhibitors of EGFR (OSI-774 and Tyrphostin AG1478) selectively down-regulated these molecular effectors in glioblastoma cells, eliminating enhanced invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12067969
"""Dynamics and pattern formation in invasive tumor growth.""","""We study the in vitro dynamics of the malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme. The growing tumor consists of a dense proliferating zone and an outer less dense invasive region. Experiments with different types of cells show qualitatively different behavior: one cell line invades in a spherically symmetric manner, but another gives rise to branches. We formulate a model for this sort of growth using two coupled reaction-diffusion equations for the cell and nutrient concentrations. When the ratio of the nutrient and cell diffusion coefficients exceeds some critical value, the plane propagating front becomes unstable with respect to transversal perturbations. The instability threshold and the full phase-plane diagram in the parameter space are determined. The results are in a qualitative agreement with experimental findings for the two types of cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16712401

A model of malignant glioma invasion into a gel matrix of collagen type I was used to characterize response to radiation treatment for four malignant glioma cell lines (C6, U251, U373, A172) and nine primary human glioblastoma explants. A radiation dose dependent inhibition of invasion was noted for the C6 astrocytoma cell line but not the other cell lines or explants. Addition of BCNU and dexamethasone to radiation produced additional inhibition of invasion among the cell lines and explants but could not suppress invasion entirely.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10720202
"""Gene therapeutic approaches to primary and metastatic brain tumors: II. ribozyme-mediated suppression of CD44 expression.""","""Glioblastomas are highly invasive intracerebral tumors that are known to express the CD44 cell adhesion molecule. Human glioma cell adhesion and invasion in vitro may in part be mediated by the interaction of CD44 with extracellular matrix proteins. To suppress the growth and invasive effects of CD44 expression on primary brain tumors we have designed two hammerhead ribozymes as potential gene therapeutic agents. Both ribozymes designed to target exon 2 of CD44 exhibited in vitro cleavage of in vitro transcribed CD44s and CD44R1 RNAs. The anti-CD44 effect of these ribozymes results from directed RNA cleavage, requiring both a target sequence and an appropriate catalytic center. Further, following transient transfection of one of these ribozymes into the SNB-19 glioma cell line, significant in vivo cleavage activity against cellular CD44 transcripts was demonstrated by flow cytometrical analysis. These preliminary results suggest that CD44-directed hammerhead ribozymes may be useful as gene therapeutic agents.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8750191
"""[Glioblastomas are resistant to apoptosis but less resistant to the autophagic process].""","""Malignant gliomas of which glioblastomas represent the ultimate grade of malignancy are characterized by dismal prognoses because malignant glioma cells present both important proliferation and neoangiogenesis processes and can actively migrate through the narrow extra-cellular spaces in the brain, often travelling relatively long distances, making them elusive targets for effective surgical management. Invasive malignant glioma cells show a decrease in their proliferation rates and a relative resistance to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) but seem less resistant to autophagic cell death (type II programmed cell death). Autophagic cell death represents an alternative mechanism to overcome, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of glioblastomas to pro-apoptotic-related therapies. Another way to potentially overcome apoptosis resistance is to decrease the migration of malignant glioma cells in the brain, which then should restore a level of sensitivity to pro-apoptotic drugs. We conclude this work with an algorithm showing the optimal current treatment for glioblastoma with the potent future innovations.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18405003
"""Intersectin1-s is involved in migration and invasion of human glioma cells.""","""Malignant gliomas have a tendency to invade diffusely into surrounding healthy brain tissues, thereby precluding their successful surgical removal. Intersectin1 (ITSN1) as a molecular linker in the central nervous system is well known as an important regulator of endocytosis and exocytosis. ITSN1 has two isoforms: ITSN1-l and ITSN1-s. In this study, we show that siRNA-mediated down regulation of ITSN1-s inhibited migration and invasion of glioma cells. In addition, we demonstrate the possible mechanisms by which ITSN1-s functions in migration and invasion. Several key proteins, including cofilin, LIMK, PAK, FAK, integrin Î²1, and MMP-9, which are critical for cells migration and invasion, were probably involved in ITSN1-s signaling pathways. These results suggest that ITSN1-s contributes to glioma cells migration and invasion by regulating the formation of cytoskeleton, influencing adhesion and increasing expression of MMP-9. Our results indicate that ITSN1-s is a critical factor in gliomas invasion and identify that ITSN1-s is a new potentially antiinvasion target for therapeutic intervention in gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21503949
"""Cell line with endogenous EGFRvIII expression is a suitable model for research and drug development purposes.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant brain tumor, characterized by high cellular heterogeneity. About 50% of glioblastomas are positive for EGFR amplification, half of which express accompanying EGFR mutation, encoding truncated and constitutively active receptor termed EGFRvIII. Currently, no cell models suitable for development of EGFRvIII-targeting drugs exist, while the available ones lack the intratumoral heterogeneity or extrachromosomal nature of EGFRvIII.The reports regarding the biology of EGFRvIII expressed in the stable cell lines are often contradictory in observations and conclusions. In the present study, we use DK-MG cell line carrying endogenous non-modified EGFRvIII amplicons and derive a sub-line that is near depleted of amplicons, whilst remaining identical on the chromosomal level. By direct comparison of the two lines, we demonstrate positive effects of EGFRvIII on cell invasiveness and populational growth as a result of elevated cell survival but not proliferation rate. Investigation of the PI3K/Akt indicated no differences between the lines, whilst NFÎºB pathway was over-active in the line strongly expressing EGFRvIII, finding further supported by the effects of NFÎºB pathway specific inhibitors. Taken together, these results confirm the important role of EGFRvIII in intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of tumor behavior.

"""Spatiotemporal modeling reveals high-resolution invasion states in glioblastoma.""","""Background: Diffuse invasion of glioblastoma cells through normal brain tissue is a key contributor to tumor aggressiveness, resistance to conventional therapies, and dismal prognosis in patients. A deeper understanding of how components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to overall tumor organization and to programs of invasion may reveal opportunities for improved therapeutic strategies. Results: Towards this goal, we apply a novel computational workflow to a spatiotemporally profiled GBM xenograft cohort, leveraging the ability to distinguish human tumor from mouse TME to overcome previous limitations in the analysis of diffuse invasion. Our analytic approach, based on unsupervised deconvolution, performs reference-free discovery of cell types and cell activities within the complete GBM ecosystem. We present a comprehensive catalogue of 15 tumor cell programs set within the spatiotemporal context of 90 mouse brain and TME cell types, cell activities, and anatomic structures. Distinct tumor programs related to invasion align with routes of perivascular, white matter, and parenchymal invasion. Furthermore, sub-modules of genes serving as program network hubs are highly prognostic in GBM patients. Conclusion: The compendium of programs presented here provides a basis for rational targeting of tumor and/or TME components.

The goal of this research was to determine how the ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit (RRM2) influenced proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of human glioblastoma cells. The level of proliferation of human glioblastoma cells was measured through CCK8, colony formation assay and immunofluorescence stains. Flow cytometry (FCM), wound healing, and transwell assays were conducted to detect cell apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Apoptotic level of cells and invasion-related expression of protein were measured by Western blot. Xenograft tumor model was established to confirm effect of RRM2 on the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells in vivo. Silencing RRM2 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of glioblastoma cells whereas enhanced apoptosis rate. Overexpressing RRM2 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion but suppressed apoptosis. In vivo, Overexpressing RRM2 accelerated the tumor growth in glioblastoma cells.

Expression levels of miR-590-3p in 15 GBM specimens with adjacent tissues and five GBM cell lines were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR.

"""miR-124a is frequently down-regulated in glioblastoma and is involved in migration and invasion.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) represents a formidable clinical challenge for both patients and treating physicians. Due to better local treatments and prolonged patient survival, remote recurrences are increasingly observed, underpinning the importance of targeting tumour migration and attachment. Aberrant expression of microRNA (miRNA) is commonly associated with cancer and loss of miR-124a has previously been implicated to function as a tumour suppressor. The assessment of miR-124a in clinical specimens has been limited and a potential role in migration and invasion has been unexplored until now. We measured the expression levels of mature miR-124a in a retrospective series of 119 cases of histologically confirmed GBM and found its expression was markedly lower in over 80% of the GBM clinical specimens compared to normal brain tissue. The level of reduction in the clinical cohort varied significantly and patients with lower than the average miR-124a expression levels displayed shorter survival times. Endogenous miR-124a expression and the protein expression of three of its targets; IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), laminin Î³1 (LAMC1) and integrin Î²1 (ITGB1) were significantly reciprocally associated in the majority of the clinical cases. We confirmed this association in our in vitro model. Functionally, the ectopic expression of mature miR-124a in a GBM cell line resulted in significant inhibition of migration and invasion, demonstrating a role for miR-124a in promoting tumour invasiveness.

"""Regulation of glioblastoma cell invasion by PKC iota and RhoB.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor and remains largely incurable, in large part, due to its highly invasive nature. The phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase pathway is often constitutively active in these tumors due to activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor, or deletion/loss of function of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Protein kinase C type iota (PKC iota), a member of the atypical protein kinase C family, is activated by the PI 3-kinase pathway and is an important downstream mediator. Here, we have assessed the role of PKC iota in glioblastoma cell invasion. Depletion of PKC iota with RNA interference caused an increase in actin stress fibers and a decrease in cell motility and invasion. Gene expression microarray analysis of U87MG cells showed that PKC iota repressed expression of mRNA for RhoB, which has previously been shown to have a role in actin stress fiber formation. Western blot analysis showed that both PKC iota depletion and pharmacological inhibition of PKC iota caused an increase in the protein levels of RhoB, as did inhibition of PI 3-kinase. Expression of RhoB from a constitutive promoter caused changes in actin stress fibers and cell invasion that were similar to those seen with PKC iota depletion. These data show that PKC iota, activated as a consequence of aberrant upstream PI 3-kinase signaling, mediates glioblastoma cell motility and invasion, and that repression of RhoB is key downstream event in PKC iota signaling leading to enhanced cell motility. In addition, constitutive expression of RhoB repressed PKC iota activity, as assessed by its phosphorylation status on Thr555. PKC iota and RhoB are, therefore, mutually antagonistic, potentially creating a sensitive switch between invasive and non-invasive phenotypes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18212741
"""The small GTPase RhoG mediates glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Background: The invasion of glioblastoma cells into regions of the normal brain is a critical factor that limits current therapies for malignant astrocytomas. Previous work has identified roles for the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factors Trio and Vav3 in glioblastoma invasion. Both Trio and Vav3 act on the small GTPase RhoG. We therefore examined the role of RhoG in the invasive behavior of glioblastoma cells. Results: We found that siRNA-mediated depletion of RhoG strongly inhibits invasion of glioblastoma cells through brain slices ex vivo. In addition, depletion of RhoG has a marginal effect on glioblastoma cell proliferation, but significantly inhibits glioblastoma cell survival in colony formation assays. We also observed that RhoG is activated by both HGF and EGF, two factors that are thought to be clinically relevant drivers of glioblastoma invasive behavior, and that RhoG is overexpressed in human glioblastoma tumors versus non-neoplastic brain. In search of a mechanism for the contribution of RhoG to the malignant behavior of glioblastoma cells, we found that depletion of RhoG strongly inhibits activation of the Rac1 GTPase by both HGF and EGF. In line with this observation, we also show that RhoG contributes to the formation of lamellipodia and invadopodia, two functions that have been shown to be Rac1-dependent. Conclusions: Our functional analysis of RhoG in the context of glioblastoma revealed a critical role for RhoG in tumor cell invasion and survival.

"""PHIP drives glioblastoma motility and invasion by regulating the focal adhesion complex.""","""The invasive behavior of glioblastoma is essential to its aggressive potential. Here, we show that pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein (PHIP), acting through effects on the force transduction layer of the focal adhesion complex, drives glioblastoma motility and invasion. Immunofluorescence analysis localized PHIP to the leading edge of glioblastoma cells, together with several focal adhesion proteins: vinculin (VCL), talin 1 (TLN1), integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), as well as phosphorylated forms of paxillin (pPXN) and focal adhesion kinase (pFAK). Confocal microscopy specifically localized PHIP to the force transduction layer, together with TLN1 and VCL. Immunoprecipitation revealed a physical interaction between PHIP and VCL. Targeted suppression of PHIP resulted in significant down-regulation of these focal adhesion proteins, along with zyxin (ZYX), and produced profoundly disorganized stress fibers. Live-cell imaging of glioblastoma cells overexpressing a ZYX-GFP construct demonstrated a role for PHIP in regulating focal adhesion dynamics. PHIP silencing significantly suppressed the migratory and invasive capacity of glioblastoma cells, partially restored following TLN1 or ZYX cDNA overexpression. PHIP knockdown produced substantial suppression of tumor growth upon intracranial implantation, as well as significantly reduced microvessel density and secreted VEGF levels. PHIP copy number was elevated in the classical glioblastoma subtype and correlated with elevated EGFR levels. These results demonstrate PHIP's role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion dynamics, and tumor cell motility, and identify PHIP as a key driver of glioblastoma migration and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32273388
"""Human glioblastomas overexpress ADAMTS-5 that degrades brevican.""","""Selective cleavage of the Glu395-Ser396 bond of brevican, one of the major proteoglycans in adult brain tissues, is thought to be important for glioma cell invasion. Our previous biochemical study demonstrated that ADAMTS-4, a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, has such an activity. In the present study, we examined brevican-degrading activities of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 at the cellular level, and their expression and localization in human glioma tissues. In 293T transfectants expressing ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5, brevican was cleaved into two major fragments in an identical pattern, but no such degradation was observed with ADAMTS-1 transfectants. When the expression levels of these ADAMTS species were examined by real-time quantitative PCR, only ADAMTS-5 was found to be overexpressed in glioblastoma tissues compared to control normal brain tissues (P <0.05). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ADAMTS-5 is expressed predominantly in glioblastoma cells. Forced expression of ADAMTS-5 in glioma cell lines stimulated cell invasion. These results demonstrate for the first time that ADAMTS-5 is capable of degrading brevican and is overexpressed in glioblastoma cells, and suggest that ADAMTS-5 may play a role in glioma cell invasion through the cleavage of brevican.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16133547

"""Cannabinoid Signaling in Glioma Cells.""","""Cannabinoids are a group of structurally heterogeneous but pharmacologically related compounds, including plant-derived cannabinoids, synthetic substances and endogenous cannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Cannabinoids elicit a wide range of central and peripheral effects mostly mediated through cannabinoid receptors. There are two types of specific Gi/o-protein-coupled receptors cloned so far, called CB1 and CB2, although an existence of additional cannabinoid-binding receptors has been suggested. CB1 and CB2 differ in their predicted amino acid sequence, tissue distribution, physiological role and signaling mechanisms. Significant alterations of a balance in the cannabinoid system between the levels of endogenous ligands and their receptors occur during malignant transformation in various types of cancer, including gliomas. Cannabinoids exert anti-proliferative action in tumor cells. Induction of cell death by cannabinoid treatment relies on the generation of a pro-apoptotic sphingolipid ceramide and disruption of signaling pathways crucial for regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. Increased ceramide levels lead also to ER-stress and autophagy in drug-treated glioblastoma cells. Beyond blocking of tumor cells proliferation cannabinoids inhibit invasiveness, angiogenesis and the stem cell-like properties of glioma cells, showing profound activity in the complex tumor microenvironment.

Experimental design: Glioma stem cell (GSC) NSC11 and U87 cell lines with acquired resistance to bevacizumab were developed from orthotopic xenografts in nude mice treated with bevacizumab. Genome-wide analyses were used to identify changes in tumor subtype and specific factors associated with resistance. Results: Mice with established parental NSC11 and U87 cells responded to bevacizumab, whereas glioma cell lines derived at the time of acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy were resistant to bevacizumab and did not have prolongation of survival compared with untreated controls. Gene expression profiling comparing anti-VEGF therapy-resistant cell lines to untreated controls showed an increase in genes associated with a mesenchymal origin, cellular migration/invasion, and inflammation. Gene-set enrichment analysis showed that bevacizumab-treated tumors showed a highly significant correlation to published mesenchymal gene signatures. Mice bearing resistant tumors showed significantly greater infiltration of myeloid cells in NSC11- and U87-resistant tumors.

It has been associated with tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Glioma progression is characterized by increased invasiveness and neovascularization, so we hypothesized that expression of Ets-1 proto-oncogene might play a role in the progression of these tumors. Therefore, we examined the expression of Ets-1 protein by immunohistochemical means and in situ hybridization in tissues obtained from 81 primary and 20 recurrent astrocytic tumors. Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 glioblastomas (Grade IV astrocytomas) stained for Ets-1. The percentage of positive cells in glioblastomas varied from 10 to 90%. Of the 16 anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade III), 4 (25%) were moderately positive (<50% of cells) for Ets-1. None of 22 cases of low-grade astrocytomas (Grade II) expressed endogenous Ets-1. The staining score was significantly associated with tumor grade (P < .0001). Normal brain tissues did not express Ets-1 protein, whereas recurrent astrocytoma cases expressed significantly more positivity for Ets-1 than did primary tumors (P = .03). The Ets-1 protein was observed mainly in the nucleus and corresponded to the cytoplasmic Ets-1 mRNA localization by in situ hybridization.

Recent research on cancer stroma indicates that the brain microenvironment plays a substantial role in tumor malignancy and treatment responses to current antitumor therapy. In this work, we have investigated the effect of alterations in brain tumor extracellular matrix tenascin-C (TNC) on brain tumor growth patterns including proliferation and invasion. Methods: Since intracranial xenografts from patient-derived GBM neurospheres form highly invasive tumors that recapitulate the invasive features demonstrated in human patients diagnosed with GBM, we studied TNC gain-of-function and loss-of function in these GBM neurospheres in vitro and in vivo. Results: TNC loss-of-function promoted GBM neurosphere cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton organization. Yet, TNC loss-of-function or exogenous TNC had no effect on GBM neurosphere cell growth in vitro. In animal models, decreased TNC in the tumor microenvironment was accompanied by decreased tumor invasion and increased tumor proliferation, suggesting that TNC regulates the 'go-or-grow' phenotypic switch of glioma in vivo. We demonstrated that decreased TNC in the tumor microenvironment modulated behaviors of stromal cells including endothelial cells and microglia, resulting in enlarged tumor blood vessels and activated microglia in tumors. We further demonstrated that tumor cells with decreased TNC expression are sensitive to anti-proliferative treatment in vitro. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that detailed understanding of how TNC in the tumor microenvironment influences tumor behavior and the interactions between tumor cells and surrounding nontumor cells will benefit novel combinatory antitumor strategies to treat malignant brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26320116

The model shows how variations in glucose availability significantly affect the activity of signalling molecules and, in turn, lead to critical cell migration.

Baseline multicentric tumors (OR = 4.07; P = 0.042) and distant recurrence (OR = 28.5; P < 0.001) were two significant predictors of 3-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Distant recurrence (HR = 3.94; P < 0.001) was the only independent predictor of PFS.

"""Extracellular Vesicles in Glioblastoma: Role in Biological Processes and in Therapeutic Applications.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant form of primary brain cancer; it is characterized by one of the highest mortality among human cancers. Maximal and aggressive surgical resection is the first approach treatment even if not usually definitive, being the tumor characterized by a high proliferative rate and extensive invasion. Early diagnosis, associated to careful monitoring, is pivotal in glioblastoma treatment; Magnetic Resonance Imaging is used for monitoring purpose, but it's not sensitive enough to detect very small tumors; a valid alternative could be a repeated biopsy, but it is associated to a significant morbidity: less invasive options for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring are unfailingly researched. Methods: A careful search was performed on PubMed, mainly considering papers in the last 10 years. Conclusion: In recent years it has begun to take hold the knowledge that glioblastoma cells secrete extracellular vesicles (microvesicles and exosomes), which mirror the molecular features of parental cells and are able to escape from tumor microenvironment, reaching cerebrospinal fluid and systemic blood circulation. Such information led to consider the possibility to use extracellular vesicles in biological fluids as markers of glioblastoma pathology and to use them as a more feasible 'liquid-biopsy' to gain diagnostic information, follow the disease progression and the response to clinical treatment, just through a blood test or cerebrospinal fluid collection. The most interesting extracellular vesiclesassociated molecules studied as glioblastoma markers are taken into account, as well as approaches aiming to use extracellular vesicles as cell-free vaccines or vehicle of therapeutic molecules.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27528364
"""The Role of Fibroblast Activation Protein in Glioblastoma and Gliosarcoma: A Comparison of Tissue, (68)Ga-FAPI-46 PET Data, and Survival Data.""","""Despite their unique histologic features, gliosarcomas belong to the group of glioblastomas and are treated according to the same standards. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a component of a tumor-specific subpopulation of fibroblasts that plays a critical role in tumor growth and invasion. Some case studies suggest an elevated expression of FAP in glioblastoma and a particularly strong expression in gliosarcoma attributed to traits of predominant mesenchymal differentiation. However, the prognostic impact of FAP and its diagnostic and therapeutic potential remain unclear. Here, we investigate the clinical relevance of FAP expression in gliosarcoma and glioblastoma and how it correlates with 68Ga-FAP inhibitor (FAPI)-46 PET uptake. Methods: Patients diagnosed with gliosarcoma or glioblastoma without sarcomatous differentiation with an overall survival of less than 2.5 y were enrolled. Histologic examination included immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative scoring of FAP (0-3, with higher values indicating stronger expression). Additionally, 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET scans were performed in a subset of glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation patients. The clinical SUVs were correlated with FAP expression levels in surgically derived tumor tissue and relevant prognostic factors. Results: Of the 61 patients who were enrolled, 13 of them had gliosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more FAP in gliosarcomas than in glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation of tumor tissue (P < 0.0001). In the latter, FAP expression was confined to the perivascular space, whereas neoplastic cells additionally expressed FAP in gliosarcoma. A significant correlation of immunohistochemical FAP with SUVmean and SUVpeak of 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET indicates that clinical tracer uptake represents FAP expression of the tumor. Although gliosarcomas express higher levels of FAP than do glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation, overall survival does not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion: The analysis reveals a significant correlation between SUVmean and SUVpeak in 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET and immunohistochemical FAP expression. This study indicates that FAP expression is much more abundant in the gliosarcoma subgroup of glioblastomas. This could open not only a diagnostic but also a therapeutic gap, since FAP could be explored as a theranostic target to enhance survival in a distinct subgroup of high-risk brain tumor patients with poor survival prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960714
"""Toward patient-specific, biologically optimized radiation therapy plans for the treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: To demonstrate a method of generating patient-specific, biologically-guided radiotherapy dose plans and compare them to the standard-of-care protocol. Methods and materials: We integrated a patient-specific biomathematical model of glioma proliferation, invasion and radiotherapy with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for intensity-modulated radiation therapy optimization to construct individualized, biologically-guided plans for 11 glioblastoma patients. Patient-individualized, spherically-symmetric simulations of the standard-of-care and optimized plans were compared in terms of several biological metrics. Results: The integrated model generated spatially non-uniform doses that, when compared to the standard-of-care protocol, resulted in a 67% to 93% decrease in equivalent uniform dose to normal tissue, while the therapeutic ratio, the ratio of tumor equivalent uniform dose to that of normal tissue, increased between 50% to 265%. Applying a novel metric of treatment response (Days Gained) to the patient-individualized simulation results predicted that the optimized plans would have a significant impact on delaying tumor progression, with increases from 21% to 105% for 9 of 11 patients. Conclusions: Patient-individualized simulations using the combination of a biomathematical model with an optimization algorithm for radiation therapy generated biologically-guided doses that decreased normal tissue EUD and increased therapeutic ratio with the potential to improve survival outcomes for treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24265748
"""Glioma stem cell maintenance: the role of the microenvironment.""","""Glioblastomas are highly lethal cancers for which conventional therapies provide only palliation. The cellular heterogeneity of glioblastomas is manifest in genetic and epigenetic variation with both stochastic and hierarchical models informing cellular phenotypes. At the apex of the hierarchy is a self-renewing, tumorigenic, cancer stem cell (CSC). The significance of CSCs is underscored by their resistance to cytotoxic therapies, invasive potential, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, targeting CSCs may offer therapeutic benefit and sensitize tumors to conventional treatment, demanding elucidation of CSC regulation. Attention has been paid to intrinsic cellular systems in CSCs, but recognition of extrinsic factors is evolving. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are enriched in functional niches--prominently the perivascular space and hypoxic regions. These niches provide instructive cues to maintain GSCs and induce cellular plasticity towards a stem-like phenotype. GSC-maintaining niches may therefore offer novel therapeutic targets but also signal additional complexity with perhaps different pools of GSCs governed by different molecular mechanisms that must be targeted for tumor control.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21827414

The purpose of our study was to investigate the pathological and clinical significance of Olig2 and YKL40 immunoexpression in 152 GBs in relationship to the SVZ II and III. Olig2 expressions were successfully detected in 12 (15.58%) of 77 SVZ type II GBs and 16 (21.3%) of 75 SVZ type III GBs, respectively.

In the absence of curative chemotherapy this invasion, beyond surgical and radiotherapy margins, to distant brain sites is thought to be an important cause of treatment failure. Paradoxically, studies analyzing failure patterns have consistently shown that the large majority of failures occur at the original tumor site. This conflict may be explained by the fact these cancers are often only sub-totally resected and radiotherapy and chemotherapies fail to control this significant local cancer burden. We analyzed the failure pattern in 20 consecutive patients with complete resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portion of GBM demonstrated on the immediate post-operative magnetic resonance study, and who underwent a radical course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We found that recurrences occurred only at the resection margin in 17 of 20 patients. Recurrences were exclusively distant in 2 of 20 patients and occurred at both the resection margin and a distant site in 1 of 20 cases.

Here, we propose that diverse types of solid tumors share common physical motifs that change in time and space, serving as universal regulators of malignancy. We use breast cancer and glioblastoma as instructive examples and highlight how invasion in both diseases is driven by the appropriation of structural guidance cues, contact-dependent heterotypic interactions with stromal cells, and elevated interstitial fluid pressure and flow.

"""Hypoxia and the malignant glioma microenvironment: regulation and implications for therapy.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) tumors are the most common type of brain tumors. These tumors are in general very malignant and can be characterized as rapidly progressive astrocytomas. The pathological characteristics of these tumors are exemplified by an active invasiveness, necrosis and a specialized form of angiogenesis, known as microvascular hyperplasia. These pathological features are thought to be due to tissue hypoxia. Cells that are under hypoxic stress can either develop an adaptive response that includes increasing the rate of glycolysis and angiogenesis or undergo cell death by promoting apoptosis and/or necrosis. The ability of tumor cells to maintain a balance between an adaptation to hypoxia and cell death is regulated by a family of transcription factors called hypoxia-inducing factors (HIF), which are essential for the regulation of the expression of a large number of hypoxia-responsive genes. The hypothesis that tumor hypoxia would facilitate the likelihood of metastases, tumor recurrence, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the invasive potential; all of which culminate in a decrease in patient survival.

"""The Cytoskeletal Adapter Protein Spinophilin Regulates Invadopodia Dynamics and Tumor Cell Invasion in Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a primary brain cancer that is resistant to all treatment modalities. This resistance is due, in large part, to invasive cancer cells that disperse from the main tumor site, escape surgical resection, and contribute to recurrent secondary lesions. The adhesion and signaling mechanisms that drive glioblastoma cell invasion remain enigmatic, and as a result there are no effective anti-invasive clinical therapies. Here we have characterized a novel adhesion and signaling pathway comprised of the integrin Î±vÎ²8 and its intracellular binding partner, Spinophilin (Spn), which regulates glioblastoma cell invasion in the brain microenvironment. We show for the first time that Spn binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of Î²8 integrin in glioblastoma cells. Genetically targeting Spn leads to enhanced invasive cell growth in preclinical models of glioblastoma. Spn regulates glioblastoma cell invasion by modulating the formation and dissolution of invadopodia. Spn-regulated invadopodia dynamics are dependent, in part, on proper spatiotemporal activation of the Rac1 GTPase. Glioblastoma cells that lack Spn showed diminished Rac1 activities, increased numbers of invadopodia, and enhanced extracellular matrix degradation. Collectively, these data identify Spn as a critical adhesion and signaling protein that is essential for modulating glioblastoma cell invasion in the brain microenvironment. Implications: Tumor cell invasion is a major clinical obstacle in glioblastoma and this study identifies a new signaling pathway regulated by Spinophilin in invasive glioblastoma.

"""MicroRNA-30c delivered by bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells induced apoptosis and diminished cell invasion in U-251 glioblastoma cell line.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most belligerent and prevalent brain malignancy among adults. Due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), drug administration is confronted by massive challenges, making resectional surgery the only treatment pipeline. MicroRNAs have recently absorbed the attention of studies for correlating with the progression of various malignancies. miR-30c has been reported to play a role in cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis process. For instance, miR-30c has been reported to regulate apoptosis through the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). miR-30c also targets IL-6, which further induces apoptosis. Besides, miR-30c inhibits glioma proliferation and its migratory ability. Besides, the overexpression of miR-30c arrested cells at G0 as well as dampening their migration and invasion. However, it has been shown that the expression level of miR-30c was low in glioma. MSCs can migrate toward tumor cells which is called tumor-tropism, in which they are capable of delivering engineered miR-30c based on gap junction and non-intimacy mechanisms. Material and methods: MiR-30c was cloned into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP vector utilizing XbaI and EcoRI in order to construct pCDH-miR-30c. Then psPAX2, pMD2.G, and pCDH-miR-30c were co-transfected into Hek-293T to yield lenti-miR-30c virus particles. Next, bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were Transduced with lenti-miR-30c.

"""LncRNA SAMMSON Knockdown Inhibits the Malignancy of Glioblastoma Cells by Inactivation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway.""","""Dysregulated lncRNAs are proposed to be tightly associated with the progression of various tumors including glioblastoma (GBM). LncRNA Survival Associated Mitochondrial Melanoma-Specific Oncogenic Non-Coding RNA (SAMMSON) has been reported to be an oncogenic lncRNA in several tumors. Nevertheless, the specific role and molecular mechanism of SAMMSON in GBM progression remain unknown. Expression of SAMMSON in GBM tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR. CCK-8 and LDH release assays were applied to evaluate cellular viability. Invasion effect was assessed by Transwell invasion assay and western blot analysis of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression. Apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry analysis and caspase-3 activity assay. The protein levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, protein kinase B (Akt) and p-Akt were estimated by western blot. We found that SAMMSON was highly expressed in GBM tissues and cells. SAMMSON knockdown suppressed cell viability and increased LDH release in GBM cells. Moreover, SAMMSON silencing impeded the invasive ability of GBM cells by regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, SAMMSON downregulation increased the apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity in GBM cells. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway was inhibited following SAMMSON silencing in GBM cells. Rescue assays revealed that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by 740Y-P abolished SAMMSON knockdown-induced viability reduction, invasion suppression and apoptosis in GBM cells.

"""Identification of RNA-Binding Protein LARP4B as a Tumor Suppressor in Glioma.""","""Transposon-based insertional mutagenesis is a valuable method for conducting unbiased forward genetic screens to identify cancer genes in mice. We used this system to elucidate factors involved in the malignant transformation of neural stem cells into glioma-initiating cells. We identified an RNA-binding protein, La-related protein 4b (LARP4B), as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in glioma. LARP4B expression was consistently decreased in human glioma stem cells and cell lines compared with normal neural stem cells. Moreover, heterozygous deletion of LARP4B was detected in nearly 80% of glioblastomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. LARP4B loss was also associated with low expression and poor patient survival. Overexpression of LARP4B in glioma cell lines strongly inhibited proliferation by inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis in four of six lines as well as in two patient-derived glioma stem cell populations. The expression levels of CDKN1A and BAX were also upregulated upon LARP4B overexpression, and the growth-inhibitory effects were partially dependent on p53 (TP53) activity in cells expressing wild-type, but not mutant, p53. We further found that the La module, which is responsible for the RNA chaperone activity of LARP4B, was important for the growth-suppressive effect and was associated with BAX mRNA. Finally, LARP4B depletion in p53 and Nf1-deficient mouse primary astrocytes promoted cell proliferation and led to increased tumor size and invasiveness in xenograft and orthotopic models. These data provide strong evidence that LARP4B serves as a tumor-suppressor gene in glioma, encouraging further exploration of the RNA targets potentially involved in LARP4B-mediatd growth inhibition.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the impacts of LRIG3 on biological characteristics of glioma and its possible mechanisms. We found that transduction of LRIG3 into glioblastoma cells inhibited cell growth in vitro and in vivo, promoted cell apoptosis, and restrained cell invasion and migration. Further studies demonstrated that LRIG3 negatively regulated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Inhibition of EGFR could reduce the effects of LRIG3 knockdown on cell proliferation and EGFR signaling pathway.

"""The interactome and spatial redistribution feature of Ca(2+) receptor protein calmodulin reveals a novel role in invadopodia-mediated invasion.""","""Numerous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is a major regulator of calcium-dependent signaling, which regulates cell proliferation, programmed cell death, and autophagy in cancer. However, limited information is available on mechanisms underlying the effect of CaM on the invasive property of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, especially with respect to invadopodia formation. In this study, we find that CaM serves as a prognostic factor for GBM, and it is strongly associated with the invasive nature of this tumor. Results of preliminary experiments indicated that CaM concentration was significantly correlated with the invasive capacity of and invadopodia formation by different GBM cell lines. CaM inhibition via a small hairpin RNA or a pharmacological inhibitor significantly disrupted invadopodia formation and MMP activity and downregulated vimentin expression. Moreover, CaM knockdown exerted a strong anti-invasive effect on GBM in vivo. Interestingly, epidermal growth factor treatment promoted CaM redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, eventually activating invadopodia-associated proteins by binding to them via their cytosolic-binding sites. Moreover, CaM inhibition suppressed the activation of invadopodia-associated proteins.

The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of lipophilic antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to increase sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) and suppress glioma cell invasion. To that end, we used a previously established TMZ-resistant RC6 rat glioma cell line, characterized by increased production of ROS, altered antioxidative capacity, and high invasion potential. CoQ10 in combination with TMZ exerted a synergistic antiproliferative effect. These results were confirmed in a 3D model of microfluidic devices showing that the CoQ10 and TMZ combination is more cytotoxic to RC6 cells than TMZ monotherapy. In addition, cotreatment with TMZ increased expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes in RC6 cells. The anti-invasive potential of the combined treatment was shown by gelatin degradation, Matrigel invasion, and 3D spheroid invasion assays as well as in animal models. Inhibition of MMP9 gene expression as well as decreased N-cadherin and vimentin protein expression implied that CoQ10 can suppress invasiveness and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in RC6 cells.

We discovered that microRNA-7 (miR-7) is consistently downregulated in all tumor samples. Using the microRNA.org algorithm, the T-box 2 gene (TBX2) was identified as a candidate gene targeted by miR-7. In contrast to miR-7, TBX2 had an increased expression in GBM tumors and was linked to poor prognosis. We confirmed that TBX2 mRNA and protein production are significantly repressed by overexpressing miR-7 in GBM cells in vitro. The reporter assay showed that miR-7 significantly represses the signal from luciferase with the 3' UTR of TBX2. Furthermore, TBX2 overexpression decreased E-cadherin expression and increased Vimentin expression, causing an increasing number of invaded cells in the invasion assay, as well as pulmonary metastasis in vivo.

CMTMs appeared to be widely regulated in the group of glioblastomas relative to non-neoplastic brain (NB) tissue (significant upregulation for CMTM2, 3, and 6 and significant downregulation for CMTM 4 and 8). For CMTM1, 5 and 7, we found aberrant expression levels in individual tumors. Functionally, CMTM1, 3, and 7 promoted tumor cell invasion, while CMTM1 additionally enhanced cell proliferation. In a large clinically annotated dataset, higher CMTM1 and 3 expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival. Our data thus suggest CMTM1 and 3 as priority targets in glioblastomas.

To elucidate whether, in principle, similar splice-variants could be involved in glioma cell invasion we examined the expression of CD44 and its splice-variants in a series of 38 primary human brain tumors (28 astrocytomas, WHO grade I-III and 10 glioblastomas, WHO grade IV) and in cell lines derived from 9 glioblastomas. All brain tumors examined showed strong immunoreactivity for an N-terminal epitope present on all CD44 isoforms known. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the complete sequence encoded by variant exons v3 to v10, CD44 splice-variants could be detected irrespective of the grade of malignancy in many of the tumor samples at a low level and often restricted to only a few clustered tumor cells. Thus, the N-terminal epitope probably indicates the presence of the smallest and most ubiquitous isoform CD44s. Interestingly, all glioblastomas expressed CD44 variants whereas expression in astrocytomas WHO grade I, II, and III could only be detected in about half of the tumor samples. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR we were able to detect different CD44 splice-variants in the glioblastoma cell lines and in cultured primary astrocytic cells. Glioblastoma cells analyzed by flow cytometry showed the expected binding capacity for hyaluronic acid which could be increased twofold after pretreatment with hyaluronidase. The results presented show that there is low expression of CD44 variants in human tumors of astrocytic origin.

Because the transcription factor RelA/NF-kappaB has been shown to regulate invasion during several cellular processes, we have examined immunohistochemically expression of the constitutively activated RelA/NF-kappaB in tissues obtained from 49 astrocytic tumors [8 diffuse astrocytomas, 9 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and 32 glioblastomas (GBMs)]. In addition, we examined the in vitro effects of antisense oligonucleotides and curcumin on the expression and activation of RelA/NF-kappaB, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) expression, migration, and invasion in the T98G glioma cell line. Expression of the constitutively activated RelA/NF-kappaB was observed in 2 (25%) of 8 cases of diffuse astrocytomas, 5 (55.6%) of 9 cases of AAs, and 30 (93.8%) of 32 cases of GBMs. This expression was significantly correlated with the malignant potential in astrocytic tumors (P < 0.001). Moreover, antisense oligonucleotides and curcumin inhibited phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced RelA/NF-kappaB expression or activation (or both), down-regulated u-PA expression, and reduced the migration and invasive potentials of T98G glioma cells. Thus, the expression of constitutively activated RelA/NF-kappaB is associated with malignancy potential in astrocytic tumors and may play a critical role in the regulation of u-PA expression and invasiveness in gliomas.

"""Comparative molecular genetic profiles of anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas multiforme and their subsequent recurrences.""","""Malignant glial tumors (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme) arise mostly either from the progression of low grade precursor lesions or rapidly in a de novo fashion and contain distinct genetic alterations. There is, however, a third subset of malignant gliomas in which genetic lesions remain to be identified. Following surgical resection, all gliomas appear to have an inherent tendency to recur. Comparative molecular analysis of ten primary malignant gliomas (three anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas multiforme) with their recurrences identified two distinct subgroups of recurrent tumors. In one group, primary tumors harbored genetic aberrations frequently associated with linear progression or de novo formation pathways of glial tumorigenesis and maintained their genetic profiles upon recurrence. In the other subset with no detectable known genetic mutations at first presentation, the recurrent tumors sustained specific abnormalities associated with pathways of linear progression or de novo formation. These included loss of genes on chromosomes 17 and 10, mutations in the p53 gene, homozygous deletion of the DMBTA1 and p16 and/ or p15 genes and amplification and/or overexpression of CDK4 and alpha form of the PDGF receptor. Recurrent tumors from both groups also displayed an abnormal expression profile of the metalloproteinase, gel A, and its inhibitor, TIMP-2, consistent with their highly invasive behavior. Delineation of the molecular differences between malignant glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences may have important implications for the development of rational clinical approaches for this neoplasm that remains refractory to existing therapeutic modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10022821
"""Role of galectin-1 in migration and invasion of human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines.""","""Object: Galectin-1 is highly expressed in motile cell lines. The authors investigated whether galectin-1 actually modulates the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines, and whether its expression with respect to invasion and prognosis is attributable to certain glioma subgroups. Methods: In the human GBM cell lines U343MG-A, U87MG, and U87MG-10', the RNA differential display was evaluated using Genefishing technology. The results were validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis to detect possible genetic changes as the determining factors for the motility of the malignant glioma. The migration and invasion abilities were investigated in human GBM cell lines and galectin-1 transfectant using an in vitro brain slice invasion model and a simple scratch technique. The morphological and cytoskeletal (such as the development of actin and vimentin) changes were examined under light and confocal microscopy. Galectin-1 expression was assessed on immunohistochemical tests and Western blot analysis. Results: Endogenous galectin-1 expression in the human GBM cell lines was statistically correlated with migratory abilities and invasiveness. The U87-G-AS cells became more round than the U87MG cells and lacked lamellipodia. On immunohistochemical staining, galectin-1 expression was increased in higher-grade glioma subgroups (p = 0.027). Conclusions: Diffuse gliomas demonstrated higher expression levels than pilocytic astrocytoma in the Western blot. Galectin-1 appears to modulate migration and invasion in human glioma cell lines and may play a role in tumor progression and invasiveness in human gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18671640
"""Transforming growth factor-beta: a molecular target for the future therapy of glioblastoma.""","""The median survival of patients with glioblastoma treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is in the range of 12 months. These limits in the efficacy of current treatment modalities call for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the specific biological features of this type of cancer. Glioblastomas are a rich source of immunosuppressive molecules which may interfere with immune recognition and rejection as well as clinical strategies of active immunotherapy. The most prominent glioblastoma-associated immunosuppressant is the cytokine, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a multifunctional cytokine which not only interferes with multiple steps of afferent and efferent immune responses, but also stimulates migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The complex regulation of TGF-beta bioavailability includes its synthesis as a proprotein, proteolytic processing by furin-like proteases, assembly in a latent complex, and finally liberation from latency by multiple effector mechanisms, a process collectively referred to as activation. Several in vitro paradigms and rodent glioma models have been used to demonstrate that the antagonism of TGF-beta holds promise for the treatment of glioblastoma, employing antisense strategies, inhibition of pro-TGF-beta processing, scavenging TGF-beta by decorin, or blocking TGF-beta activity by specific TGF-beta receptor (TGF-betaR) I kinase antagonists. Moreover, the local application of TGF-beta(2) antisense oligonucleotides is currently evaluated in a randomized clinical trial for recurrent malignant glioma. In summary, we propose that TGF-beta-antagonistic treatment strategies are among the most promising of the current innovative approaches for glioblastoma, particularly in conjunction with novel approaches of cellular immunotherapy and vaccination.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16454748
"""Gamma distribution model of diffusion MRI for evaluating the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status of glioblastomas.""","""Objective: To determine whether the Î³ distribution (GD) model of diffusion MRI is useful in the evaluation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status of glioblastomas. Methods: 12 patients with IDH-mutant glioblastomas and 54 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging using 13 b-values from 0 to 1000 s/mm2. The shape parameter (Îº) and scale parameter (Î¸) were obtained with the GD model. Fractions of three different areas under the probability density function curve (f1, f2, f3) were defined as follows: f1, diffusion coefficient (D) < 1.0Ã10-3 mm2/s; f2, D > 1.0Ã10-3 and <3.0Ã10-3 mm2/s; f3, D > 3.0 Ã 10-3 mm2/s. The GD model-derived parameters measured in gadolinium-enhancing lesions were compared between the IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype groups. Receiver operating curve analyses were performed to assess the parameters' diagnostic performances. Results: The IDH-mutant group's f1 (0.474 Â± 0.143) was significantly larger than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.347 Â± 0.122, p = 0.0024). The IDH-mutant group's f2 (0.417 Â± 0.131) was significantly smaller than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.504 Â± 0.126, p = 0.036). The IDH-mutant group's f3 (0.109 Â± 0.060) was significantly smaller than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.149 Â± 0.063, p = 0.0466). The f1 showed the best diagnostic performance among the GD model-derived parameters with the area under the curve value of 0.753. Conclusion: The GD model could well describe the pathological features of IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and was useful in the differentiation of these tumors. Advances in knowledge: Diffusion MRI based on the Î³ distribution model could well describe the pathological features of IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and its use enabled the significant differentiation of these tumors.

"""Temporal Glioblastoma Mimicking Basal Ganglia Invasion: Distinguishing Removable and Unremovable Tumors.""","""Objective: Maximal safe resection prolongs the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GB). However, whether total resection of the enhanced lesion is pursued or abandoned depends on preoperative judgments based on the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anatomically, medial temporal tumor tends to invade toward the temporal stem, insula, and basal ganglia, representing tumor with high surgical risk. In the present study, we describe the key radiologic features of medial temporal GB to achieve extent of resection. Methods: We reviewed all GB cases located in the temporal lobe (tGB) treated between April 2013 and March 2018 at Kitasato University Hospital. On the basis of MRI, tGB was simply classified into 3 groups: medial tGB and nonmedial tGB, and medial tGB was further subdivided into invading type and mimicking type. We focused on the resectability of medial tGB. Results: Twenty-seven patients with tGB were identified. Twenty were included in the nonmedial tGB, and 7 were in the medial tGB. All medial tGB seemed to invade into the basal ganglia and/or the lenticulostriate arteries, but detailed examination revealed 2 types of tumor, invading type (3 cases) and mimicking type (4 cases). The invading type had true involvement of the basal ganglia and/or lenticulostriate arteries, whereas the mimicking type had no involvement of these structures. This new classification is highly effective, as the former is unresectable, but the latter is totally resectable. Conclusions: Medial tGB is a challenging tumor for maximal safe resection, so our classification will help to identify cases of removable medial tGB.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31252080
"""Nogo receptor-vimentin interaction: a novel mechanism for the invasive activity of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Nogo receptor (NgR) has been shown to inhibit the migration and invasion of human glioma cells. However, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms of NgR in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this study, we propose a novel mechanism that regulates the maturation process of NgR through an interaction with vimentin. The inhibition of TGFÎ²1 activity by LY2109761 attenuated the migration/invasion of GBM cells by upregulating cell-surface NgR. Conversely, the treatment of GBM cells with TGFÎ²1 suppressed NgR maturation. We showed that NgR and vimentin interact, which could be a possible mechanism for the suppression of NgR maturation. The knockdown of vimentin suppressed the migration/invasion of GBM cells through the increased maturation of NgR. Finally, TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) analysis also supported the association of NgR and vimentin. The maturation of NgR is regulated by the interaction of vimentin and NgR, which attenuates the invasive activity of GBM, and might be a potential therapeutic target for brain cancer.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31649250
"""Hypoxia enhances the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells through PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1alpha pathway.""","""Widespread invasiveness, represented by the invasion and migration, is the most important characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is the main reason for therapeutic failure and recurrence of the tumor. Hypoxia is one of the main microenvironment in determining tumor invasiveness. Therefore, intense efforts aimed at improved therapeutics are ongoing to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms governing GBM migration and invasion. This study aims to explore the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway and its relationship with hypoxia inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) in the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells under hypoxia. In the study, we found that hypoxia could activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway associated with the enhancements of the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells. When the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and HIF-1Î± were inhibited by the siRNAs or inhibitors, the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells were suppressed. Meanwhile, the expression of HIF-1Î± could be inhibited by the siRNA or inhibitors of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The aforementioned results demonstrate that hypoxia could induce enhancements of migration and invasion by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by targeting HIF-1Î± in human glioblastoma U87 cells, which provide a theoretical basis for the treatments of GBM by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1Î± pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30371540
"""Suppression of tumorigenicity, but not invasion, in glioblastoma/HeLa cell hybrids.""","""Somatic cell hybrids between SNB-19 human glioblastoma cells and human D98OR HeLa cells were produced and analyzed for their ability to form tumors in nude mice and to invade reconstituted extracellular matrix (Matrigel). Whereas both the SNB-19 and D98OR HeLa parental cells form tumors, four of six hybrid lines did not form tumors, even after periods up to six months, suggesting that each cell type can complement the tumorigenicity of the other. SNB-19 cells showed high rates of Matrigel invasion at all cell densities examined, whereas D98OR HeLa cells showed lower rates of invasion that were further reduced at high cell density. All six hybrid cell lines displayed a combination of these properties: at low cell density, the hybrids showed high rates of invasion, similar to the SNB-19 cells, but the invasion rate diminished at higher cell densities, similar to the D98OR HeLa cells.

"""The angiogenic switch leads to a metabolic shift in human glioblastoma.""","""Background: Invasion and angiogenesis are major hallmarks of glioblastoma (GBM) growth. While invasive tumor cells grow adjacent to blood vessels in normal brain tissue, tumor cells within neovascularized regions exhibit hypoxic stress and promote angiogenesis. The distinct microenvironments likely differentially affect metabolic processes within the tumor cells. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed gene expression and metabolic changes in a human GBM xenograft model that displayed invasive and angiogenic phenotypes. In addition, we used glioma patient biopsies to confirm the results from the xenograft model. Results: We demonstrate that the angiogenic switch in our xenograft model is linked to a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition that is associated with upregulation of the transcription factors BHLHE40, CEBPB, and STAT3. Metabolic analyses revealed that angiogenic xenografts employed higher rates of glycolysis compared with invasive xenografts. Likewise, patient biopsies exhibited higher expression of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1 in hypoxic areas compared with the invasive edge and lower-grade tumors. Analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain showed reduction of complex I in angiogenic xenografts and hypoxic regions of GBM samples compared with invasive xenografts, nonhypoxic GBM regions, and lower-grade tumors. In vitro hypoxia experiments additionally revealed metabolic adaptation of invasive tumor cells, which increased lactate production under long-term hypoxia. Conclusions: The use of glycolysis versus mitochondrial respiration for energy production within human GBM tumors is highly dependent on the specific microenvironment. The metabolic adaptability of GBM cells highlights the difficulty of targeting one specific metabolic pathway for effective therapeutic intervention.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27591677
"""Glioblastoma hijacks microglial gene expression to support tumor growth.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and lethal primary brain tumors. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, survey their environment and respond to pathogens, toxins, and tumors. Glioblastoma cells communicate with microglia, in part by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite the presence of large numbers of microglia in glioblastoma, the tumors continue to grow, and these neuroimmune cells appear incapable of keeping the tumor in check. To understand this process, we analyzed gene expression in microglia interacting with glioblastoma cells. Methods: We used RNASeq of isolated microglia to analyze the expression patterns of genes involved in key microglial functions in mice with glioblastoma. We focused on microglia that had taken up tumor-derived EVs and therefore were within and immediately adjacent to the tumor. Results: We show that these microglia have downregulated expression of genes involved in sensing tumor cells and tumor-derived danger signals, as well as genes used for tumor killing. In contrast, expression of genes involved in facilitating tumor spread was upregulated. These changes appear to be in part EV-mediated, since intracranial injection of EVs in normal mice led to similar transcriptional changes in microglia. We observed a similar microglial transcriptomic signature when we analyzed datasets from human patients with glioblastoma. Conclusion: Our data define a microgliaGlioblastoma specific phenotype, whereby glioblastomas have hijacked gene expression in the neuroimmune system to favor avoiding tumor sensing, suppressing the immune response, clearing a path for invasion, and enhancing tumor propagation. For further exploration, we developed an interactive online tool at http://www.glioma-microglia.com with all expression data and additional functional and pathway information for each gene.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32299465

Radiotherapy is a cornerstone in the management of GBMs; however, resistance to treatment poses a substantial obstacle. This study investigates the role of adipokine C1q/TNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1) in the radio-sensitivity of GBMs, utilizing both X-ray and carbon ion irradiation. Expression analyses revealed elevated CTRP1 and CD133 levels in GBMs tissues, which were associated with poor patient survival. Carbon ion irradiation demonstrated superior growth inhibition compared to X-ray, particularly in U87 (high CD133) cells. Moreover, CTRP1 expression increased following radiation exposure, especially after X-ray treatment. Knockdown of CTRP1 enhanced radio-sensitivity by reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis, while exacerbating oxidative stress. Bioinformatics analysis revealed CTRP1's involvement in DNA damage repair pathways. Our findings establish a novel connection between CTRP1 and cellular radio-sensitivity.

ATO further upregulated expression of Bax as an important proapoptotic target of NF-ÎºB and also inhibited mRNA expression of survivin, c-Myc and hTERT and suppressed telomerase activity. Moreover, ATO significantly increased adhesion of U87MG cells and also diminished transcription of NF-ÎºB down-stream targets involved in cell migration and invasion, including cathepsin B, uPA, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14 and suppressed proteolytic activity of cathepsin B, MMP-2 and MMP-9, demonstrating a possible mechanism of ATO effect on a well-known signaling in glioblastoma dissemination.

Eight diffuse astrocytomas and 19 glioblastomas (WHO IV) were analyzed to determine if TIMP-1 and NM23-H1 were candidates to inhibition of tumor cell invasion quantitated RNA levels. The samples were collected directly from operating room. Total cellular RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using guanidinium-isothiocyanate and cesium chloride gradients. Total RNA (10 mg per sample) from tumor tissue were size fractionated through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon filters and then hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes and placed for autoradiography. Levels of specific RNAs were determined by computer-assisted laser densitometry. Blot filters were sequentially hybridized to nm23 and TIMP-1 probes in addition to GAPDH, as a control. Statistical analyses were carried out according to t-test for equality of means. Results: NM23-H1 were detected in each sample, however it did not correlate with malignancy and invasiveness. On the other side TIMP-1 gene expression showed a clear correlation between low expression and invasiveness. Conclusion: The data suggest that TIMP-1 is an inhibitor of high grade gliomas invasion.

Matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 and cathepsin B have been shown to participate in the processes of tumor growth, vascularization and invasion of gliomas. In the present study, we used a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-triggered RNA interference (RNAi) to block MMP-9 and cathepsin B gene expression with a single construct. Transfection of a plasmid vector-expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited MMP-9 and cathepsin B expression and reduced the invasive behavior of SNB19, glioblastoma cell line in Matrigel and spheroid invasion models. Downregulation of MMP-9 and cathepsin B using RNAi in SNB19 cells reduced cell-cell interaction of human microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in the disruption of capillary network formation in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Ironically, studies have recently revealed that radiation can augment malignant progression, by promoting migration and invasion, which make the disease especially difficult to cure. Here, we investigated the anticancer effects of YM155, a purported radiosensitizer, in GBM cell lines. Methods: GBM cell lines U251 and U87 were treated with YM155 to assess cytotoxicity and activity of the molecule in vitro. Nude mice were implanted with cells to generate orthotopic xenografts for in vivo studies. Response of cells to treatment was examined using cell viability, immunofluorescence, wound healing, and the Transwell invasion assay. Molecules potentially mediating response were examined through western blot analysis, phospho-kinase arrays, and qPCR. Cells were transfected with siRNA knockdown and gene expression constructs to identify molecular mediators of response. Results: YM155 reduced viability of U251 and U87 cells and enhanced radiosensitivity through inhibition of homologous recombination. Besides, YM155 decreased invasion caused by radiation and led to expression changes in molecular markers associated with EMT. STAT3 was one of 10 molecules identified on a phosphokinase array exhibiting significant change in phosphorylation under YM155 treatment. Transfection with STAT3 siRNAs or expression constructs demonstrated that EMT changes were achieved by inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3 and were survivin-independent.

The key properties of GBM, stemness and invasiveness, are known to be associated with a highly unfavorable prognosis. Notably, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely related to the progression of GBM. On the basis of reports that 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) and its derivative, 2'-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA), suppresses EMT in several human cancer cells, we sought to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HCA and BCA, alone and in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), on GBM tumorspheres (TSs). Methods: Two human GBM TSs were treated with HCA, BCA, or TMZ. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by measuring ATP levels, neurosphere formation, 3D-invasion in collagen matrix, and viability. Protein expression profiles after drug treatment were evaluated by western blotting. In vivo anticancer efficacy of drugs was examined in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Results: Combined treatment of GBM TSs with HCA or BCA and TMZ significantly reduced cell viability, stemness, and invasiveness. Expression levels of stemness-, invasiveness-, and mesenchymal transition-associated markers, Zeb1, N-cadherin, and Î²-catenin, were also substantially decreased by the combined treatment. The combined treatment also reduced tumor growth in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model.

Previously, we demonstrated that Pyk2 and FAK are involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and proliferation and are associated with reduced overall survival. We hypothesized that the use of inhibitors of Pyk2/FAK in the postsurgical period may reduce the growth of recurrent tumors. Using Western blot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence approaches, we demonstrated upregulation of Cyclin D1 and the Ki67 proliferation index in tumors regrown after resection, compared with primary implanted tumors. Treatment with Pyk2/FAK inhibitor PF-562271, administered through oral gavage at 50 mg/kg daily for two weeks beginning 2 days before tumor resection, reversed Pyk2/FAK signaling upregulation in recurrent tumors, reduced tumor volume, and increased animal survival.

The results of GESA suggested that SC might regulate the expression of genes associated with migration and invasion and affect the activity of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Western blotting revealed that Sanggenon C promoted the ubiquitination of Î²-catenin to reduce the levels of Î²-catenin and its downstream proteins. This was further supported by the results of real-time qPCR analysis of target genes of Î²-catenin. Taken together, SC inhibits glioblastoma cell migration and invasion by enhancing Î²-catenin ubiquitination. Our work suggests a new direction for the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38369839
"""YKL-40 downregulation is a key factor to overcome temozolomide resistance in a glioblastoma cell line.""","""The frequent recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after standard treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) is a crucial issue to be solved in the clinical field. O6âmethylguanineâDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is considered one of the major mechanisms involved in TMZ resistance. However, some important mechanisms for TMZ resistance other than MGMT have recently been identified. In the present study, we established a TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) U87 glioblastoma cell line in vitro and in vivo and investigated novel targeting molecules other than MGMT in those cells. The TMZ-R U87 glioblastoma cell line was established in vitro and in vivo. TMZ-R U87 cells showed a more invasive activity and a shorter survival time in vivo. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that YKLâ40, MAGEC1 and MGMT mRNA expression was upregulated 100-, 83- and 6-fold, respectively in the TMZ-R U87 cell line. Western blot analysis and qPCR demonstrated that STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 target genes and stem cell and mesenchymal marker genes were upregulated to a greater extent in the TMZâresistant cell line. Notably, short hairpin (sh)RNAâbased inhibition against the YKLâ40 gene resulted in moderate growth inhibition in the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, YKLâ40 gene inhibition exhibited significant suppression of the invasive activity and particularly partially restored the sensitivity to TMZ. Therefore, YKLâ40 may be a novel key molecule in addition to MGMT, that is responsible for TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cell lines and could be a new target to overcome TMZ resistance in recurrent glioblastomas in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24842123
"""Ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme through Akt-regulated MMP13.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant type of primary brain tumor. Although the growth of the tumor cells in a relatively closed space may partially account for its malignancy, highly invasive nature of glioblastoma cells has been suggested to be the main reason for the failure of current therapeutic approaches. Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) has recently been shown to significantly suppress the growth and survival of GBM through inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, whereas its effects on the invasion and metastasis have not been examined. Here, we showed that GRh2 dose-dependently decreased GBM cell invasiveness in both scratch wound healing assay and Transwell cell migration assay. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of GRh2 on cell migration seemed to be conducted through decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. Furthermore, using specific inhibitors, we found that GRh2 inhibited MMP13 through PI3k/Akt signaling pathway. Finally, high MMP13 levels were detected in GBM specimen from the patients. Together, these data suggest that GRh2 may suppress GBM migration through inhibiting Akt-mediated MMP13 activation. Thus, our data highlight a previous unappreciated role for GRh2 in suppressing GBM cell metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25835975

Methods: Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assay were adopted for the analysis of cell viability. Cell invasion and migration were evaluated by transwell and wound healing assays. Then, the expression level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), S6 and phosphorylated S6 (p-S6) were determined by western blotting. Results: The results showed that JLC significantly inhibited human glioblastoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. The expressions of p-mTOR and p-S6 were dramatically suppressed by JLC. Furtherly, inhibition of mTOR reduced the cell migration and invasion, while the mTOR agonist (MHY1485) could partially reverse the anti-migration and anti-invasion activity of JLC.

"""An integrated computational/experimental model of tumor invasion.""","""The intracellular and extracellular dynamics that govern tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo remain poorly understood. Cell genotype and phenotype, and nutrient, oxygen, and growth factor concentrations are key variables. In previous work, using a reaction-diffusion mathematical model based on variables that directly describe tumor cell cycle and biology, we formulated the hypothesis that tumor morphology is determined by the competition between heterogeneous cell proliferation caused by spatial diffusion gradients, e.g., of cell nutrients, driving shape instability and invasive tumor morphologies, and stabilizing mechanical forces, e.g., cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we here obtain variable-based statistics for input to the mathematical model from in vitro human and rat glioblastoma cultures. A linear stability analysis of the model predicts that glioma spheroid morphology is marginally stable. In agreement with this prediction, for a range of variable values, unbounded growth of the tumor mass and invasion of the environment are observed in vitro. The mechanism of invasion is recursive subspheroid component development at the tumor viable rim and separation from the parent spheroid. Results of computer simulations of the mathematical model closely resemble the morphologies and spatial arrangement of tumor cells from the in vitro model. We propose that tumor morphogenesis in vivo may be a function of marginally stable environmental conditions caused by spatial variations in cell nutrients, oxygen, and growth factors, and that controlling these conditions by decreasing spatial gradients could benefit treatment outcomes, whereas current treatment, and especially antiangiogenic therapy, may trigger spatial heterogeneity (e.g., local hypoxia), thus causing invasive instability.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16452218
"""Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) inhibits glioblastoma development by regulating mitochondria dynamics.""","""Glioblastoma(GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive malignant primary tumors of the central nervous system and mitochondria have been proposed to participate in GBM tumorigenesis. Previous studies have identified a potential role of Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a multi-compartmentalized protein, in mitochondria. But whether DISC1 could regulate GBM tumorigenesis via mitochondria is still unknown. We determined the expression level of DISC1 by both bioinformatics analysis and tissue analysis, and found that DISC1 was highly expressed in GBM. Knocking down of DISC1 by shRNA in GBM cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, down-regulation of DISC1 decreased cell migration and invasion of GBM and self renewal capacity of glioblastoma stem-like cells. Furthermore, multiple independent rings or spheres could be observed in mitochondria in GBM depleted of DISC1, while normal filamentous morphology was observed in control cells, demonstrating that DISC1 affected the mitochondrial dynamic. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) was reported to contribute to mitochondrial dynamic regulation and influence glioma cells proliferation and invasion by RHOA/ ROCK1 pathway. Our data showed a significant decrease of Drp1 both in mRNA and protein level in GBM lack of DISC1, indicating that DISC1 maybe affect the mitochondrial dynamic by regulating Drp1. Taken together, our findings reveal that DISC1 affects glioblastoma cell development via mitochondria dynamics partly by down regulation of Drp1.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27852062
"""Identifying new small molecule anti-invasive compounds for glioma treatment.""","""Glioblastoma is a disease with poor survival rates after diagnosis. Treatment of the disease involves debulking of the tumor, which is limited by the degree of invasiveness of the disease. Therefore, a treatment to halt the invasion of glioma is desirable for clinical implementation. There have been several candidate compounds targeting specific aspects of invasion, including cell adhesions, matrix degradation, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, but they have failed clinically for a variety of reasons. New targets against glioma invasion include upstream mediators of these classical targets in an effort to better inhibit invasion with more specificity for cancer. Included in these treatments is a new class of compounds inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species by targeting the NADPH oxidases. These compounds stand to inhibit multiple pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B and Akt. By conducting a screen of compounds thought to inhibit these pathways, a new compound to halt invasion was found that may have a beneficial effect against glioma, based on recent publications.

Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with both antiangiogenic and antitumor activities due to selective inhibition of various receptor tyrosine kinases, including those important for angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors). Here we evaluated the antitumor activities of sunitinib on orthotopic models of GBM in vitro and in vivo. Sunitinib potently inhibited angiogenesis that was stimulated by implantation of U87MG and GL15 cells into organotypic brain slices at concentrations as low as 10 nM. At high dose (10 microM), sunitinib induced direct antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on GL15 cells and decreased invasion of these cells implanted into brain slices by 49% (p < 0.001). Treatment was associated with decreases in Src (35%) and focal adhesion kinase (44%) phosphorylation. However, anti-invasive activity was not observed in vivo at the highest dose level utilized (80 mg/kg per day). Survival experiments involving athymic mice bearing intracerebral U87MG GBM demonstrated that oral administration of 80 mg/kg sunitinib (five days on, two days off) improved median survival by 36% (p < 0.0001). Sunitinib treatment caused a 74% reduction in microvessel density (p < 0.05), an increase in tumor necrosis, and a decrease in number of GBM cells positive for MIB antibody. Sunitinib exhibited potent antiangiogenic activity that was associated with a meaningful prolongation of survival of mice bearing intracerebral GBM.

Several circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been observed to exert functions in GBM. The current study is aimed to explore the potential mechanism of circ_0074027 via miR-518a-5p and IL17RD in GBM progression. Circ_0074027 expression was determined in a cohort of 50 pairs of GBM specimens and five cell lines by qRT-PCR. In addition, the association between circ_0074027 expression and its clinical value was analyzed by Fisher's exact test.

"""p300- and Myc-mediated regulation of glioblastoma multiforme cell differentiation.""","""Tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells is, in part, attributable to their undifferentiated (neural stem cell-like) phenotype. Astrocytic differentiation of GBM cells is associated with transcriptional induction of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and repression of Nestin, whereas the reciprocal transcription program operates in undifferentiated GBM cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these transcription programs remain elusive. Here, we show that the transcriptional co-activator p300 was expressed in GBM tumors and cell lines and acted as an activator of the GFAP gene and a repressor of the Nestin gene. On the other hand, Myc (formerly known as c-Myc overrode these p300 functions by repressing the GFAP gene and inducing the Nestin gene in GBM cells. Moreover, RNAi-mediated inhibition of p300 expression significantly enhanced the invasion potential of GBM cells in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that dedifferentiated/undifferentiated GBM cells are more invasive than differentiated GBM cells.

"""Expression pattern of EEF1A2 in brain tumors: Histological analysis and functional role as a promoter of EMT.""","""Aims: Glioblastomas are highly aggressive brain tumors with a very poor survival rate. EEF1A2, the proto-oncogenic isoform of the EEF1A translation factor family, has been found to be overexpressed and promoting tumorigenesis in multiple cancers. Interestingly, recent studies reported reduced expression of this protein in brain tumors, drawing our attention to find the functional role and mechanism of this protein in brain tumor progression. Main methods: Using representative cell line as models, the role of EEF1A2 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed using MTS assay, scratch wound-healing assay, transwell migration and invasion assay, respectively. Activation of key signaling pathways was assessed using western blots and real-time PCR. Finally, using immunohistochemistry we checked the protein levels of EEF1A2 in CNS tumors. Key findings: EEF1A2 was found to increase the proliferative, migratory and invasive properties of cell lines of both glial and neuronal origin. PI3K activation directly correlated with EEF1A2 levels. Protein levels of key EMT markers viz. Twist, Snail, and Slug were increased upon ectopic EEF1A2 expression. Furthermore, EEF1A2 was found to affect the expression levels of key inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteases. IHC analysis showed that EEF1A2 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue. Significance: EEF1A2 acts as an oncogene in both neuronal and glial cells and triggers an EMT program via PI3K pathway.

Both cell populations contribute to tumour aggressiveness and immune evasion through the actions of various signalling molecules. The scavenger and pattern recognition receptor CD204 is associated with a pro-tumourigenic phenotype of TAMs and has a negative prognostic value. Our objective was to investigate the possible interaction between TAMs and dedifferentiated glioblastoma cells and characterise the myeloid phenotype of CD204-enriched glioblastomas. Methods: Double immunohistochemistry and cell counting was performed on eight glioblastoma samples to estimate the expression and interaction level between dedifferentiated/stem-like tumour cells and TAMs. Using the NanoString technology, myeloid transcriptome profiling was performed on 46 glioblastomas, which had been selected based on their protein expression levels of CD204 and ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA1). The results were validated by immunohistochemistry and in silico gene expression analyses. Results: TAMs especially CD204+ TAMs accumulated in perivascular and perinecrotic niches in close proximity to podoplanin+ glioblastoma cells. Gene profiling revealed that CD204-enriched glioblastoma has a unique signature with upregulation of genes related to hypoxia, angiogenesis and invasion, including interleukin-6. The gene signature favoured a poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. Conclusions: This is the first study to characterise the role of CD204 in the myeloid microenvironment of glioblastoma. Our results support the unfavourable prognostic impact of CD204 and suggest that CD204 and interleukin-6 could serve as targets for re-education of TAMs and potentiation of current anti-glioma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713474

The Akt/protein kinase B, serine/threonine kinase is well known as an important mediator of many cell survival signaling pathways. In the present study, we demonstrate that down-regulation of Akt is a major effect of anti-invasiveness property of sulindac and its metabolites in glioblastoma cells. Myristoylated Akt (MyrAkt) transfected U87MG glioblastoma cells showed increase invasiveness, whereas DN-Akt transfected cells showed decrease invasiveness indicating that Akt potently promoted glioblastoma cell invasion. MMP-2 promoter and enzyme activity were up-regulated in Akt kinase activity dependent manner. Sulindac and its metabolites down-regulated Akt phosphorylation, inhibited MMP-2 production, and significantly inhibited invasiveness of human glioblastoma cells. In addition, sulindac and LY294002, a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), synergistically inhibited the invasion of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, only celecoxib showed Akt phosphorylation reduction and an anti-invasivness in glioblastoma cells, whereas aspirin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, and naproxen did not.

"""Strategies of Mesenchymal Invasion of Patient-derived Brain Tumors: Microenvironmental Adaptation.""","""The high mortality in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients is primarily caused by extensive infiltration into adjacent tissue and subsequent rapid recurrence. There are no clear therapeutic strategies that target the infiltrative subpopulation of GBM mass. Using mesenchymal mode of invasion, the GBM is known to widely infiltrate by interacting with various unique components within brain microenvironment such as hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich matrix and white matter tracts. However, it is unclear how these GBM microenvironments influence the strategies of mesenchymal invasion. We hypothesize that GBM has different strategies to facilitate such invasion through adaptation to their local microenvironment. Using our in vitro biomimetic microenvironment platform for three-dimensional GBM tumorspheres (TSs), we found that the strategies of GBM invasion were predominantly regulated by the HA-rich ECM microenvironment, showing marked phenotypic changes in the presence of HA, which were mainly mediated by HA synthase (HAS). Interestingly, after inhibition of the HAS gene, GBM switched their invasion strategies to a focal adhesion (FA)-mediated invasion. These results demonstrate that the microenvironmental adaptation allowed a flexible invasion strategy for GBM.

This study aims to correlate the immunoexpression of angiogenesis markers (CD34, CD105) with the proliferation index Ki67 and p53 in primary and secondary glioblastomas. This retrospective study included 54 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma at the Pathology Department of County Emergency Clinical Hospital TÃ¢rgu MureÈ. Microvascular density was determined using CD34 and CD105 antibodies, and the results were correlated with the immunoexpression of p53, IDH1, ATRX and Ki67.

Despite advances in treatment, patient survival remains low. GBM diagnosis typically relies on imaging techniques and postoperative pathological diagnosis; however, both procedures have their inherent limitations. Imaging modalities cannot differentiate tumour progression from treatment-related changes that mimic progression, known as pseudoprogression, which might lead to misinterpretation of therapy response and delay clinical interventions. In addition to imaging limitations, tissue biopsies are invasive and most of the time cannot be performed over the course of treatment to evaluate 'real-time' tumour dynamics. In an attempt to address these limitations, liquid biopsies have been proposed in the field. Blood sampling is a minimally invasive procedure for a patient to endure and could provide tumoural information to guide therapy. Tumours shed tumoural content, such as circulating tumour cells, cell-free nucleic acids, proteins and extracellular vesicles, into the circulation, and these biomarkers are reported to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Results: The numbers of VM were positively associated with disease progression, but negatively with PFS periods of GBM patients. Compared with the control vec cells, lncRNA HULC overexpression significantly increased the tubular formation, invasion, and EMT process of both SHG44 and U87 cells, accompanied by promoting the growth of implanted GBM tumors and EMT process in mice.

Different TRIM24 expression levels in patients' tumors, as measured by both immunohistochemistry and western blot, were related to their corresponding MRI data. Wound healing, Matrigel invasion, and xenograft immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine GBM cell invasion. Results: We identified that TRIM24 was coexpressed with CD133 and Nestin in GBM tissues and tumorsphere cells. Limiting dilution assays and xenotransplantation experiments illustrated that knockdown of TRIM24 expression reduced GSC self-renewal capacity and invasive growth. TRIM24 expression levels were positively associated with the volumes of peritumoral T2 weighted image abnormality. Rescue experiments indicated TRIM24 participation in GBM infiltrative dissemination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter gene assay, PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that TRIM24 activated the expression of the pluripotency transcription factor sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) to regulate GBM stemness and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the close relationship between TRIM24 and Sox2 was validated by testing samples enrolled in our study and exploring external databases. Conclusions: Our findings uncover essential roles of the TRIM24-Sox2 axis in GBM stemness and invasiveness, suggesting TRIM24 as a potential target for effective GBM management.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492707
"""Modeling the efficacy of the extent of surgical resection in the setting of radiation therapy for glioblastoma.""","""Standard therapy for glioblastoma (GBM) includes maximal surgical resection and radiation therapy. While it is established that radiation therapy provides the greatest survival benefit of standard treatment modalities, the impact of the extent of surgical resection (EOR) on patient outcome remains highly controversial. While some studies describe no correlation between EOR and patient survival even up to total resection, others propose either qualitative (partial versus subtotal versus complete resection) or quantitative EOR thresholds, below which there is no correlation with survival. This work uses a mathematical model in the form of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation to simulate tumor growth and treatment with radiation therapy and surgical resection based on tumor-specific rates of diffusion and proliferation. Simulation of 36 tumors across a wide spectrum of diffusion and proliferation rates suggests that while partial or subtotal resections generally do not provide a survival advantage, complete resection significantly improves patient outcomes. Furthermore, our model predicts a tumor-specific quantitative threshold below which EOR has no effect on patient survival and demonstrates that this threshold increases with tumor aggressiveness, particularly with the rate of proliferation. Thus, this model may serve as an aid for determining both when surgical resection is indicated as well as the surgical margins necessary to provide clinically significant improvements in patient survival. In addition, by assigning relative benefits to radiation and surgical resection based on tumor invasiveness and proliferation, this model confirms that (with the exception of the least aggressive tumors) the survival benefit of radiation therapy exceeds that of surgical resection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27240229

Previous investigations have demonstrated that modeled microgravity (MMG) could decline the cell proliferation and attenuate the metastasis potential in several cell lines. In this study, we studied the effects of MMG on the invasion and migration potentials of glioblastoma in human glioblastoma U87 cells. We found that MMG stimulation significantly attenuated the invasion and migration potentials, decreased thapsigargin (TG) induced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and downregulated the expression of Orai1 in U87 cells. Inhibition of SOCE by 2-APB or stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) downregulation both mimicked the effects of MMG on the invasion and migration potentials in U87 cells. Furthermore, upregulation of Orai1 significantly weakened the effects of MMG on the invasion and migration potentials in U87 cells. Therefore, these findings indicated that MMG stimulation inhibited the invasion and migration potentials of U87 cells by downregulating the expression of Orai1 and sequentially decreasing the SOCE, suggesting that MMG might be a new potential therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma treatment in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25580009

We present a simple, heuristic algorithm for automated invasive radii estimation (AIRE) that uses local fluctuations of the image intensity. We then derive an analytical expression relating the image graininess to the cell density for a model imaging system.

"""Neutralization of the CD95 ligand by APG101 inhibits invasion of glioma cells in vitro.""","""Glioblastoma is a disease characterized by rapid invasive tumour growth. Studies on the proapoptotic CD95/CD95L signalling pathway recently suggested a significant contribution of CD95 signalling towards the high degree of motility in glioma cells. Apogenix has developed APG101, a clinical phase II compound designed to bind and neutralize CD95L, and thus to interfere with CD95/CD95L-based signalling. APG101 has shown clinical efficacy in a controlled randomized phase II trial in patients with recurrent glioma. Because APG101 is not cytotoxic to tumour cells in vitro, we postulated that the anti-invasive function of APG101 is the main mechanism of action for this compound. Using three-dimensional spheroid invasion assays in vitro and in murine brain tissue cultures, we found that knockdown of endogenous CD95L reduced the invasive phenotype in our two glioblastoma model cell lines U87-MG and U251-MG. Invasion was restored in CD95L knockdown cells upon the addition of soluble recombinant CD95L and this effect was inhibited by APG101. We conclude that CD95L from autocrine and paracrine sources contributes towards the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells and that APG101 acts as a suppressor of proinvasive signalling by the CD95/CD95L pathway in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25850884

As with other cancers, the incidence of glioblastoma is increasing; despite modern therapies, the overall mean survival of patients post-diagnosis averages around 16 months, a figure that has not changed in many years. Cannabigerol (CBG) has only recently been reported to prevent the progression of certain carcinomas and has not yet been studied in glioblastoma. Here, we have compared the cytotoxic, apoptotic, and anti-invasive effects of the purified natural cannabinoid CBG together with CBD and THC on established differentiated glioblastoma tumour cells and glioblastoma stem cells. CBG and THC reduced the viability of both types of cells to a similar extent, whereas combining CBD with CBG was more efficient than with THC. CBD and CBG, both alone and in combination, induced caspase-dependent cell apoptosis, and there was no additive THC effect. Of note, CBG inhibited glioblastoma invasion in a similar manner to CBD and the chemotherapeutic temozolomide. We have demonstrated that THC has little added value in combined-cannabinoid glioblastoma treatment, suggesting that this psychotropic cannabinoid should be replaced with CBG in future clinical studies of glioblastoma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33562819
"""Relationship of glioblastoma multiforme to neural stem cell regions predicts invasive and multifocal tumor phenotype.""","""Neural stem cells with astrocyte-like characteristics exist in the human brain subventricular zone (SVZ), and these cells may give rise to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We therefore analyzed MRI features of GBMs in specific relation to the SVZ. We reviewed the preoperative and serial postoperative MR images of 53 patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The spatial relationship of the contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL) with the SVZ and cortex was determined preoperatively. Classification was as follows: group I, CEL contacting SVZ and infiltrating cortex; group II, CEL contacting SVZ but not involving cortex; group III, CEL not contacting SVZ but involving cortex; and group IV, CEL neither contacting SVZ nor infiltrating cortex. Patients with group I GBMs (n = 16) were most likely to have multifocal disease at diagnosis (9 patients, 56%, p = 0.001). In contrast, group IV GBMs (n = 14) were never multifocal. Group II (n = 14) and group III (n = 9) GBMs were multifocal in 11% and 29% of cases, respectively. Group I GBMs always had tumor recurrences noncontiguous with the initial lesion(s), while group IV GBM recurrences were always bordering the primary lesion. Group I GBMs may be most related to SVZ stem cells; these tumors were in intimate contact with the SVZ, were most likely to be multifocal at diagnosis, and recurred at great distances to the initial lesion(s). In contrast, group IV GBMs were always solitary lesions; these may arise from non-SVZ, white matter glial progenitors. Our MRI-based classification of GBMs may further our understanding of GBM histogenesis and help predict tumor recurrence pattern.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17622647

High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a transcriptional modulator that mediates motility and self-renewal in normal and cancer stem cells. We identified increased expression of HMGA2 in the majority of primary human GBM tumors and cell lines compared to normal brain. Additionally, HMGA2 expression was increased in CD133+ GBM neurosphere cells compared to CD133- cells. Targeting HMGA2 with lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to decreased GBM stemness, invasion, and tumorigenicity.

Clinical data are sparse due to its limited application until now and the value of this approach for tumour control and survival time remain to be defined. Twenty-four patients (7 low-grade gliomas, 11 anaplastic gliomas, 6 glioblastomas) with brain tumours, most recurrences, were treated with SLITT, in total 30 laser procedures were performed. Under local anaesthesia a 600 micro m laser-fiber was inserted by the stereotactic-guided technique. In open low-field MR the denaturation of the tumour by a Nd-YAG-laser (1064 nm) was monitored using T 1 -weighted 3-D turbo FLASH sequences. The ablation procedure had to be stopped twice because of neurological deficit, one major infection occurred. In two cases neurological improvement was observed. Mean survival times for low grade astrocytomas, anaplastic gliomas and glioblastomas were 144 months, 39 months, 17 months, respectively. Mean survival times after SLITT were 34 months, 30 months and 9 months, respectively. Mean times to progression after SLITT for the 3 histological subgroups were 16 months, 10 months and 4 months, respectively. Five patients with low grade astrocytoma and a KI greater or equal 70 maintained a high quality functional status for 11, 20, 21, 33 and 43 months. In anaplastic tumours patients maintained a KI of 70 for a median time of 15 months and for those with glioblastoma the respective high quality duration was 7.5 months after SLITT. SLITT for selected patients with glioma could have a clinical value in a multimodality treatment schedule maintaining quality of live. Due to the minimal invasive technique, the method is a therapy of choice and may be favoured to reoperation. Major indications of this treatment are small tumours, in eloquent regions and deep seated, as well as in older patients or patients in poor functional status.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12494354
"""Intraoperative Spectroscopy with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Image-Guided Surgery of Malignant Brain Tumors.""","""Intraoperative cancer imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery have attracted considerable interest because fluorescence signals can provide real-time guidance to assist a surgeon in differentiating cancerous and normal tissues. Recent advances have led to the clinical use of a natural fluorophore called protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) for image-guided surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors (glioblastomas). However, traditional fluorescence imaging methods have only limited detection sensitivity and identification accuracy and are unable to detect low-grade or diffuse infiltrating gliomas (DIGs). Here we report a low-cost hand-held spectroscopic device that is capable of ultrasensitive detection of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence in vivo, together with intraoperative spectroscopic data obtained from both animal xenografts and human brain tumor specimens. The results indicate that intraoperative spectroscopy is at least 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current surgical microscopes, allowing ultrasensitive detection of as few as 1000 tumor cells. For detection specificity, intraoperative spectroscopy allows the differentiation of brain tumor cells from normal brain cells with a contrast signal ratio over 100. In vivo animal studies reveal that protoporphyrin IX fluorescence is strongly correlated with both MRI and histological staining, confirming that the fluorescence signals are highly specific to tumor cells. Furthermore, ex vivo spectroscopic studies of excised brain tissues demonstrate that the hand-held spectroscopic device is capable of detecting diffuse tumor margins with low fluorescence contrast that are not detectable with current systems in the operating room. These results open new opportunities for intraoperative detection and fluorescence-guided resection of microscopic and low-grade glioma brain tumors with invasive or diffusive margins.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26587976

The stimulatory effects of PGE2 and the inhibitory effects of ibuprofen (IBP) were confirmed in GBM cells. The EP2 and EP4 receptors were identified as important mediators of the actions of PGE2 in GBM cells. The concomitant inhibition of EP2 and EP4 caused a significant decrease in cell migration which was not reverted by exogenous PGE2. In T98G cells exogenous PGE2 increased latent MMP2 gelatinolytic activity. The inhibition of COX1 or COX2 caused significant alterations in MMP2 expression and gelatinolytic activity in GBM cells. These findings provide further evidence for the importance of PGE2 signalling through the EP2 and the EP4 receptor in the control of GBM cell biology.

"""Live-Cell Imaging Assays to Study Glioblastoma Brain Tumor Stem Cell Migration and Invasion.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor that is poorly controlled with the currently available treatment options. Key features of GBMs include rapid proliferation and pervasive invasion into the normal brain. Recurrence is thought to result from the presence of radio- and chemo-resistant brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) that invade away from the initial cancerous mass and, thus, evade surgical resection. Hence, therapies that target BTSCs and their invasive abilities may improve the otherwise poor prognosis of this disease. Our group and others have successfully established and characterized BTSC cultures from GBM patient samples. These BTSC cultures demonstrate fundamental cancer stem cell properties such as clonogenic self-renewal, multi-lineage differentiation, and tumor initiation in immune-deficient mice. In order to improve on the current therapeutic approaches for GBM, a better understanding of the mechanisms of BTSC migration and invasion is necessary. In GBM, the study of migration and invasion is restricted, in part, due to the limitations of existing techniques which do not fully account for the in vitro growth characteristics of BTSCs grown as neurospheres. Here, we describe rapid and quantitative live-cell imaging assays to study both the migration and invasion properties of BTSCs. The first method described is the BTSC migration assay which measures the migration toward a chemoattractant gradient. The second method described is the BTSC invasion assay which images and quantifies a cellular invasion from neurospheres into a matrix.

Here we present the morphological and genetic characterization of a novel glioblastoma in vivo model and provide evidence that treatment with an antibody targeting TF leads to reduced glioma cell invasiveness. Therefore, we established a murine xenograft treatment model by transplanting the angiogenic and diffusely infiltrating human glioma cell line MZ-18 with endogenous TF expression into nude mice brains and treating these mice with an intracranial osmotic pump system continuously infusing a monoclonal antibody against TF (mAb TF9-10H10). The human MZ-18 cell line harbors two TP53 mutations resulting in a strong nuclear accumulation of p53, thereby facilitating the unambiguous identification of tumor cells in the xenograft model. Intracranial application of TF9-10H10 significantly reduced invasion of MZ-18 cells compared to mock-treated control animals. The extent of activated blood vessels was also reduced upon anti-TF treatment.

"""Inhibition of glioblastoma angiogenesis and invasion by combined treatments directed against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial-cadherin.""","""Purpose: Inhibition of angiogenesis can influence tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We previously showed that blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with the monoclonal antibody DC101 inhibited intracerebral glioblastoma growth but caused increased tumor cell invasion along the preexistent vasculature. In the present study, we attempted to inhibit glioma cell invasion using a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which in the context of human glioblastomas, has been implicated in tumor cell invasion. In addition, we analyzed whether blockade of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin as a different antiangiogenic target could also inhibit glioblastoma angiogenesis and growth. Experimental designs: Nude mice who received intracerebral glioblastoma xenografts were treated using monoclonal antibodies against VEGFR-2 (DC101), EGFR (C225), and VE-cadherin (E4G10) either alone or in different combinations. Results: Increased tumor cell invasion provoked by DC101 monotherapy was inhibited by 50% to 66% by combined treatment with C225 and DC101. C225 inhibited glioblastoma cell migration in vitro, but had no effect on the volume of the main tumor mass or on tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis in vivo, either alone or in combination with DC101. The anti-VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody E4G10 was a weaker inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and growth than DC101, and also caused a weaker increase in tumor cell invasion. Conclusions: Inhibition of angiogenesis achieved by blocking either VEGFR-2 or VE-cadherin can cause increased glioma cell invasion in an orthotopic model. Increased tumor cell invasion induced by potent inhibition of angiogenesis with DC101 could be inhibited by simultaneous blockade of EGFR.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16000592

Wound-healing and transwell assays showed that TTF suppressed cell migration and invasion compared with controls. Soft agar and three-dimensional culture assays showed that TTF inhibited both anchorage-dependent (cell proliferation) and anchorage-independent (colony formation) GBM cell growth. TTF dysregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related genes, such as vimentin and E-cadherin, which partially accounted for TTF inhibition of cell migration and invasion. We further demonstrated that TTF application suppressed angiogenesis by downregulating VEGF, HIF1Î± and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. TTF also inhibited NF-kB transcriptional activity.

In this study, we reveal that HNRNPK-SUMO1 expression is predominantly found in the GBM infiltration area. SUMOylation of the K422 residue of HNRNPK interferes with its DNA binding ability, thereby disrupting downstream transcription, and ultimately leading to transitions between different states of glioblastoma stem cells.

Immunotherapy has been becoming a promising strategy to treat diverse cancers. It has been known that there are highly heterogeneous immunosuppressive microenvironments among different GBM molecular subtypes that mainly include classical (CL), mesenchymal (MES), and proneural (PN), respectively. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of immune landscapes among them is essential for identifying novel immune markers of GBM. Methods and results: In the present study, based on collecting the largest number of 109 immune signatures, we aim to achieve a precise diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy prediction for GBM by performing a comprehensive immunogenomic analysis. Firstly, machine-learning (ML) methods were proposed to evaluate the diagnostic values of these immune signatures, and the optimal classifier was constructed for accurate recognition of three GBM subtypes with robust and promising performance. The prognostic values of these signatures were then confirmed, and a risk score was established to divide all GBM patients into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups with a high predictive accuracy for overall survival (OS). Therefore, complete differential analysis across GBM subtypes was performed in terms of the immune characteristics along with clinicopathological and molecular features, which indicates that MES shows much higher immune heterogeneity compared to CL and PN but has significantly better immunotherapy responses, although MES patients may have an immunosuppressive microenvironment and be more proinflammatory and invasive. Finally, the MES subtype is proved to be more sensitive to 17-AAG, docetaxel, and erlotinib using drug sensitivity analysis and three compounds of AS-703026, PD-0325901, and MEK1-2-inhibitor might be potential therapeutic agents.

"""Gefitinib selectively inhibits tumor cell migration in EGFR-amplified human glioblastoma.""","""Background: Tissue invasion is a hallmark of most human cancers and remains a major source of treatment failure in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Although EGFR amplification has been previously associated with more invasive tumor behavior, existing experimental models have not supported quantitative evaluation of interpatient differences in tumor cell migration or testing of patient-specific responses to therapies targeting invasion. To explore these questions, we optimized an ex vivo organotypic slice culture system allowing for labeling and tracking of tumor cells in human GBM slice cultures. Methods: With use of time-lapse confocal microscopy of retrovirally labeled tumor cells in slices, baseline differences in migration speed and efficiency were determined and correlated with EGFR amplification in a cohort of patients with GBM. Slices were treated with gefitinib to evaluate anti-invasive effects associated with targeting EGFR. Results: Migration analysis identified significant patient-to-patient variation at baseline. EGFR amplification was correlated with increased migration speed and efficiency compared with nonamplified tumors. Critically, gefitinib resulted in a selective and significant reduction of tumor cell migration in EGFR-amplified tumors. Conclusions: These data provide the first identification of patient-to-patient variation in tumor cell migration in living human tumor tissue. We found that EGFR-amplified GBM are inherently more efficient in their migration and can be effectively targeted by gefitinib treatment. These data suggest that stratified clinical trails are needed to evaluate gefitinib as an anti-invasive adjuvant for patients with EGFR-amplified GBM. In addition, these results provide proof of principle that primary slice cultures may be useful for patient-specific screening of agents designed to inhibit tumor invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23749785
"""Dynamics of chemosensitivity and chromosomal instability in recurrent glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is characterised by invasive growth and frequent recurrence. Here, we have analysed chromosomal changes in comparison to tumour cell aggressiveness and chemosensitivity of three cell lines established from a primary tumour and consecutive recurrences (BTL1 to BTL3) of a long-term surviving glioblastoma patient together with paraffin-embedded materials of five further cases with recurrent disease. Following surgery, the BTL patient progressed under irradiation/ lomustine but responded to temozolomide after re-operation to temozolomide. The primary tumour -derived BTL1 cells showed chromosomal imbalances typical of highly aggressive glioblastomas. Interestingly, BTL2 cells established from the first recurrence developed under therapy showed signs of enhanced chromosomal instability. In contrast, BTL3 cells from the second recurrence resembled a less aggressive subclone of the primary tumour. Although BTL2 cells exhibited a highly aggressive phenotype, BTL3 cells were characterised by reduced proliferative and migratory potential. Despite persistent methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter, BTL3 cells exhibited the highest temozolomide sensitivity. A comparable situation was found in two out of five glioblastoma patients, both characterised by enhanced survival time, who also relapsed after surgery/chemotherapy with less aggressive recurrences. Taken together, our data suggest that pretreated glioblastoma patients may relapse with highly chemosensitive tumours confirming the feasibility of temozolomide treatment even in case of repeated recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342095
"""Roles of Kunitz domains in the anti-invasive effect of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 in human glioblastoma cells.""","""Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) is a membrane-bound serine proteinase inhibitor having two extracellular Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains (KD) namely KD-1 and KD-2. It efficiently inhibits hepatocyte growth factor activator, matriptase, hepsin, prostasin and trypsin. We have previously reported that the expression of HAI-1 suppresses the in vitro invasive capability of human glioblastoma cells. In this study we examined the role of each KD in the anti-invasive effect of HAI-1. Engineered over-expression of the mature membrane-form HAI-1 suppressed in vitro fibrin gel invasion of two human glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and YKG-1. The migratory activity on type IV collagen was also suppressed by the HAI-1 expression. These effects were not affected by the deletion of intracytoplasmic domain of HAI-1. A truncated secreted form of HAI-1 also suppressed in vitro invasion of the cells, indicating that the extracellular portion of HAI-1 was responsible for the anti-invasive effect. To determine the roles of each KD in the anti-invasive effect of HAI-1 in vitro, we constructed expression plasmids for HAI-1 with or without mutation at the P1 position of the reactive site of each KD. The results revealed that the proteinase inhibitor activity of N-terminal KD (KD-1) is responsible for the anti-invasion effect of HAI-1.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17949349
"""CCR5-Mediated Signaling Is Involved in Invasion of Glioblastoma Cells in Its Microenvironment.""","""The chemokine CCL5/RANTES is a versatile inflammatory mediator, which interacts with the receptor CCR5, promoting cancer cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma is a highly invasive tumor, in which CCL5 expression correlates with shorter patient survival. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified CCL5 and CCR5 in a series of glioblastoma samples and cells, including glioblastoma stem cells. CCL5 and CCR5 gene expression were significantly higher in a cohort of 38 glioblastoma samples, compared to low-grade glioma and non-cancerous tissues. The in vitro invasion of patients-derived primary glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma stem cells was dependent on CCL5-induced CCR5 signaling and is strongly inhibited by the small molecule CCR5 antagonist maraviroc. Invasion of these cells, which was enhanced when co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), was inhibited by maraviroc, suggesting that MSCs release CCR5 ligands. In support of this model, we detected CCL5 and CCR5 in MSC monocultures and glioblastoma-associated MSC in tissue sections. We also found CCR5 expressing macrophages were in close proximity to glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, autocrine and paracrine cross-talk in glioblastoma and, in particular, glioblastoma stem cells with its stromal microenvironment, involves CCR5 and CCL5, contributing to glioblastoma invasion, suggesting the CCL5/CCR5 axis as a potential therapeutic target that can be targeted with repositioned drug maraviroc.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32545571
"""CacyBP/SIP inhibits the migration and invasion behaviors of glioblastoma cells through activating Siah1 mediated ubiquitination and degradation of cytoplasmic p27.""","""Calcyclin-binding protein or Siah-1-interacting protein (CacyBP/SIP) has been reported to be up-regulated and plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation in human glioma. However, the effect of CacyBP/SIP on glioma cell motility is still unclear. Here, to our surprise, CacyBP/SIP was found to inhibit the migration and invasion of glioma cells U251 and U87. Silencing of CacyBP/SIP significantly promoted the migration and invasion behaviors of glioma cells. On the contrary, overexpression of CacyBP/SIP obviously suppressed them. Further investigation indicated that silencing of CacyBP/SIP significantly reduced the interaction between Siah1 and cytoplasmic p27, which in turn attenuated the ubiquitination and degradation of cytoplasmic p27. In contrast, overexpression of CacyBP/SIP promoted the interaction between Siah1 and cytoplasmic p27, which in turn increased the ubiquitination and degradation of cytoplasmic p27. Importantly, the degradation of p27 could be blocked by Siah1 knockdown. Finally, we found that CacyBP/SIP was reversely related to cytoplasmic p27 in human normal brain tissues and glioma tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that CacyBP/SIP plays an important role in inhibiting glioma cell migration and invasion through promoting the degradation of cytoplasmic p27.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29024247

Methods: HMGB2 protein levels were measured in 51 GBM patients by immunohistochemical studies. To clarify the precise role of HMGB2 on cell invasion and viability of 3 GBM cell lines, we did in vitro and in vivo analyses with lentivirus vectors and small interfering RNA. Transwell invasion assays and wound-healing assays were used to analyze the invasion of GBM cells. Expression of p53 and matrix metalloproteinase 2/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2/TIMP2) protein was analyzed by Western blot. Results: HMGB2 protein expression was significantly higher in GBM than in controlled brain tissues (P < .0001). HMGB2 overexpression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival time, which was the only independent prognostic factor for overall survival in a multivariate analysis (P = .017). HMGB2 knockdown by small interfering RNA decreased cell viability and invasion in vitro and significantly decreased tumor volume in vivo, which might be involved in the change of p53 expression and the balance of MMP2/TIMP2. Moreover, silencing of HMGB2 could significantly increase the sensitivity of GBM cells to temozolomide chemotherapy. Conclusions: Our present data suggest that HMGB2 expression is a significant prognostic factor and might play an important role in cell invasion and temozolomide-induced chemotherapeutic sensitivity of GBM. This study highlights the importance of HMGB2 as a novel prognostic marker and an attractive therapeutic target of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23828241

In this study, real-time PCR results showed that the level of miR-375 expression in GBM tissues and GBM cell lines (U87 and U251) was decreased. Using MTT assay, Transwell migration and invasion assay, we demonstrated that miR-375 overexpression significantly suppress cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion capacity in U87 and U251 cells.

Juglone induced C6 cell death with EC50 concentrations equal to 10.4 Â± 1.6 ÂµM after 24h incubation. At relatively low concentrations juglone significantly decreased cell proliferation, reduced spheroid invasiveness and suppressed 'wound' healing. In addition, generation of intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RS) was detected in cells treated with juglone. Noteworthy, juglone was relatively stable in cell culture medium and levels of H2O2 generated from juglone due to its probable reaction with medium components were not sufficient to affect the viability of glioma cells. Moreover, addition of catalase to the cell medium did not reduce the cytotoxicity of juglone. Therefore, we propose that cell death may be induced through the action of RS other than H2O2, However the direct effect of juglone on the cellular targets could not be excluded either.

Diffuse infiltration of GSCs facilitates tumor progression and frustrates efforts at effective treatment. Further compounding this situation is the currently limited understanding of what drives GSC invasion. Here we comprehensively evaluated the significance of a novel invasion-related protein, Family with Sequence Similarity 129 Member A (FAM129A), in infiltrative GSCs. Methods: Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analysis were used to quantify FAM129A in glioma specimens and cancer datasets. Overexpression and knockdown of FAM129A in GSCs were used to investigate its effects on tumor growth and invasion. RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and co-precipitation assays were used to investigate FAM129A signaling mechanisms. Results: FAM129A is preferentially expressed in invasive frontiers. Targeting FAM129A impairs GSC invasion and self-renewal.

Studies of nonglioma cell lines have demonstrated that WT1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, this ability has not been rigorously analyzed in human GBM. Methods: The authors tested the efficacy of 2 sequences of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against WT1 in U251MG human GBM cells and found that 1 sequence was capable of stably silencing WT1 expression. They then evaluated the effect of WT1 silencing on cellular proliferation, invasion, and in vivo tumor formation. Results: Stable WT1-shRNA expression significantly decreased the proliferation of U251MG cells in vitro as demonstrated by both an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-based viability assay and tritiated thymidine uptake. Furthermore, stable WT1 silencing caused significantly slower growth after the subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells in the flanks of athymic nude mice and was associated with an increased latency period.

Intracellular iron concentrations were modulated by applying desferrioxamine (DFO) and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). We detected enhanced invasion of glioblastoma cells upon DFO-induced iron depletion. Treatment of cells with FAC strongly inhibited invasion. DFO treatment resulted in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1)-mediated induction of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and matrix metalloproteinase 2. Further, RNA interference-mediated repression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor inhibited DFO-induced invasion.

"""ODZ1 allows glioblastoma to sustain invasiveness through a Myc-dependent transcriptional upregulation of RhoA.""","""Long-term survival remains low for most patients with glioblastoma (GBM), which reveals the need for markers of disease outcome and novel therapeutic targets. We describe that ODZ1 (also known as TENM1), a type II transmembrane protein involved in fetal brain development, plays a crucial role in the invasion of GBM cells. Differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells drives the nuclear translocation of an intracellular fragment of ODZ1 through proteolytic cleavage by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a. The intracellular fragment of ODZ1 promotes cytoskeletal remodelling of GBM cells and invasion of the surrounding environment both in vitro and in vivo. Absence of ODZ1 by gene deletion or downregulation of ODZ1 by small interfering RNAs drastically reduces the invasive capacity of GBM cells. This activity is mediated by an ODZ1-triggered transcriptional pathway, through the E-box binding Myc protein, that promotes the expression and activation of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and subsequent activation of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). Overexpression of ODZ1 in GBM cells reduced survival of xenografted mice. Consistently, analysis of 122 GBM tumour samples revealed that the number of ODZ1-positive cells inversely correlated with overall and progression-free survival.

Tumor enrichment pathways and immune infiltrates were explored by single-cell RNA sequencing and TIMER. Loxl1-related changes in tumor viability/proliferation and invasion were further validated by CCK-8, western blot, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays.

"""Immunotherapy for glioblastoma: on the sidelines or in the game?""","""The successful eradication of multiple tumor types, often in a durable manner, has recently validated the bona fide potential of an effectively mobilized immune response as a cancer therapy. Critical questions at present, therefore, include deciphering why some patients respond while others do not, as well as why certain cancers respond while others like glioblastoma do not. Glioblastoma remains a major unmet need in medical oncology and is considered incurable with less than 10% of patients surviving five years from diagnosis. Hallmark phenotypic features of glioblastoma including aberrantly activated cell proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance are linked with multiple adaptive and supportive mechanisms culminating in formidable heterogeneity across and within individual tumors. Similarly, the complex adaptive abilities of glioblastoma tumors to abrogate anti-tumor immune responses are multifaceted yet integrated. Not unexpectedly, results of recent advanced clinical trials with single-agent immunotherapeutics for glioblastoma have been negative although some early stage studies and anecdotal cases have generated encouraging results. The application of immunotherapies for glioblastoma currently finds itself therefore at a pivotal crossroads. Critical to mapping a path forward will be the systematic characterization of the immunobiology of glioblastoma tumors utilizing currently available, state of the art technologies. Therapeutic approaches aimed at driving effector immune cells into the glioblastoma microenvironment as well as overcoming immunosuppressive myeloid cells, physical factors, and cytokines, as well as limiting the potentially detrimental, iatrogenic impact of dexamethasone, will likely be required for the potential of anti-tumor immune responses to be realized for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29278673

Additionally, the response to drug treatments of three different culture models was compared with regard to the type of cell death.Multi-gene expression profiling revealed differences between examined culture types with regard to the expression pattern of the selected genes. Functionally, the examined genes were related to drug resistance and metabolism, DNA damage and repair and cell cycle control, and included potential therapeutic targets.Cytotoxicity analyses confirmed that environmental factors can influence not only the molecular background of glioblastoma drug-resistance and efficiency of treatment, but also the mechanisms/pathways of cell death, which was reflected by a distinct intensification of apoptosis and autophagy observed in particular culture models.

MiR-1271 and CaMKK2 expression were quantified in normal human astrocyte cells, GBM cell lines, and low- and high-grade glioma tissues. MKI67 expression in GBM cells was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The target relationship between miR-1271 and the CAMKK2 gene was confirmed using the luciferase reporter assay. MTT and Transwell assays were used to analyze the role of miR-1271 and CAMKK2 in cell proliferation and invasion. Finally, CaMKK2 expression and AKT phosphorylation were detected by western blotting. MiR-1271 was significantly downregulated in high-grade glioma tissues and GBM cell lines. Conversely, CAMKK2 mRNA expression was upregulated in high-grade glioma tissues and GBM cell lines. We observed that miR-1271 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of CAMKK2, indicating an inverse relationship with miR-1271. Overexpressing miR-1271 inhibited GBM cell proliferation and invasion, whereas inhibiting miR-1271 increased cell proliferation and invasion. Silencing CAMKK2 expression also inhibited GBM cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, overexpressing miR-1271 inhibited AKT phosphorylation and MKI67 mRNA expression by targeting CAMKK2. These results indicate that miR-1271 regulates GBM cell proliferation and invasion, and that these effects involve directly targeting the CAMKK2 gene. Therefore, miR-1271 may serve as a new therapeutic target for developing GBM treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791096
"""Significance of liquid biopsy in glioblastoma - A review.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor with a 16-24 -months overall survival time (OS). Effective management is hindered by intratumoral heterogeneity, a characteristic trait of GBM which results in subpopulations of cells with altered therapeutic responsiveness, different invasiveness and growth potential. Correct initial molecular profiling of the tumor, as well as following its molecular biological changes are further impeded by the intracranial location of the tumors, hence the risks of surgical interventions. Radiological examination, the sole non-invasive method of obtaining information about the tumors, also has limitations. This review article aims to summarize the currently available information about the promising applicability of liquid biopsy, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cf-NAs) in GBM patients. Liquid biopsy is a quick and inexpensive way of obtaining exceptionally relevant information about tumors, and can be performed multiple times during the clinical course of the disease. Furthermore, integrating analyses of EVs and related cf-NAs in clinical practice might also help to establish diagnosis in a non-invasive manner, and complex oncotherapy could be indicated in the future without high-risk neurosurgical interventions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986516
"""Glioblastoma microenvironment contains multiple hormonal and non-hormonal growth-stimulating factors.""","""Background: The growth of malignant tumors is influenced by their microenvironment. Glioblastoma, an aggressive primary brain tumor, may have cysts containing fluid that represents the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the cyst fluid of cystic glioblastomas contains growth-stimulating factors. Identification of such growth factors may pave the way for the development of targeted anti-glioblastoma therapies. Methods: We performed hormone analysis of cyst fluid from 25 cystic glioblastomas and proteomics analysis of cyst fluid from another 12 cystic glioblastomas. Results: Glioblastoma cyst fluid contained hormones within wide concentration ranges: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (0-13.7 nmol/L), insulin (1.4-133 pmol/L), erythropoietin (4.7-402 IU/L), growth hormone (0-0.93 Âµg/L), testosterone (0.2-10.1 nmol/L), estradiol (0-1.0 nmol/L), triiodothyronine (1.0-11.5). Tumor volume correlated with cyst fluid concentrations of growth hormone and testosterone. Survival correlated inversely with cyst fluid concentration of erythropoietin. Several hormones were present at concentrations that have been shown to stimulate glioblastoma growth in vitro. Concentrations of erythropoietin and estradiol (in men) were higher in cyst fluid than in serum, suggesting formation by tumor or brain tissue. Quantitatively, glioblastoma cyst fluid was dominated by serum proteins, illustrating blood-brain barrier leakage. Proteomics identified several proteins that stimulate tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness, others that inhibit apoptosis or mediate adaption to hypoxia and some that induce neovascularization or blood-brain barrier leakage. Conclusion: The microenvironment of glioblastomas is rich in growth-stimulating factors that may originate from the circulation, the tumor, or the brain. The wide variation in cyst fluid hormone concentrations may differentially influence tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35659255
"""Study on the Inhibitory Effect of Curcumin on GBM and Its Potential Mechanism.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). However, current GBM treatments are ineffective, signifying the great importance of exploring new therapeutic targets. Curcumin has been found to be a natural compound with an anticancer potential. However, its targets and mechanisms in GBM are still unclear. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from the GBM dataset in the GEO database and intersected with the target genes of curcumin to select potential target genes. Subsequently, survival analysis was performed with the GEPIA database to confirm the effect of target genes on the prognosis of GBM, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID database. In vitro, CCK-8 assay was used to screen the appropriate concentration of curcumin; scratch and transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate the effect of curcumin on the migration and invasion abilities of GBM cells. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to detect changes in target genes and flow cytometry was used to assess the apoptosis level. Results: A total of 16 target genes of curcumin and GBM were obtained, among which ENO1, MMP2, and PRKD2 significantly affected the prognosis (P < 0.05). We further selected ENO1 for functional enrichment analysis and found that it was enriched in the glycolytic pathway. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments showed that curcumin could inhibit the migration and invasion of U251 cells and promote apoptosis (P < 0.05).

"""circRNA derived from CLSPN (circCLSPN) is an oncogene in human glioblastoma multiforme by regulating cell growth, migration and invasion via ceRNA pathway.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and prevalent brain tumor in adults. The circRNA derived from CLSPN (hsa_circ_0011591, circCLSPN) is remarkably upregulated in GBM; however its functional role was uncovered yet. First, we examined expression of circCLSPN using GSE109569 database and RT-qPCR, and circCLSPN level was upregulated in human GBM tumor tissues and cells (A172 and LN18); moreover, circCLSPN showed a stable structure stability. Then, a series of loss-of-functional experiments were performed using CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, scratch wound assay, and transwell assay. Consequently, circCLSPN silencing suppressed cell viability, colony formation ability, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion of A172 and LN18 cells in vitro, and promoted apoptosis rate. Allied with those were decreased B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP9 expression, and elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) level. According to dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay, miR-370-3p was identified to be targeted and sponged by circCLSPN, and further targeted and negatively regulated USP39. Functionally, overexpressing miR-370-3p could mimic in vitro effects of circCLSPN interference. Rescue experiments revealed that blocking miR-370-3p could partially reverse the suppression of circCLSPN knockdown on cell growth, migration and invasion, and role of miR- 370-3p overexpression was abrogated by restoring USP39. In vivo, circCLSPN knockdown hindered tumor growth of LN18 cells by affecting miR-370-3p, USP39, MMP2 and MMP9 expression.

"""Expression analysis of the autosomal recessive primary microcephaly genes MCPH1 (microcephalin) and MCPH5 (ASPM, abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly associated) in human malignant gliomas.""","""Patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly have a small but architecturally normal brain containing a reduced number of neurons. Microcephalin and ASPM are two of the genes causing this disease. Both are centrosomal proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. Whereas microcephalin is a component of the DNA damage response and a repressor of telomerase function, ASPM is required for the proper formation of a central mitotic spindle and ensures symmetric, proliferative divisions of neuro-epithelial cells. Both proteins are also involved in the regulation of tumor growth. Microcephalin expression is reduced in breast cancer cell lines and human tumors of the ovary and prostate. Reduction in microcephalin mRNA expression correlates with increased chromosomal instability. ASPM mRNA is overexpressed in transformed human cell lines and tumors, and its increased expression is positively associated with proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Glioblastomas are the most prevalent malignant brain tumors in adults, characterized by increased invasiveness, an aggressive local growth pattern and short survival periods of patients. In this study, we analysed the expression of microcephalin mRNA and ASPM mRNA and protein in a panel of 15 glioblastomas and 15 astrocytoma WHO grade II by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Whereas microcephalin expression did not seem to be altered during glioma development, there was a clear increase in ASPM mRNA and protein expression that corresponded with the WHO grade of the tumor.

"""Regulators of G-protein signaling 3 and 4 (RGS3, RGS4) are associated with glioma cell motility.""","""Diffuse brain invasion is a major reason for poor prognosis of glioma patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying infiltration are different from those of other cancer types. To detect genes associated with glioma invasion, highly migratory clones were selected from U373MG glioma cells and from primary glioblastoma cells, and the gene expression pattern of these 'fast' cells was compared with that of the original ('slow') cells using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising 12,625 genes. A total of 28 genes were differently expressed in both primary and established cell populations, including 19 genes that were upregulated and 9 that were downregulated in fast cells. Most of these genes have not been linked to glioma invasion so far. Specifically, differentially expressed genes included those encoding extracellular matrix components (COL16A1, DPT), proteases (CATD, PRSS11), cytokines (MDK, IL8), transport proteins (SLC1A3, ATP10B), cytoskeleton constituents (ACTA2, ACTSG, NEFL), DNA repair enzymes (WRN, ADPRTL2), and G-protein signaling components (GNA12, RGS3, RGS4). RGS3 and RGS4, which are homologs of the Drosophila glia gene loco, were further functionally analyzed. U373MG glioma cell clones overexpressing RGS3 or RGS4 showed an increase of both adhesion and migration.

"""PEA-15 inhibits tumor cell invasion by binding to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2.""","""Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) binds to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases to alter ERK1/2 cellular localization and target preferences and binds to adaptors in the extrinsic cell death pathway to block apoptosis. Here, we report that PEA-15 protein expression is inversely correlated with the invasive behavior of breast cancer in an immunohistochemical analysis of a breast cancer progression tissue microarray. Short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of PEA-15 expression increased the invasion of PEA-15-expressing tumor cells in vitro, suggesting a causative role for PEA-15 in the inhibition of invasion. This causative role was confirmed by the finding that the enforced expression of PEA-15 in invasive tumor cells reduced invasion. The effect of PEA-15 on tumor invasion is mediated by its interaction with ERK1/2 as shown by the following: (a) PEA-15 mutants that fail to bind ERK1/2 did not inhibit invasion; (b) overexpression of ERK1 or activated MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) reversed the inhibitory effect of PEA-15; (c) when an inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation reduced invasion, PEA-15 expression did not significantly reduce invasion further. Furthermore, we find that the effect of PEA-15 on invasion seems to relate to the nuclear localization of activated ERK1/2. PEA-15 inhibits invasion by keeping ERK out of the nucleus, as a PEA-15 mutant that cannot prevent ERK nuclear localization was not able to inhibit invasion. In addition, membrane-localized ERK1, which sequesters endogenous ERK1 to prevent its nuclear localization, also inhibited invasion. These results reveal that PEA-15 regulates cancer cell invasion via its ability to bind ERK1/2 and indicate that nuclear entry of ERK1/2 is important in tumor behavior.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17308092

We systematically characterized miRNA expression and editing in the human brain, which displays the highest number of A-to-I RNA editing sites among human tissues, and in de novo glioblastoma brain cancer. We identified 299 miRNAs altered in their expression and 24 miRNAs differently edited in human brain compared to glioblastoma tissues. We focused on the editing site within the miR-589-3p seed. MiR-589-3p is a unique miRNA almost fully edited (â¼100%) in normal brain and with a consistent editing decrease in glioblastoma. The edited version of miR-589-3p inhibits glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while the unedited version boosts cell proliferation and motility/invasion, thus being a potential cancer-promoting factor. We demonstrated that the editing of this miRNA is mediated by ADAR2, and retargets miR-589-3p from the tumor-suppressor PCDH9 to ADAM12, which codes for the metalloproteinase 12 promoting glioblastoma invasion. Overall, our study dissects the role of a unique brain-specific editing site within miR-589-3p, with important anticancer features, and highlights the importance of RNA editing as an essential player not only for diversifying the genomic message but also for correcting not-tolerable/critical genomic coding sites.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29267965

Here, we reported that cells exposure to 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), a P2X7R agonist, up-regulated the expression of markers associated to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process likely contributing to GSC malignancy, and increased GSC migration/invasiveness like the known EMT inducer, Transforming Growth Factor Î²1 (TGFÎ²1). These effects were coupled to phosphorylation of SMAD2, a downstream effector in the TGFÎ² pathway, suggesting its involvement in P2X7R-mediated activity in GSCs. All BzATP effects, including a decrease in the caspase 3/7 activity in GSC medium, were mostly counteracted by the P2X7R antagonist A438079. Finally, BzATP increased the subunit expression of two main human P2X7R splice variants, the full-length P2X7A and the truncated P2X7B, lacking the carboxylic tail, which have different functional properties depending on their arrangement. Since up-regulation of A/B subunits might favor their assembly into a heterotrimeric P2X7R with great sensitivity towards agonists and cell energy support, this is in line with increased EMT markers expression, cell migration/invasion and GSC survival observed following P2X7R stimulation. As in GBM microenvironment extracellular ATP levels may activate P2X7R, our data suggest a P2X7R role in GBM recurrence/invasiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905754

Methods: In the present work, we analyzed the clonal evolution of these major EGFR aberrations in a small cohort of GBM patients using a unique surgical multisampling technique. Furthermore, we overexpressed both receptors separately and together in 2 patient-derived GBM stem cell lines (GSCs) to analyze their functions in vivo in orthotopic xenograft models. Results: In human GBM biopsies, we identified EGFR amplification as an early event because EGFRvIII mutations emerge from intratumoral heterogeneity later in tumor development. To investigate the biological relevance of this distinct developmental pattern, we established experimental model systems. In these models, EGFR+ tumor cells showed activation of classical downstream signaling pathways upon EGF stimulation and displayed enhanced invasive growth without evidence of angiogenesis in vivo. In contrast, EGFRvIII+ tumors were driven by activation of the prototypical Src family kinase c-Src that promoted VEGF secretion leading to angiogenic tumor growth. Conclusions: The presented work shows that sequential EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII mutations might represent concerted evolutionary events that drive the aggressive nature of GBM by promoting invasion and angiogenesis via distinct signaling pathways. In particular, c-SRC may be an attractive therapeutic target for tumors harboring EGFRvIII as we identified this protein specifically mediating angiogenic tumor growth downstream of EGFRvIII.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27286795

Median survival after treatment is around 15 months. Remodeling of N-glycans by the N-acetylglucosamine glycosyltransferase (MGAT5) regulates tumoral development. Here, perturbation of MGAT5 enzymatic activity by the small-molecule inhibitor 3-hydroxy-4,5-bis-benzyloxy-6-benzyloxymethyl-2-phenyl2-oxo-2Î»5-[1,2]oxaphosphinane (PST3.1a) restrains GBM growth. In cell-based assays, it is demonstrated that PST3.1a alters the Î²1,6-GlcNAc N-glycans of GBM-initiating cells (GIC) by inhibiting MGAT5 enzymatic activity, resulting in the inhibition of TGFÎ²R and FAK signaling associated with doublecortin (DCX) upregulation and increase oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) expression. PST3.1a thus affects microtubule and microfilament integrity of GBM stem cells, leading to the inhibition of GIC proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and clonogenic capacities. Orthotopic graft models of GIC revealed that PST3.1a treatment leads to a drastic reduction of invasive and proliferative capacity and to an increase in overall survival relative to standard temozolomide therapy. Finally, bioinformatics analyses exposed that PST3.1a cytotoxic activity is positively correlated with the expression of genes of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while the expression of mitochondrial genes correlated negatively with cell sensitivity to the compound.

Emerging evidence suggests a link between impaired A-to-I editing and cancer, particularly in high-grade gliomas. We hypothesized that disruption of A-to-I editing alters expression of genes regulating glioma tumor phenotypes. By sequencing the miR-376 cluster, we show that the overall miRNA editing frequencies were reduced in human gliomas. Specifically in high-grade gliomas, miR-376a* accumulated entirely in an unedited form. Clinically, a significant correlation was found between accumulation of unedited miR-376a* and the extent of invasive tumor spread as measured by magnetic resonance imaging of patient brains. Using both in vitro and orthotopic xenograft mouse models, we demonstrated that the unedited miR-376a* promoted glioma cell migration and invasion, while the edited miR-376a* suppressed these features. The effects of the unedited miR-376a* were mediated by its sequence-dependent ability to target RAP2A and concomitant inability to target AMFR. Thus, the tumor-dependent introduction of a single base difference in the miR-376a* sequence dramatically alters the selection of its target genes and redirects its function from inhibiting to promoting glioma cell invasion. These findings uncover a new mechanism of miRNA deregulation and identify unedited miR-376a* as a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23093778

The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the inhibition of tumor formation is due to apoptosis. Apoptosis is a highly conserved cell suicide program essential for development and tissue homeostasis of all metazoan organisms. Key to the apoptotic program is a family of cystein proteases termed caspases, which are important for execution of apoptosis by cleavage of essential cellular proteins. We found loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and subsequent activation of Caspase-9 in SNB 19 AS-uPAR cells compared to parental and vector controls.

"""For the next trick: new discoveries in radiobiology applied to glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Radiotherapy post surgical resection remained the mainstay of the management of GBM for decades until the addition of temozolomide was shown to prolong the median overall survival (OS) by 2.5 months to 14.6 months in 2005. Infiltrative growth to surrounding normal brain tissue and cooption of vascular niches, peripheral microvasuclar hyperplasia, and central hypoxic regions with pseudopalisading necrosis are characteristics of GBM and are causally linked to their exceptional radio- and chemo-resistant phenotype. An intratumoral hierarchy is postulated consisting of tumor stem cells in the apex with high DNA-repair proficiency resisting radiotherapy. It is conceivable that the stem cell property is more dynamic than originally anticipated. Niche effects such as exposure to hypoxia and intercellular communication in proximities to endothelial or bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC), for example, may activate such 'stem cell' programs. GBM are exceptionally stroma-rich tumors and may consist of more than 70% stroma components, such as microglia and BMDC. It becomes increasingly apparent that treatment of GBM needs to integrate therapies targeting all above-mentioned distinct pathophysiological features. Accordingly, recent approaches in GBM therapy include inhibition of invasion (e.g., integrin, EGFR, CD95, and mTOR inhibition), antiangiogenesis and stroma modulators (TGFbeta, VEGF, angiopoetin, cMET inhibitors) and activation of immune response (vaccination and blockage of negative co-stimulatory signals). In addition, high LET-radiotherapy, for example with carbon ions, is postulated to ablate tumor stem cell and hypoxic cells more efficiently as compared with conventional low-LET photon irradiation. We discuss current key concepts, their limitations, and potentials to improve the outcome in this rapidly progressive and devastating disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24857153
"""Speed Switch in Glioblastoma Growth Rate due to Enhanced Hypoxia-Induced Migration.""","""We analyze the wave speed of the Proliferation Invasion Hypoxia Necrosis Angiogenesis (PIHNA) model that was previously created and applied to simulate the growth and spread of glioblastoma (GBM), a particularly aggressive primary brain tumor. We extend the PIHNA model by allowing for different hypoxic and normoxic cell migration rates and study the impact of these differences on the wave-speed dynamics. Through this analysis, we find key variables that drive the outward growth of the simulated GBM. We find a minimum tumor wave-speed for the model; this depends on the migration and proliferation rates of the normoxic cells and is achieved under certain conditions on the migration rates of the normoxic and hypoxic cells. If the hypoxic cell migration rate is greater than the normoxic cell migration rate above a threshold, the wave speed increases above the predicted minimum. This increase in wave speed is explored through an eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis of the linearized PIHNA model, which yields an expression for this threshold. The PIHNA model suggests that an inherently faster-diffusing hypoxic cell population can drive the outward growth of a GBM as a whole, and that this effect is more prominent for faster-proliferating tumors that recover relatively slowly from a hypoxic phenotype. The findings presented here act as a first step in enabling patient-specific calibration of the PIHNA model.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180054

We previously reported a remarkable antitumoral effect of the retinoid 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenantrene (IIF) on neuroblastoma, leukemia and colon carcinoma cells. In this study we examined the effect of IIF on proliferation, apoptosis and cell invasion in the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG, in comparison with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Our results showed that both retinoids induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that the invasive ability of glioblastoma cells decreased after treatment with IIF or RA. Since cell invasion involves a complex system of tightly regulated proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), we analysed the effect of IIF on MMP and TIMP expression in comparison with RA. Treatment with both retinoids resulted in a marked decrease of MMP2 and MMP9 expression and of lytic activity of MMP2. In addition, exposure to IIF led to enhanced expression of TIMP2. Collectively, our results demonstrated the effectiveness of both IIF and RA in inhibiting proliferation, cell migration, and the invasive potential of glioblastoma U87MG cells. Notably, the anticancer activity of IIF, on the whole, was more pronounced than that of RA. Therefore, these findings, besides providing further evidence that IIF may be a powerful tool in the development of cancer treatments, suggest that IIF may have therapeutic potential against the invasiveness of brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17786368
"""PRMT6 facilitates EZH2 protein stability by inhibiting TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination degradation to promote glioblastoma cell invasion and migration.""","""Invasion and migration are the key hallmarks of cancer, and aggressive growth is a major factor contributing to treatment failure and poor prognosis in glioblastoma. Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6), as an epigenetic regulator, has been confirmed to promote the malignant proliferation of glioblastoma cells in previous studies. However, the effects of PRMT6 on glioblastoma cell invasion and migration and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that PRMT6 functions as a driver element for tumor cell invasion and migration in glioblastoma. Bioinformatics analysis and glioma sample detection results demonstrated that PRMT6 is highly expressed in mesenchymal subtype or invasive gliomas, and is significantly negatively correlated with their prognosis. Inhibition of PRMT6 (using PRMT6 shRNA or inhibitor EPZ020411) reduces glioblastoma cell invasion and migration in vitro, whereas overexpression of PRMT6 produces opposite effects. Then, we identified that PRMT6 maintains the protein stability of EZH2 by inhibiting the degradation of EZH2 protein, thereby mediating the invasion and migration of glioblastoma cells. Further mechanistic investigations found that PRMT6 inhibits the transcription of TRAF6 by activating the histone methylation mark (H3R2me2a), and reducing the interaction between TRAF6 and EZH2 to enhance the protein stability of EZH2 in glioblastoma cells. Xenograft tumor assay and HE staining results showed that the expression of PRMT6 could promote the invasion of glioblastoma cells in vivo, the immunohistochemical staining results of mouse brain tissue tumor sections also confirmed the regulatory relationship between PRMT6, TRAF6, and EZH2. Our findings illustrate that PRMT6 suppresses TRAF6 transcription via H3R2me2a to enhance the protein stability of EZH2 to facilitate glioblastoma cell invasion and migration. Blocking the PRMT6-TRAF6-EZH2 axis is a promising strategy for inhibiting glioblastoma cell invasion and migration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39043634
"""Glioblastoma microenvironment: The stromal interactions.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common primary brain tumors with poor prognosis due to their aggressive growth accompanied by invasive behavior and therapy-resistance. These features promote a high rate of recurrence; therefore, they are largely incurable. One major cause of the incurability is brought about by the intimate relationship of GBM cells with the microenvironment, which supports the tumor growth in various ways by providing a permissive neighborhood. In the tumor microenvironment are glioma stem cells (GSC); endothelial cells (EC) and hypoxic regions; immune cells and immune modulatory cues; astrocytes; neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Each cell type contributes to GBM pathology in unique ways; therefore, it is necessary to understand such interactions between GBM cells and the stromal cells in order to establish a through understanding of the GBM pathology. By explaining the contribution of each stromal entity to GBM pathology we aim to draw an interaction map for GBMs and promote awareness of the complexity of the GBM microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228161
"""Modeling invasion patterns in the glioblastoma battlefield.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, due to its great infiltration capacity. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the Glioblastoma invasion front is a major challenge with preeminent potential clinical relevances. In the infiltration front, the key features of tumor dynamics relate to biochemical and biomechanical aspects, which result in the extension of cellular protrusions known as tumor microtubes. The coordination of metalloproteases expression, extracellular matrix degradation, and integrin activity emerges as a leading mechanism that facilitates Glioblastoma expansion and infiltration in uncontaminated brain regions. We propose a novel multidisciplinary approach, based on in vivo experiments in Drosophila and mathematical models, that describes the dynamics of active and inactive integrins in relation to matrix metalloprotease concentration and tumor density at the Glioblastoma invasion front. The mathematical model is based on a non-linear system of evolution equations in which the mechanisms leading chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and front dynamics compete with the movement induced by the saturated flux in porous media. This approach is able to capture the relative influences of the involved agents and reproduce the formation of patterns, which drive tumor front evolution. These patterns have the value of providing biomarker information that is related to the direction of the dynamical evolution of the front and based on static measures of proteins in several tumor samples. Furthermore, we consider in our model biomechanical elements, like the tissue porosity, as indicators of the healthy tissue resistance to tumor progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513131

However, the association of miR-18a, an important member of this cluster, with glioblastoma remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression of miR-18a in glioblastoma and its role in biological behavior of U87 and U251 human glioblastoma cell lines. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that miR-18a was highly expressed in glioblastoma tissues and U87 and U251 cell lines compared with that in human brain tissues and primary normal human astrocytes, and the expression levels were increased along with the rising pathological grades of glioblastoma. Neogenin was identified as the target gene of miR-18a by dual-luciferase reporter assays. RT-PCR and western blot results showed that its expression levels were decreased along with the rising pathological grades of glioblastoma. Inhibition of miR-18a expression was established by transfecting exogenous miR-18a inhibitor into U87 and U251 cells, and its effects on the biological behavior of glioblastoma cells were studied using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. Inhibition of miR-18a expression in U87 and U251 cells significantly up-regulated neogenin, and dramatically suppressed the abilities of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted cellular apoptosis.

Glutamate that is released by system xc plays an important role in the infiltration of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Furthermore, increased glutathione synthesis by system xc may protect tumor cells against oxidative stress induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Objective: To investigate whether the levels of xCT expression correlated with infiltrative imaging phenotypes on magnetic resonance imaging and outcomes in patients with GBMs. Methods: Forty patients with histologically confirmed primary GBMs were included in the study. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score, Mini-Mental State Examination score, magnetic resonance imaging features, xCT expression, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H expression, O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status, type of surgery, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: In invasive margins, xCT expression was weak in 20 patients and strong in 20 patients. A Cox regression model revealed that a Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score less than 60 (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.525; P = .01), partial removal (HR: 2.839; P = .03), and strong xCT expression (HR: 4.134; P < .001) were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival and that partial removal (HR: 2.865; P = .03), weak isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H expression (HR: 15.729; P = .01), and strong xCT expression (HR: 2.863; P = .04) were significantly associated with shorter overall survival.

"""Rational design of ROS-responsive nanocarriers for targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy and cascaded chemotherapy of intracranial glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary intracranial tumor because of its high invasiveness and recurrence. Therefore, nanocarriers with blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and transcranial-controlled drug release and activation are rather attractive options for glioblastoma treatment. Herein, we designed a multifunctional nanocarrier (T-TKNPVP) that combined targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) and cascaded reactive oxygen species (ROS)-boosted chemotherapy. The T-TKNPVP loaded with verteporfin (VP) and paclitaxel (PTX) was self-assembled from an angiopep-2 (Ang) peptide, functionalized Ang-PEG-DSPE and ROS-sensitive PEG-TK-PTX conjugate. After systemic injection, the T-TKNPVP efficiently crossed the BBB and targeted the GBM cells via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Upon X-ray irradiation, they can generate a certain amount of ROS, which not only induces X-PDT but also locoregionally activates PTX release and action by cleaving the TK bridged bonds. As evidenced by 9.4 T MRI and other experiments, such nanocarriers offer significant growth inhibition of GBM in situ and prolong the survival times of U87-MG tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, the designed T-TKNPVP provided an alternative avenue for realizing transcranial X-PDT and X-ray-activated chemotherapy for targeted and locoregional GBM treatment in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35293920
"""[The sodium pump could constitute a new target to combat glioblastomas].""","""Malignant gliomas of which glioblastomas represent the ultimate grade of malignancy are characterized by dismal prognoses because malignant glioma cells present both important proliferation and neoangiogenesis processes and can actively migrate through the narrow extra-cellular spaces in the brain, often travelling relatively long distances, making them elusive targets for effective surgical management. Invasive malignant glioma cells show a decrease in their proliferation rates and a relative resistance to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) as compared to the highly cellular centre of the tumour, and this may contribute to their resistance to conventional proapoptotic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The multidisciplinary up to date treatment for glioblastoma patients combined maximal surgical removal of the tumor with postoperative radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with temozolomide. Temozolomide is a proautophagic (type II programmed cell death) drug and can thus circumvent part of the glioblastoma resistance to apoptosis. Another way to potentially overcome apoptosis resistance is to decrease the migration of malignant glioma cells in the brain, which then should restore a level of sensitivity to proapoptotic drugs. The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase or sodium pump is an ion transporter which in addition to exchanging cations, is also the ligand for cardenolides and is directly involved in the migration of cancer cells in general and of glioma cells in particular. We have shown that the alpha1 subunit of the sodium pump is highly expressed in glioma cells compared to normal brain tissues and we are the first to propose the alpha1 subunit of the sodium pump as a new target in the context of malignant glioma treatment. Using a novel cardenolide with unique structural features, which markedly inhibits sodium pump activity and binds to the alpha1 subunit, we have shown marked anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects on human glioblastoma cells (and other cancer cell types). We have characterized at least partially the anti-cancer mechanism of action of the novel cardenolide. It is a ligand of the alpha1 subunit of the pump which impairs the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells by disorganizing the actin cytoskeleton and inducing severe autophagic process in glioblastoma cells. Collectively, these data suggests that the novel cardenolide is an attractive candidate for preclinical and clinical development, at least in the area of glioblastoma.

"""Anthocyanidins inhibit migration of glioblastoma cells: structure-activity relationship and involvement of the plasminolytic system.""","""Complete resection of malignant glioblastomas is usually impossible because of diffuse and widespread invasion of tumor cells, and complementary approaches need to be developed in order to improve the efficacy of current treatments. Consumption of fruits and berries has been associated with decreased risk of developing cancer and there is great interest in the use of molecules from dietary origin to improve anticancer therapies. In this work, we report that the aglycons of the most abundant anthocyanins in fruits, cyanidin (Cy), delphinidin (Dp), and petunidin (Pt), act as potent inhibitors of glioblastoma cell migration. Dp clearly exhibited the highest inhibitory potency, this effect being related to the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl structure on the B-ring and the presence of a free hydroxyl group at position 3. Dp decreases the expression of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), acting at the transcriptional levels. In addition, Dp upregulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and downregulated the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) but decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the uPA-dependent conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, indicating that the upregulation of uPA observed with these compounds was not associated with induction of the plasminolytic activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that Dp, Pt, and Cy affect plasminogen activation, thus leading to the inhibition of glioblastoma cell migration and therefore they may be helpful for the development of new strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16823770

The associations between sSVZCC invasion and the survival and progression patterns were analyzed. Results: In total, 108 patients, including 36 with sSVZCC invasion, were followed for a median period of 60.2 (range 34.2-86.3) months.

"""Guanylate binding protein 1 is a novel effector of EGFR-driven invasion in glioblastoma.""","""Although GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) was among the first interferon-inducible proteins identified, its function is still largely unknown. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation by amplification or mutation is one of the most frequent genetic lesions in a variety of human tumors. These include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is characterized by independent but interrelated features of extensive invasion into normal brain parenchyma, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis. In this study, we show that EGFR activation promoted GBP1 expression in GBM cell lines through a signaling pathway involving Src and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, we identified YY1 (Yin Yang 1) as the downstream transcriptional regulator regulating EGFR-driven GBP1 expression. GBP1 was required for EGFR-mediated MMP1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1) expression and glioma cell invasion in vitro. Although deregulation of GBP1 expression did not affect glioma cell proliferation, overexpression of GBP1 enhanced glioma cell invasion through MMP1 induction, which required its C-terminal helical domain and was independent of its GTPase activity. Reducing GBP1 levels by RNA interference in invasive GBM cells also markedly inhibited their ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma of mice. GBP1 expression was high and positively correlated with EGFR expression in human GBM tumors and cell lines, particularly those of the neural subtype. Together, these findings establish GBP1 as a previously unknown link between EGFR activity and MMP1 expression and nominate it as a novel potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22162832

In this respect, microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play a role in cancer aggressiveness, emerge as possible relevant prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant gliomas. We previously described a tissue model of GBM developing into a stem cell-derived human Engineered Neural Tissue (ENT) that allows the study of tumor/host tissue interaction.

Methods: In 142 patients (94 BEV/IRI, 48 TMZ), we reviewed magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and first tumor recurrence. Based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, we assessed tumor growth patterns and tumor invasiveness. Tumor growth patterns were classified as either multifocal or local at baseline and recurrence; at first recurrence, we additionally assessed whether distant lesions appeared. Invasiveness was determined as either diffuse or non-diffuse. Associations with treatment arms were calculated using Fisher's exact test. Results: At baseline, 115 of 142 evaluable patients (81%) had a locally confined tumor. Between treatment arms, there was no significant difference in the fraction of tumors that changed from an initially local tumor growth pattern to a multifocal pattern (12 and 13%, p = 0.55). Distant lesions appeared in 17% (BEV/IRI) and 13% (TMZ) of patients (p = 0.69). 15% of patients in the BEV/IRI arm and 8% in the TMZ arm developed a diffuse growth pattern from an initially non-diffuse pattern (p = 0.42).

"""Reciprocal activation of transcription factors underlies the dichotomy between proliferation and invasion of glioma cells.""","""Histology of malignant glioma depicts dense proliferative areas rich in angiogenesis as well as dissemination of neoplastic cells into adjacent brain tissue. Although the mechanisms that trigger transition from proliferative to invasive phenotypes are complex, the dichotomy of cell proliferation and migration, the 'Go or Grow' hypothesis, argues for specific and coordinated regulation of these phenotypes. We investigated transcriptional elements that accompany the phenotypes of migration and proliferation, and consider the therapeutic significance of the 'Go or Grow' hypothesis. Interrogation of matched core and rim regions from human glioblastoma biopsy specimens in situ (n = 44) revealed higher proliferation (Ki67 labeling index) in cells residing at the core compared to the rim. Profiling activated transcription factors in a panel of migration-activated versus migration-restricted GBM cells portrayed strong NF-ÎºB activity in the migratory cell population. In contrast, increased c-Myc activity was found in migration-restricted proliferative cells. Validation of transcriptional activity by NF-ÎºB- or c-Myc-driven GFP or RFP, respectively, showed an increased NF-ÎºB activity in the active migrating cells, whereas the proliferative, migration restricted cells displayed increased c-Myc activity. Immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens validated a robust phosphorylated c-Myc staining in tumor cells at the core, whereas increased phosphorylated NF-ÎºB staining was detected in the invasive tumor cells at the rim. Functional genomics revealed that depletion of c-Myc expression by siRNA oligonucleotides reduced cell proliferation in vitro, but surprisingly, cell migration was enhanced significantly. Conversely, inhibition of NF-ÎºB by pharmacological inhibitors, SN50 or BAY-11, decreased both cell migration in vitro and invasion ex vivo. Notably, inhibition of NF-ÎºB was found to have no effect on the proliferation rate of glioma cells. These findings suggest that the reciprocal and coordinated suppression/activation of transcription factors, such as c-Myc and NF-ÎºB may underlie the shift of glioma cells from a 'growing-to-going' phenotype.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23967279

Radiation therapy aims to eradicate microscopic residual GBM cells after surgical removal of the visible tumor bulk. However, in-field recurrences remain the major pattern of therapy failure. We hypothesized that the radiosensitivity of peripheral invasive tumor cells (peri) may differ from the predominantly investigated tumor bulk. Methods and materials: Invasive GBM populations were generated via debulking of the visible tumor core and serial orthotopic transplantation of peri cells, and sustained proinvasive phenotype of peri cells was confirmed in vitro by scratch assay and time lapse imaging. In parallel, invasive GBM cells were selected by transwell assay and from peri cells of patient-derived 3-dimensional spheroid cultures. Transcriptome analysis deciphered a GBM invasion-associated gene signature, and functional involvement of key pathways was validated by pharmacologic inhibition. Results: Compared with the bulk cells, invasive GBM populations acquired a radioresistant phenotype characterized by increased cell survival, reduced cell apoptosis, and enhanced DNA double-strand break repair proficiency. Transcriptome analysis revealed a reprograming of invasive cells toward augmented activation of epidermal growth factor receptor- and nuclear factor-ÎºB-related pathways, whereas metabolic processes were downregulated. An invasive GBM score derived from this transcriptional fingerprint correlated well with patient outcome. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling resensitized invasive cells to irradiation.

Functional annotation revealed that these genes participate in key processes of cancer cell biology, providing insights into the genetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma. The robustness of the gene selection was validated on an external microarray data set including 81 glioblastomas and 23 non-neoplastic brain samples. The integration of array CGH and gene expression data highlights a robust cis-acting DNA targeted genes signature that may be critical for glioblastoma progression, with two tumor suppressor genes PCDH9 and STARD13 that could be involved in tumor invasiveness and resistance to etoposide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18828157
"""C5alpha secreted by tumor mesenchymal stem-like cells mediates resistance to 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy against glioblastoma tumorspheres.""","""Purpose: Advancements in photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a standard care in cancer therapy have been limited. This study is aimed to investigate the clinical availability of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based PDD and PDT in glioblastoma (GBM) patient-derived tumorspheres (TSs) and mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Methods: PDT was performed using a 635 nm light-emitting diode (LED). Transcriptome profiles were obtained from microarray data. For knockdown of C5Î±, siRNA was transfected into tumor mesenchymal stem-like cells (tMSLCs). The invasiveness of TSs was quantified using collagen-based 3D invasion assays. Results: Treatment with 1 mM 5 ALA induced distinct protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in GBM TSs, but not in non-tumor cells or tissues, including tMSLCs. These observations were negatively correlated with the expression levels of FECH, which catalyzes the conversion of accumulated PpIX to heme. Furthermore, the 5-ALA-treated GBM TSs were sensitive to PDT, thereby significantly decreasing cell viability and invasiveness. Notably, the effects of PDT were abolished by culturing TSs with tMSLC-conditioned media. Transcriptome analysis revealed diverse tMSLC-secreted chemokines, including C5Î±, and their correlations with the expression of stemness- or mesenchymal transition-associated genes. By adding or inhibiting C5Î±, we confirmed that acquired resistance to PDT was induced via tMSLC-secreted C5Î±. Conclusions: Our results show substantial therapeutic effects of 5-ALA-based PDT on GBM TSs, suggesting C5Î± as a key molecule responsible for PDT resistance. These findings could trigger PDT as a standard clinical modality for the treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36107247
"""Humanized chondroitinase ABC sensitizes glioblastoma cells to temozolomide.""","""Background: Malignant gliomas (glioblastomas; GBMs) are extremely aggressive and have a median survival of approximately 15 months. Current treatment modalities, which include surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, have done little to prolong the lives of GBM patients. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) are critical for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and are implicated in glioma growth and invasion. Chondroitinase (Chase) ABC is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves chondroitin sulfate disaccharide chains from CSPGs in the tumor ECM. Wild-type Chase ABC has limited stability and/or activity in mammalian cells; therefore, we created a mutant humanized version (Chase M) with enhanced function in mammalian cells. Methods: We hypothesized that disruption of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions by ChaseM and temozolomide (TMZ) will enhance the chemotherapeutic availability and sensitivity of glioma cells. Results: Utilizing primary patient-derived neurospheres, we found that ChaseM decreases glioma neurosphere aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, an oncolytic HSV-1 virus expressing secreted ChaseM (OV-ChaseM) enhanced viral spread and glioma cell killing compared to OV-Control, in vitro. OV-ChaseM plus TMZ combinatorial treatment resulted in a significant synergistic enhancement of glioma cell killing accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cell death. Intracellular flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of the pro-survival AKT protein following OV-ChaseM plus TMZ treatment. Lastly, in nude mice bearing intracranial GBM30 glioma xenografts, intratumoral OV-ChaseM plus TMZ (10 mg/kg by oral gavage) combination therapy resulted in a significant (p < 0.02) enhancement of survival compared to each individual treatment alone. Conclusions: These data reveal that OV-ChaseM enhances glioma cell viral susceptibility and sensitivity to TMZ.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28087981
"""Tumor treating fields (TTFields) impairs aberrant glycolysis in glioblastoma as evaluated by [(18)F]DASA-23, a non-invasive probe of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression.""","""Despite the anti-proliferative and survival benefits from tumor treating fields (TTFields) in human glioblastoma (hGBM), little is known about the effects of this form of alternating electric fields therapy on the aberrant glycolysis of hGBM. [18F]FDG is the most common radiotracer in cancer metabolic imaging, but its utility in hGBM is impaired due to high glucose uptake in normal brain tissue. With TTFields, radiochemistry, Western blot, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a biomarker of hGBM response to therapeutic TTFields. We used [18F]DASA-23, a novel radiotracer that measures PKM2 expression and which has been shown to be safe in humans, to detect a shift away from hGBM aberrant glycolysis in response to TTFields. Compared to unexposed hGBM, [18F]DASA-23 uptake was reduced in hGBM exposed to TTFields (53%, P< 0.05) or temozolomide chemotherapy (33%, P > 0.05) for 3 d. A 6-d TTFields exposure resulted in a 31% reduction (P = 0.043) in 60-min uptake of [18F]DASA-23. [18F]DASA-23 was retained after a 10 but not 30-min wash-out period. Compared to [18F]FDG, [18F]DASA-23 demonstrated a 4- to 9-fold greater uptake, implying an improved tumor-to-background ratio. Furthermore, compared to no-TTFields exposure, a 6-d TTFields exposure caused a 35% reduction in [18F]DASA-23 30-min uptake compared to only an 8% reduction in [18F]FDG 30-min uptake. Quantitative Western blot analysis and qualitative immunofluorescence for PKM2 confirmed the TTFields-induced reduction in PKM2 expression. This is the first study to demonstrate that TTFields impairs hGBM aberrant glycolytic metabolism through reduced PKM2 expression, which can be non-invasively detected by the [18F]DASA-23 radiotracer.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33221711
"""Overexpression of GBP1 predicts poor prognosis and promotes tumor growth in human glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Objective: Guanylate binding protein-1 (GBP1) is highly associated with cell proliferation, and can modulate growth and invasiveness of gliomas. The relationship between GBP1 expression and the prognosis of glioma patients is further evaluated for the purpose of investigating whether GBP1 can serve as an predictor for evaluating prognosis of glioma patients. Methods: GBP1 expression in 528 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were investigated, then 103 surgical specimens from glioma patients in our center were further evaluated. The effect of GBP1 on proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells in vitro was analyzed, and the effects of GBP1 on sensitivity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on glioma cells in vitro were also analyzed. GBP1 associated signaling pathways were identified with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Besides, the effect of GBP1 expression on proliferation of glioma cells in vivo was analyzed. Results: In both TCGA database and our clinical data, GBM tissues exhibited increased mRNA expression of GBP1 gene, its expression level was co-related to PETN deletion and EGFR amplification, and was associated with prognosis of GBM patients. GBP1 overexpression can enhance migration and invasion ability of tumor cells in vitro, and in vivo studies showed that GBP1 can promote tumor proliferation, decrease survival in tumor-bearing mice. GSEA analysis predicted that GBP1 may play its biological roles via toll-like receptor pathway. Conclusion: This study provides new insights and evidences that high level expression of GBP1 is significantly correlated with progression and prognosis in GBMs. Furthermore, transfection of GBP1 revealed its regulation on migration and invasiveness of glioma cells, decreasing sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agent, shortening survival of tumor-bearing animals. These data demonstrate that GBP1 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29991124
"""Modulation of invasive properties of human glioblastoma cells stably expressing amino-terminal fragment of urokinase-type plasminogen activator.""","""The binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to its receptor (uPAR) on the surface of tumor cells is involved in the activation of proteolytic cascades responsible for the invasiveness of those cells. The diffuse, extensive infiltration of glioblastomas into the surrounding normal brain tissue is believed to rely on modifications of the proteolysis of extracellular matrix components; blocking the interaction between uPA and uPAR might be a suitable approach for inhibiting glioma tumorigenesis. We assessed how expression of an amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of uPA that contains binding site to uPAR affects the invasiveness of SNB19 human glioblastoma cells. SNB19 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid (pcDNA3-ATF) containing a cDNA sequence of ATF-uPA. The resulting ATF-uPA-expressing clones showed markedly less cell adhesion, spreading, and clonogenicity than did control cells. Endogenous ATF expression also significantly decreased the invasive capacity of transfected glioblastoma cells in Matrigel and spheroid-rat brain cell aggregate models. ATF-uPA transfectants were also markedly less invasive than parental SNB19 cells after injection into the brains of nude mice, suggesting that competitive inhibition of the uPA-uPAR interaction on SNB19 cells by means of transfection with ATF cDNA could be a useful therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12420219
"""Natural Compounds as Promising Adjuvant Agents in The Treatment of Gliomas.""","""In humans, glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor. Usually, glioblastoma has specific characteristics, such as aggressive cell proliferation and rapid invasion of surrounding brain tissue, leading to a poor patient prognosis. The current therapy-which provides a multidisciplinary approach with surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide-is not very efficient since it faces clinical challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, invasiveness, and chemoresistance. In this respect, natural substances in the diet, integral components in the lifestyle medicine approach, can be seen as potential chemotherapeutics. There are several epidemiological studies that have shown the chemopreventive role of natural dietary compounds in cancer progression and development. These heterogeneous compounds can produce anti-glioblastoma effects through upregulation of apoptosis and autophagy; allowing the promotion of cell cycle arrest; interfering with tumor metabolism; and permitting proliferation, neuroinflammation, chemoresistance, angiogenesis, and metastasis inhibition. Although these beneficial effects are promising, the efficacy of natural compounds in glioblastoma is limited due to their bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeability. Thereby, further clinical trials are necessary to confirm the in vitro and in vivo anticancer properties of natural compounds. In this article, we overview the role of several natural substances in the treatment of glioblastoma by considering the challenges to be overcome and future prospects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328780

We have recently reported that the levels of uPA and uPAR were higher in malignant astrocytomas than in low-grade gliomas. In the present study, we measured the levels of uPA and uPAR during the growth of glioblastomas in nude mice. Using fibrin zymography, densitometry, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that the enzyme activity and content of uPA were increased 4- to 10-fold during tumor formation. Using a receptor assay and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, we found the numbers and content of uPAR were increased 5- to 15-fold during tumor formation. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for uPA and uPAR revealed strong immunoreactivity in tumor cells with the staining more intense on day 28 than on day 14.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is often expressed in human tumors including astrocytic tumors. To elucidate the possible regulation mechanism of uPA gene expression in astrocytic tumors, quantitative RT-PCR was performed to monitor the gene expression of uPA and the transcription factor Ets-1. Expression of uPA and Ets-1 genes was up-regulated in astrocytic tumors, but was not detected in normal brain. Expression levels of uPA correlated with those of Ets-1, and also with the degree of malignancy of the tumors. Glioma cell lines U251, U87, and T98G also expressed both uPA and Ets-1 genes. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ets-1, which competitively inhibits Ets-1 function, abolished uPA expression in U251 cells. Parental U251 cells showed invasive growth in 3-dimensional collagen gel, however, cells expressing dominant negative Ets-1 failed to grow invasively in the collagen gel. Treatment of U251 cells with the uPA inhibitor aprotinin also inhibited spreading of cells into collagen gel. These results suggest that Ets-1 plays an essential role in regulation of uPA gene expression, which in turn contributes to the invasive growth of astrocytic tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10218628

In this study, the expression pattern, prognostic value and function of PLEKHG5 in gliomas were investigated. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression pattern of PLEKHG5 in 61 glioma patients after curative resection. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PLEKHG5. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to predict potential functions of PLEKHG5. Migration assay and western blot analysis determined PLEKHG5 function in glioma migration and invasion. Results: Increased PLEKHG5 expression levels were associated with higher glioma grades (P < 0.05). In addition, glioblastomas multiforme have higher ratio and stronger intensity of PLEKHG5 expression compared with low-grade gliomas. High expression level of PLEKHG5 indicated poorer prognosis and shorter survival time in all glioma patients (P < 0.001). GO analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and GSEA analysis suggested that PLEKHG5 was involved in glioma migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

"""Radiogenomic mapping of edema/cellular invasion MRI-phenotypes in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: Despite recent discoveries of new molecular targets and pathways, the search for an effective therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) continues. A newly emerged field, radiogenomics, links gene expression profiles with MRI phenotypes. MRI-FLAIR is a noninvasive diagnostic modality and was previously found to correlate with cellular invasion in GBM. Thus, our radiogenomic screen has the potential to reveal novel molecular determinants of invasion. Here, we present the first comprehensive radiogenomic analysis using quantitative MRI volumetrics and large-scale gene- and microRNA expression profiling in GBM. Methods: Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), discovery and validation sets with gene, microRNA, and quantitative MR-imaging data were created. Top concordant genes and microRNAs correlated with high FLAIR volumes from both sets were further characterized by Kaplan Meier survival statistics, microRNA-gene correlation analyses, and GBM molecular subtype-specific distribution. Results: The top upregulated gene in both the discovery (4 fold) and validation (11 fold) sets was PERIOSTIN (POSTN). The top downregulated microRNA in both sets was miR-219, which is predicted to bind to POSTN. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated that above median expression of POSTN resulted in significantly decreased survival and shorter time to disease progression (P<0.001). High POSTN and low miR-219 expression were significantly associated with the mesenchymal GBM subtype (P<0.0001). Conclusion: Here, we propose a novel diagnostic method to screen for molecular cancer subtypes and genomic correlates of cellular invasion. Our findings also have potential therapeutic significance since successful molecular inhibition of invasion will improve therapy and patient survival in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21998659
"""Inhibition of ATR opposes glioblastoma invasion through disruption of cytoskeletal networks and integrin internalization via macropinocytosis.""","""Background: Glioblastomas have highly infiltrative growth patterns that contribute to recurrence and poor survival. Despite infiltration being a critical therapeutic target, no clinically useful therapies exist that counter glioblastoma invasion. Here, we report that inhibition of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad 3 related kinase (ATR) reduces invasion of glioblastoma cells through dysregulation of cytoskeletal networks and subsequent integrin trafficking. Methods: Glioblastoma motility and invasion were assessed in vitro and in vivo in response to ATR inhibition (ATRi) and ATR overexpression using time-lapse microscopy, two orthotopic glioblastoma models, and intravital imaging. Disruption to cytoskeleton networks and endocytic processing were investigated via high-throughput, super-resolution and intravital imaging. Results: High ATR expression was associated with significantly poorer survival in clinical datasets while histological, protein expression, and spatial transcriptomics using glioblastoma tumor specimens revealed higher ATR expression at infiltrative margins. Pharmacological inhibition with two different compounds and RNAi targeting of ATR opposed the invasion of glioblastoma, whereas overexpression of ATR drove migration. Subsequent investigation revealed that cytoskeletal dysregulation reduced macropinocytotic internalization of integrins at growth-cone-like structures, resulting in a tumor microtube retraction defect. The biological relevance and translational potential of these findings were confirmed using two orthotopic in vivo models of glioblastoma and intravital imaging. Conclusions: We demonstrate a novel role for ATR in determining invasion in glioblastoma cells and propose that pharmacological targeting of ATR could have far-reaching clinical benefits beyond radiosensitization.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37936324
"""Spatial Dissection of Invasive Front from Tumor Mass Enables Discovery of Novel microRNA Drivers of Glioblastoma Invasion.""","""Diffuse invasion is the primary cause of treatment failure of glioblastoma (GBM). Previous studies on GBM invasion have long been forced to use the resected tumor mass cells. Here, a strategy to reliably isolate matching pairs of invasive (GBMINV ) and tumor core (GBMTC ) cells from the brains of 6 highly invasive patient-derived orthotopic models is described. Direct comparison of these GBMINV and GBMTC cells reveals a significantly elevated invasion capacity in GBMINV cells, detects 23/768 miRNAs over-expressed in the GBMINV cells (miRNAINV ) and 22/768 in the GBMTC cells (miRNATC ), respectively. Silencing the top 3 miRNAsINV (miR-126, miR-369-5p, miR-487b) successfully blocks invasion of GBMINV cells in vitro and in mouse brains. Integrated analysis with mRNA expression identifies miRNAINV target genes and discovers KCNA1 as the sole common computational target gene of which 3 inhibitors significantly suppress invasion in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) effectively eliminates GBM invasion and significantly prolongs animal survival times (P = 0.035).

There is a widely acknowledged need for anti-invasive therapeutics to limit glioblastoma invasion. BKM-120 is a CNS-penetrant pan-class I phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor in clinical trials for solid tumors, including glioblastoma. We observed that BKM-120 has potent anti-invasive effects in glioblastoma cell lines and patient-derived glioma cells in vitro. These anti-migratory effects were clearly distinguishable from cytostatic and cytotoxic effects at higher drug concentrations and longer durations of drug exposure. The effects were reversible and accompanied by changes in cell morphology and pronounced reduction in both cell/cell and cell/substrate adhesion. In vivo studies showed that a short period of treatment with BKM-120 slowed tumor spread in an intracranial xenografts. GDC-0941, a similar potent and selective PI3K inhibitor, only caused a moderate reduction in glioblastoma cell migration. The effects of BKM-120 and GDC-0941 were indistinguishable by in vitro kinase selectivity screening and phospho-protein arrays. BKM-120 reduced the numbers of focal adhesions and the velocity of microtubule treadmilling compared with GDC-0941, suggesting that mechanisms in addition to PI3K inhibition contribute to the anti-invasive effects of BKM-120.

The transfection was performed using lipo2000. MTT assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, Transwell assay as well as flow cytometry were employed to determine the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and mitosis of UG87 MG cell line. Besides, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the direct targeting relationship between miR-217 and YWHAG. Xenograft models were also constructed and the effect of miR-217 on tumor growth was studied in vivo. Results: MiR-217 was up-regulated, whereas YWHAG was down-regulated in glioblastoma tissues and cells. The down-regulation of miR-217 or the up-regulation of YWHAG suppressed the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and mitosis of U87 MG cells in vitro. In addition, MiR-217 directly targeted 3'UTR of YWHAG and suppressed the expression of YWHAG. Up-regulation of miR-217 could efficiently attenuate the inhibitory effects of YWHAG overexpression on the proliferation and metastasis of U87 MG cells. YWHAG was able to accelerate the phosphorylation of MDM4 and lead to the degradation of P53, which provides a potential mechanism for the tumor-promoting role of miR-217 in glioblastoma cells. By constructing xenograft models, it was also confirmed that miR-217 could promote tumor growth in vivo.

"""Glioblastoma inhibition by cell surface immunoglobulin protein EWI-2, in vitro and in vivo.""","""EWI-2, a cell surface IgSF protein, is highly expressed in normal human brain but is considerably diminished in glioblastoma tumors and cell lines. Moreover, loss of EWI-2 expression correlated with a shorter survival time in human glioma patients, suggesting that EWI-2 might be a natural inhibitor of glioblastoma. In support of this idea, EWI-2 expression significantly impaired both ectopic and orthotopic tumor growth in nude mice in vivo. In vitro assays provided clues regarding EWI-2 functions. Expression of EWI-2 in T98G and/or U87-MG malignant glioblastoma cell lines failed to alter two-dimensional cell proliferation but inhibited glioblastoma colony formation in soft agar and caused diminished cell motility and invasion. At the biochemical level, EWI-2 markedly affects the organization of four molecules (tetraspanin proteins CD9 and CD81 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MT1-MMP), which play key roles in the biology of astrocytes and gliomas. EWI-2 causes CD9 and CD81 to become more associated with each other, whereas CD81 and other tetraspanins become less associated with MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. We propose that EWI-2 inhibition of glioblastoma growth in vivo is at least partly explained by the capability of EWI-2 to inhibit growth and/or invasion in vitro. Underlying these functional effects, EWI-2 causes a substantial molecular reorganization of multiple molecules (CD81, CD9, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP) known to affect proliferation and/or invasion of astrocytes and/or glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19107234

Understanding the stages of malignant brain tumor progression requires a series of experimental approaches with a varying degree of complexity. Implantation of malignant cells into animal brain tissue closely resembles in vivo tumor growth and has the advantage over simplified models that inflammatory and vascular mechanisms are activated. However, the complexity of these models makes it difficult to identify the individual processes involved in sustained tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion. In cell culture models, the effect of growth factors, extracellular matrix components, proteases and adhesion molecules can be investigated. The secretion of tumor-derived factors into the medium can also be analyzed when simplified models are used.

"""Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9.""","""The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor involved in the metabolism of various extracellular ligands, including proteinases, that play critical roles in tumor invasion. Although several studies have shown an increased expression of LRP1 in cancer cells, its function in tumor development and progression remains largely unclear. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism by which LRP1 induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 and thereby promotes the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells. Knockdown of LRP1 expression greatly decreased U87 cell migration and invasion, which was rescued by the forced expression of a functional LRP1 minireceptor. Inhibition of ligand binding to LRP1 by a specific antagonist, receptor-associated protein, also led to reduced cancer cell migration and invasion. Because MMPs play critical roles in cancer cell migration and invasion, we examined the expression of several MMPs and found that the expression of functional MMP2 and MMP9 was selectively decreased in LRP1 knockdown cells. More importantly, decreased cell migration and invasion of LRP1 knockdown cells were completely rescued by exogenous expression of MMP2 or MMP9, suggesting that these MMPs are likely downstream targets of LRP1-mediated signaling. We further show that the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly decreased in LRP1-silenced cells, suggesting that ERK is a potential mediator of LRP1-regulated MMP2 and MMP9 expression in U87 cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that LRP1 promotes glioblastoma cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression and function of MMP2 and MMP9 perhaps via an ERK-dependent signaling pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19176371
"""Correlation of the invasive potential of glioblastoma and expression of caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and CAVIN1.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer. The average survival time for the majority of patients is approximately 15 months after diagnosis. A major feature of GBM that contributes to its poor prognosis is its high invasiveness. Caveolae are plasma membrane subdomains that participate in numerous biological functions. Caveolin-1 and Caveolae Associated Protein 1 (CAVIN1), formerly termed Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor, are both necessary for caveola formation. We hypothesized that high expression of caveola-forming proteins in GBM promotes invasiveness via modulation of the production of matrix-degrading enzymes. Methods: The mRNA expression of caveola-forming proteins and matrix proteases in GBM samples, and survival after stratifying patients according to caveolin-1 or CAVIN1 expression, were analyzed from TCGA and REMBRANDT databases. The proteolytic profile of cell lines expressing or devoid of caveola-forming proteins was investigated using zymography and real-time qPCR. Invasion through basement membrane-like protein was investigated in vitro. Results: Expression of both caveolin-1 and CAVIN1 was increased in GBM compared to normal samples and correlated with expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and gelatinases. High expression of caveola-forming proteins was associated with shorter survival time. GBM cell lines capable of forming caveolae expressed more uPA and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and/or -9 (MMP-9) and were more invasive than GBM cells devoid of caveola-forming proteins. Experimental manipulation of caveolin-1 or CAVIN1 expression in GBM cells recapitulated some, but not all of these features.

Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed eight-fold more Î²1 integrin in primary BRG cells compared with cells from bevacizumab-naÃ¯ve glioblastomas (BNG). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of cells engineered to express a Î²1-GFP fusion protein indicated that the mobile Î²1 integrin fraction was doubled, and half-life of Î²1 integrin turnover in focal adhesions was reduced markedly in BRG cells compared with bevacizumab-responsive glioblastoma multiforme cells. Hypoxia, which was increased with acquisition of bevacizumab resistance, was associated with increased Î²1 integrin expression in cultured BNG cells. BRGs displayed an aggressive mesenchymal-like phenotype in vitro. We found that growth of BRG xenograft tumors was attenuated by the Î²1 antibody, OS2966, allowing a 20-fold dose reduction of bevacizumab per cycle in this model. Intracranial delivery of OS2966 through osmotic pumps over 28 days increased tumor cell apoptosis, decreased tumor cell invasiveness, and blunted the mesenchymal morphology of tumor cells. We concluded that Î²1 integrin upregulation in BRGs likely reflects an onset of hypoxia caused by antiangiogenic therapy, and that Î²1 inhibition is well tolerated in vivo as a tractable strategy to disrupt resistance to this therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23644530
"""MSX1 inhibits cell migration and invasion through regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor with poor prognosis. The hallmark phenotype of glioblastoma is its aggressive invasion. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the invasion behavior of glioblastoma is essential for the development of effective treatment of the disease. In our present study, we found that the expression levels of a homeobox transcription factor, MSX1, were significantly reduced in glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissues. The levels of MSX1 in glioblastoma tissues were also correlated with the survival of the patients. In cultured glioblastoma cells, MSX1 was a negative regulator of cell migration and invasion. Loss of MSX1 enhanced cell migration and induced mesenchymal transition as characterized by the downregulation of E-cadherin and the upregulation of N-cadherin. Overexpression of MSX1 on the other hand led to the inhibition of both cell migration and mesenchymal transition. We also found that MSX1 was able to inhibit the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, and that the ability to regulate the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway is critical for MSX1 to suppress glioblastoma cell migration and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26271668

Although standardized therapies are routinely employed, it is clear that these strategies are unable to cope with heterogeneity and invasiveness of GBM. Furthermore, diagnosis and monitoring of responses to therapies are directly dependent on tissue biopsies or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. From this point of view, liquid biopsies are arising as key sources of a variety of biomarkers with the advantage of being easily accessible and monitorable. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs), physiologically shed into body fluids by virtually all cells, are gaining increasing interest both as natural carriers of biomarkers and as specific signatures even for GBM. What makes these vesicles particularly attractive is they are also emerging as therapeutical vehicles to treat GBM given their native ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

The role of miR-124 and Capn4 in the migration and invasion of glioma cells in vitro was also examined. miR-124 and Capn4 expression in 20 GBM and 6 control brain specimens was examined using RT-qPCR and immuno-blotting. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were retrieved. Candidate mRNA target sites of miR-124 were predicted using TargetScan/microRNA and binding was examined using dual luciferase reporter assays. The U87 and U251 cells were transfected with scrambled microRNA, miR-124 mimics and/or pLenti-Capn4 prior to woundâhealing and Transwell invasion assays. Proteins involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition were examined using immunoblotting. The results showed that miR-124 was significantly downregulated in GBM tissues. Immunoblotting showed a marked upregulation of Capn4 expression in GBM tissues. The Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a negative association between miR-124 expression and Capn4 protein levels. TargetScan/microRNA predicted the miR-124 binding site in the nucleotide 440-446 region within the Capn4 3'-UTR, which was confirmed by luciferase assays. Woundâhealing and Transwell invasion assays demonstrated that Capn4 downregulation or miR-124 mimics suppressed the migration and invasion of glioma cells. Capn4 downregulation or miR-124 mimics reduced the level of phospho-FAK and MMP2, vimentin and N-cadherin in U87 cells.

Cell viability was tested by a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) kit; migration and invasion were checked by the scratching assay; apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry. The construction of plasmids and dual-luciferase reporter experiment were carried out to find the interaction site between FOXO1 and miR-506. Immunohistochemistry was done to check the protein level in tumors after the in vivo experiment. We found that the FOXO1-miR-506 axis suppresses GBM cell invasion and migration and promotes GBM chemosensitivity to TMZ, which was mediated by autophagy. FOXO1 upregulates miR-506 by binding to its promoter to enhance transcriptional activation. MiR-506 could downregulate E26 transformation-specific 1 (ETS1) expression by targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Interestingly, ETS1 promoted FOXO1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol and further suppressed the FOXO1-miR-506 axis in GBM cells. Consistently, both miR-506 inhibition and ETS1 overexpression could rescue FOXO1 overactivation-mediated TMZ chemosensitivity in mouse models. Our study demonstrated a negative feedback loop of FOXO1/miR-506/ETS1/FOXO1 in GBM in regulating invasiveness and chemosensitivity. Thus, the above axis might be a promising therapeutic target for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37551556
"""Semapimod sensitizes glioblastoma tumors to ionizing radiation by targeting microglia.""","""Glioblastoma is the most malignant and lethal form of astrocytoma, with patients having a median survival time of approximately 15 months with current therapeutic modalities. It is therefore important to identify novel therapeutics. There is mounting evidence that microglia (specialized brain-resident macrophages) play a significant role in the development and progression of glioblastoma tumors. In this paper we show that microglia, in addition to stimulating glioblastoma cell invasion, also promote glioblastoma cell proliferation and resistance to ionizing radiation in vitro. We found that semapimod, a drug that selectively interferes with the function of macrophages and microglia, potently inhibits microglia-stimulated GL261 invasion, without affecting serum-stimulated glioblastoma cell invasion. Semapimod also inhibits microglia-stimulated resistance of glioblastoma cells to radiation, but has no significant effect on microglia-stimulated glioblastoma cell proliferation. We also found that intracranially administered semapimod strongly increases the survival of GL261 tumor-bearing animals in combination with radiation, but has no significant benefit in the absence of radiation. In conclusion, our observations indicate that semapimod sensitizes glioblastoma tumors to ionizing radiation by targeting microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24816734

"""Three-dimensional invasion of human glioblastoma cells remains unchanged by X-ray and carbon ion irradiation in vitro.""","""Purpose: Cell invasion represents one of the major determinants that treatment has failed for patients suffering from glioblastoma. Contrary findings have been reported for cell migration upon exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, the migration and invasion capability of glioblastoma cells on and in collagen type I were evaluated upon irradiation with X-rays or carbon ions. Methods and materials: Migration on and invasion in collagen type I were evaluated in four established human glioblastoma cell lines exposed to either X-rays or carbon ions. Furthermore, clonogenic radiation survival, proliferation (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine positivity), DNA double-strand breaks (Î³H2AX/53BP1-positive foci), and expression of invasion-relevant proteins (eg, Î²1 integrin, FAK, MMP2, and MMP9) were explored. Migration and invasion assays for primary glioblastoma cells also were carried out with X-ray irradiation. Results: Neither X-ray nor carbon ion irradiation affected glioblastoma cell migration and invasion, a finding similarly observed in primary glioblastoma cells. Intriguingly, irradiated cells migrated unhampered, despite DNA double-strand breaks and reduced proliferation. Clonogenic radiation survival was increased when cells had contact with extracellular matrix. Specific inhibition of the Î²1 integrin or proliferation-associated signaling molecules revealed a critical function of JNK, PI3K, and p38 MAPK in glioblastoma cell invasion. Conclusions: These findings indicate that X-rays and carbon ion irradiation effectively reduce proliferation and clonogenic survival without modifying the migration and invasion ability of glioblastoma cells in a collagen type I environment. Addition of targeted agents against members of the MAPK and PI3K signaling axis to conventional chemoradiation therapy seems potentially useful to optimize glioblastoma therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22901381

In glioblastoma (GB), CLIC1 facilitates the G1/S phase transition and tightly regulates glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), a rare population of self-renewing CSCs with central roles in tumour resistance to therapy and tumour recurrence. CLIC1 is found as either a monomeric soluble protein or as a non-covalent dimeric protein that can form an ion channel. The ratio of dimeric to monomeric protein is altered in GSCs and depends on the cell redox state.

"""A novel splice variant of GLI1 that promotes glioblastoma cell migration and invasion.""","""The family of GLI zinc finger transcription factors regulates the expression of genes involved in many important cellular processes, notably embryonal development and cellular differentiation. The glioma-associated oncogene homologue 1 (GLI1) isoform, in particular, has attracted much attention because of its frequent activation in many human cancers and its interactions with other signaling pathways, such as those mediated by K-RAS, transforming growth factor-beta, epidermal growth factor receptor, and protein kinase A. Here, we report the identification of a novel truncated GLI1 splice variant, tGLI1, with an in-frame deletion of 123 bases (41 codons) spanning the entire exon 3 and part of exon 4 of the GLI1 gene. Expression of tGLI1 is undetectable in normal cells but is high in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other cancer cells. Although tGLI1 undergoes nuclear translocalization and transactivates GLI1-binding sites similar to GLI1, unlike GLI1, it is associated with increased motility and invasiveness of GBM cells. Using microarray analysis, we showed >100 genes to be differentially expressed in tGLI1-expressing compared with GLI1-expressing GBM cells, although both cell types expressed equal levels of known GLI1-regulated genes, such as PTCH1. We further showed one of the tGLI1 up-regulated genes, CD24, an invasion-associated gene, to be required for the migratory and invasive phenotype of GBM cells. These data provide conclusive evidence for a novel gain-of-function GLI1 splice variant that promotes migration and invasiveness of GBM cells and open up a new research paradigm on the role of the GLI1 pathway in malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19706761

Standard-of-care treatment involves maximal surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide [TMZ]). The 5-year survival rate of patients with GBM is <10%, a colossal failure that has been partially attributed to intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to TMZ through O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status in the tumor. Methods: A drug screening aimed at evaluating the potential recycling and repurposing of known drugs was conducted in TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines and primary cultures of newly diagnosed GBM with different MGMT promoter methylation status, phenotypic/genotypic background and subtype, and validated with sphere formation, cell migration assays, and quantitative invasive orthotopic in vivo models. Results: We identified hydroxyurea (HU) to synergize with TMZ in GBM cells in culture and in vivo, irrespective of MGMT promoter methylation status, subtype, and/or stemness. HU acts specifically on the S-phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting the M2 unit of enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Knockdown of this enzyme using RNA interference and other known chemical inhibitors exerted a similar effect to HU in combination with TMZ both in culture and in vivo. Conclusions: We demonstrate preclinical efficacy of repurposing hydroxyurea in combination with TMZ for adjuvant GBM therapy.

Treatment of glioma cells with nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), increased MMP-2 secretion and the capacity of cell invasion in U87MG cells. Addition of dexamethasone or ectopic expression of wild-type MKP-1 suppressed the SNP-stimulated MMP-2 activation and glioma cell invasiveness in U87MG cells.

In this study, we investigated the expression of HAI-2/PB in human gliomas in vivo and the effects of HAI-2/PB on the fibrinolytic and invasive capabilities of human glioblastoma cells in vitro. With RNA blot analysis, HAI-2/PB mRNA was expressed in normal brain and in low-grade astrocytomas, but was hardly detectable in anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, indicating that its expression levels were inversely correlated with the histological grade of human gliomas. To further explore the possible role of HAI-2/PB in glioma progression, cultured human glioblastoma cell lines (U251 and YKG-1) were transiently transfected with an expression vector harboring human HAI-2/PB cDNA. Subsequent analysis indicated that the expression of HAI-2/PB suppressed the fibrinolytic activities of both glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover, HAI-2/PB inhibited Matrigel invasion of U251 and YKG-1 cells by 30% and 64%, respectively. This anti-invasive effect appeared to be mediated primarily by the inhibitory activity of HAI-2/PB against the serine proteinase-dependent matrix degradation.

Re-expression of WNK2 in glioblastoma cells presenting WNK2 gene silencing reduced cell proliferation in vitro, tumour growth in vivo and also cell migration and invasion, an effect correlated with reduced activation of Rac1. In contrast, when endogenous WNK2 was depleted from glioblastoma cells with unmethylated WNK2 promoter, changes in cell morphology, an increase in invasion and activation of Rac1 were observed. Together, these results validate the WNK2 gene as a recurrent target for epigenetic silencing in glia-derived brain tumours and provide first mechanistic evidence for a tumour-suppressing role of WNK2 that is related to Rac1 signalling and tumour cell invasion and proliferation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23035050

Clinically, GBM metastasis rarely happen, but unexpectedly most human GBM tumor cell lines intrinsically possess metastatic potential. We used an experimental lung metastasis assay (ELM) to enrich for metastatic cells and three of four commonly used GBM lines were highly metastatic after repeated ELM selection (M2). These GBM-M2 lines grew more aggressively orthotopically and all showed dramatic multifold increases in IL6, IL8, MCP-1 and GM-CSF expression, cytokines and factors that are associated with GBM and poor prognosis. DBM2 cells, which were derived from the DBTRG-05MG cell line were used to test the efficacy of 17AAG for treatment of intracranial tumors. The DMB2 orthotopic xenografts form highly invasive tumors with areas of central necrosis, vascular hyperplasia and intracranial dissemination. In addition, the orthotopic tumors caused osteolysis and the skull opening correlated to the tumor size, permitting the use of real-time ultrasound imaging to evaluate antitumor drug activity.

In this review, we address mechanisms of angiogenesis, including unique features in GBMs, and resistance to anti-VEGF therapies frequently observed in GBM. Enhanced invasiveness is one such resistance mechanism and recent works report the contribution of activated MET signaling induced by inhibition of VEGF signaling. On the other hand, tumor cell-originated neovascularization including tumor-derived endothelial cell-induced angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry has been suggested to be involved in the resistance to anti-VEGF therapy.

Here, we discuss 3 ideas about how the microenvironment, consisting of a vasculature, inflammatory cells, immune cells, growth factors, and extracellular matrix, might provide therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM) in the context of radiotherapy (RT): (1) viable therapeutic targets exist in the GBM microenvironment, (2) RT alters the microenvironment of tissues and tumors; and (3) a potential benefit may be achieved by targeting the microenvironments induced by RT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19464631
"""A novel tool to analyze MRI recurrence patterns in glioblastoma.""","""At least 10% of glioblastoma relapses occur at distant and even contralateral locations. This disseminated growth limits surgical intervention and contributes to neurological morbidity. Preclinical data pointed toward a role for temozolomide (TMZ) in reducing radiotherapy-induced glioma cell invasiveness. Our objective was to develop and validate a new analysis tool of MRI data to examine the clinical recurrence pattern of glioblastomas. MRIcro software was used to map the location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of 63 patients in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981/22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) CE.3 study into the same stereotaxic space. This allowed us to examine changes of site and distance between the initial and the recurrent tumor on the group level. Thirty of the 63 patients were treated using radiotherapy, while the other patients completed a radiotherapy-plus-TMZ treatment. Baseline characteristics (median age, KPS) and outcome data (progression-free survival, overall survival) of the patients included in this analysis resemble those of the general study cohort. The patient groups did not differ in the promoter methylation status of methyl guanine methyltransferase (MGMT). Overall frequency of distant recurrences was 20%. Analysis of recurrence patterns revealed no difference between the groups in the size of the recurrent tumor or in the differential effect on the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location. The data show the feasibility of groupwise recurrence pattern analysis. An effect of TMZ treatment on the recurrence pattern in the EORTC 26981/22981/NCIC CE.3 study could not be demonstrated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18676355
"""Post-translational Modifications of OLIG2 Regulate Glioma Invasion through the TGF-beta Pathway.""","""In glioblastoma, invasion and proliferation are presumed to be mutually exclusive events; however, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this switch at the cellular level remain elusive. Previously, we have shown that phospho-OLIG2, a central-nervous-system-specific transcription factor, is essential for tumor growth and proliferation. Here, we show that the modulation of OLIG2 phosphorylation can trigger a switch between proliferation and invasion. Glioma cells with unphosphorylated OLIG2(S10, S13, S14) are highly migratory and invasive, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, unphosphorylated OLIG2 induces TGF-Î²2 expression and promotes invasive mesenchymal properties in glioma cells. Inhibition of the TGF-Î²2 pathway blocks this OLIG2-dependent invasion. Furthermore, ectopic expression of phosphomimetic Olig2 is sufficient to block TGF-Î²2-mediated invasion and reduce expression of invasion genes (ZEB1 and CD44). Our results not only provide a mechanistic insight into how cells switch from proliferation to invasion but also offer therapeutic opportunities for inhibiting dissemination of gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27396340
"""Synthetic emmprin peptides inhibit tumor cell-fibroblast interaction-stimulated upregulation of MMP-2 and tumor cell invasion.""","""Stromal cells are the main source of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human carcinoma tissues. Emmprin is a glycosylated transmembrane protein containing two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that is expressed in carcinoma cells and stimulates MMP production by adjacent stromal cells. The first Ig domain (ECI) of emmprin contains the biologically active site. We investigated whether synthetic peptides carrying a partial ECI sequence could inhibit emmprin activity. Only the second peptide (emp#2), which contains a putative N-glycosylation site sequence, inhibited emmprin-stimulated production of MMP-2 in co-cultures of fibroblasts and several different human tumor cells types, including carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, leukemia and glioma cells. Moreover, emp#2 significantly inhibited the invasive activity of glioblastoma cells promoted by interaction with fibroblasts. Perturbation of emmprin activity by this peptide may have potential therapeutic uses in the prevention of MMP-2-dependent cancer invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21637915
"""RhoA regulates translation of the Nogo-A decoy SPARC in white matter-invading glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas strongly invade the brain by infiltrating into the white matter along myelinated nerve fiber tracts even though the myelin protein Nogo-A prevents cell migration by activating inhibitory RhoA signaling. The mechanisms behind this long-known phenomenon remained elusive so far, precluding a targeted therapeutic intervention. This study demonstrates that the prevalent activation of AKT in gliomas increases the ER protein-folding capacity and enables tumor cells to utilize a side effect of RhoA activation: the perturbation of the IRE1Î±-mediated decay of SPARC mRNA. Once translation is initiated, glioblastoma cells rapidly secrete SPARC to block Nogo-A from inhibiting migration via RhoA. By advanced ultramicroscopy for studying single-cell invasion in whole, undissected mouse brains, we show that gliomas require SPARC for invading into white matter structures. SPARC depletion reduces tumor dissemination that significantly prolongs survival and improves response to cytostatic therapy. Our finding of a novel RhoA-IRE1 axis provides a druggable target for interfering with SPARC production and underscores its therapeutic value.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31062076
"""Local detection of microvessels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma using relative cerebral blood volume: an imaging marker useful for astrocytoma grade 4 classification.""","""Background: The microvessels area (MVA), derived from microvascular proliferation, is a biomarker useful for high-grade glioma classification. Nevertheless, its measurement is costly, labor-intense, and invasive. Finding radiologic correlations with MVA could provide a complementary non-invasive approach without an extra cost and labor intensity and from the first stage. This study aims to correlate imaging markers, such as relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), and local MVA in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and to propose this imaging marker as useful for astrocytoma grade 4 classification. Methods: Data from 73 tissue blocks belonging to 17 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and 7 blocks from 2 IDH-mutant astrocytomas were compiled from the Ivy GAP database. MRI processing and rCBV quantification were carried out using ONCOhabitats methodology. Histologic and MRI co-registration was done manually with experts' supervision, achieving an accuracy of 88.8% of overlay. Spearman's correlation was used to analyze the association between rCBV and microvessel area. Mann-Whitney test was used to study differences of rCBV between blocks with presence or absence of microvessels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as well as to find differences with IDH-mutant astrocytoma samples. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between rCBV and microvessel area in the IDH-wildtype blocks (p < 0.001), as well as significant differences in rCBV were found between blocks with microvascular proliferation and blocks without it (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant differences in rCBV were found between IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and IDH-mutant astrocytoma samples, being 2-2.5 times higher rCBV values in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma samples. Conclusions: The proposed rCBV marker, calculated from diagnostic MRIs, can detect in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma those regions with microvessels from those without it, and it is significantly correlated with local microvessels area. In addition, the proposed rCBV marker can differentiate the IDH mutation status, providing a complementary non-invasive method for high-grade glioma classification.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34991512
"""RSK2 activity mediates glioblastoma invasiveness and is a potential target for new therapeutics.""","""In glioblastoma (GBM), infiltration of primary tumor cells into the normal tissue and dispersal throughout the brain is a central challenge to successful treatment that remains unmet. Indeed, patients respond poorly to the current therapies of tumor resection followed by chemotherapy with radiotherapy and have only a 16-month median survival. It is therefore imperative to develop novel therapies. RSK2 is a kinase that regulates proliferation and adhesion and can promote metastasis. We demonstrate that active RSK2 regulates GBM cell adhesion and is essential for cell motility and invasion of patient-derived GBM neurospheres. RSK2 control of adhesion and migration is mediated in part by its effects on integrin-Filamin A complexes. Importantly, inhibition of RSK2 by either RSK inhibitors or shRNA silencing impairs invasion and combining RSK2 inhibitors with temozolomide improves efficacy in vitro. In agreement with the in vitro data, using public datasets, we find that RSK2 is significantly upregulated in vivo in human GBM patient tumors, and that high RSK2 expression significantly correlates with advanced tumor stage and poor patient survival. Together, our data provide strong evidence that RSK inhibitors could enhance the effectiveness of existing GBM treatment, and support RSK2 targeting as a promising approach for novel GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27829215
"""Prognostic significance of c-Met expression in glioblastomas.""","""Background: The authors investigated whether expression of c-Met protein in glioblastomas is associated with overall survival and biologic features representing tumor invasiveness in patients with glioblastomas. Methods: Paraffin-embedded specimens of glioblastomas from 62 patients treated in a single institution were assessed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of c-Met expression. On the basis of the clinical data for these patients, the association between c-Met expression and clinicobiologic features representing tumor invasiveness was analyzed. Results: c-Met overexpression was detected in 29.0% (18 of 62) of glioblastomas. In patients with c-Met overexpression, the median survival was 11.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 9.9 months-13.5 months), compared with a median survival of 14.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 months-21.0 months) for patients whose tumors had no or little expression of c-Met (P=.031). On the radiographic analysis, 9 of 18 patients (50%) with tumors overexpressing c-Met demonstrated invasive and multifocal lesions on the initial magnetic resonance images, whereas only 9 of 44 patients (20.5%) with tumors that expressed no or little c-Met demonstrated these features (P=.030). Using immunohistochemistry, we also found a significant association between c-Met expression and matrix metalloproteinase-2,-9 (P=.020 and P=.013). Furthermore, Myc overexpression was found to be closely correlated with c-Met overexpression on IHC analysis (P=.004). Conclusions: The authors suggest that c-Met overexpression is associated with shorter survival time and poor treatment response in glioblastomas, the mechanism for which is elevated tumor invasiveness on the molecular and clinical phenotypes. This implies that more effective therapeutic strategies targeting c-Met receptors may have important clinical implication.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973197
"""Differentiation between glioblastomas and solitary brain metastases using diffusion tensor imaging.""","""The purpose of this study is to determine whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics including tensor shape measures such as linear and planar anisotropy coefficients (CL and CP) can help differentiate glioblastomas from solitary brain metastases. Sixty-three patients with histopathologic diagnosis of glioblastomas (22 men, 16 women, mean age 58.4 years) and brain metastases (13 men, 12 women, mean age 56.3 years) were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), CL and CP maps were co-registered and each lesion was semi-automatically subdivided into four regions: central, enhancing, immediate peritumoral and distant peritumoral. DTI metrics as well as the normalized signal intensity from the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were measured from each region. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the best model for classification. The results demonstrated that FA, CL and CP from glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases from all segmented regions (p<0.05), and the differences from the enhancing regions were most significant (p<0.001). FA and CL from the enhancing region had the highest prediction accuracy when used alone with an area under the curve of 0.90. The best logistic regression model included three parameters (ADC, FA and CP) from the enhancing part, resulting in 92% sensitivity, 100% specificity and area under the curve of 0.98. We conclude that DTI metrics, used individually or combined, have a potential as a non-invasive measure to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18951985
"""CD73 Promotes Glioblastoma Pathogenesis and Enhances Its Chemoresistance via A(2B) Adenosine Receptor Signaling.""","""Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the deadliest brain cancers to afflict humans, and it has a very poor survival rate even with treatment. The extracellular adenosine-generating enzyme CD73 is involved in many cellular functions that can be usurped by tumors, including cell adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. We set out to determine the role of CD73 in GB pathogenesis. To do this, we established a unique GB mouse model (CD73-FLK) in which we spatially expressed CD73 on endothelial cells in CD73-/- mice. This allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of host CD73 versus GB-expressed CD73 by comparing GB pathogenesis in WT, CD73-/-, and CD73-FLK mice. GB in CD73-/- mice had decreased tumor size, decreased tumor vessel density, and reduced tumor invasiveness compared with GB in WT mice. Interestingly, GBs in CD73-FLK mice were much more invasive and caused complete distortion of the brain morphology. We showed a 20-fold upregulation of A2B AR on GB compared with sham, and its activation induced matrix metalloproteinase-2, which enhanced GB pathogenesis. Inhibition of A2B AR signaling decreased multidrug resistance transporter protein expression, including permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Further, we showed that blockade of A2B AR signaling potently increased GB cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Together, these findings suggest that CD73 and A2B AR play a multifaceted role in GB pathogenesis and progression and that targeting the CD73-A2B AR axis can benefit GB patients and inform new approaches for therapy to treat GB patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glioblastoma (GB) is the most devastating primary brain tumor. GB patients' median survival is 16 months even with treatment. It is critical that we develop prophylaxes to advance GB treatment and improve patient survival. CD73-generated adenosine has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but its role in GB was not ascertained. Here, we demonstrated that host CD73 plays a prominent role in multiple areas of glioblastoma pathogenesis, including promoting GB growth, its angiogenesis, and its invasiveness. We found a 20-fold increase in A2B adenosine receptor (AR) expression on GB compared with sham, and its inhibition increased GB chemosensitivity to temozolomide. These findings strongly indicate that blockade or inhibition of CD73 and the A2B AR are prime targets for future GB therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30926752
"""Galectins as Emerging Glyco-Checkpoints and Therapeutic Targets in Glioblastoma.""","""Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the adult population, urging identification of new rational therapeutic targets. Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, are highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and delineate prognosis and clinical outcome in patients with GBM. These endogenous lectins play key roles in different hallmarks of cancer by modulating tumor cell proliferation, oncogenic signaling, migration, vascularization and immunity. Additionally, they have emerged as mediators of resistance to different anticancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapy. Particularly in GBM, galectins control tumor cell transformation and proliferation, reprogram tumor cell migration and invasion, promote vascularization, modulate cell death pathways, and shape the tumor-immune landscape by targeting myeloid, natural killer (NK), and CD8+ T cell compartments. Here, we discuss the role of galectins, particularly galectin-1, -3, -8, and -9, as emerging glyco-checkpoints that control different mechanisms associated with GBM progression, and discuss possible therapeutic opportunities based on inhibition of galectin-driven circuits, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008740
"""Downregulation of Akt and FAK phosphorylation reduces invasion of glioblastoma cells by impairment of MT1-MMP shuttling to lamellipodia and downregulates MMPs expression.""","""Human malignant glioblastomas are highly invasive tumors. Increased cell motility and degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix are essential for tumor invasion. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway emerges as a common pathway regulating cellular proliferation, migration and invasion; however, its contribution to particular process and downstream cascades remain poorly defined. We have previously demonstrated that Cyclosporin A (CsA) affects glioblastoma invasion in organotypic brain slices and tumorigenicity in mice. Here we show that CsA impairs migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells by downregulation of Akt phosphorylation. Interference with PI-3K/Akt signaling was crucial for CsA effect on invasion, because overexpression of constitutively active myr-Akt antagonized drug action. Furthermore, the drug was not effective in T98G glioblastoma cells with constitutively high level of phosphorylated Akt. CsA, comparably to pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling (LY294002, A443654), reduced motility of glioblastoma cells, diminished MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity and MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression. The latter effect was mimicked by overexpression of dominant negative Akt mutants. We demonstrate that CsA and LY294002 reduced MMP transcription partly via modulation of IÎºB phosphorylation and NFÎºB transcriptional activity. Those effects were not mediated by inhibition of calcineurin, a classical CsA target. Additionally, CsA reduced phosphorylation and activity of focal adhesion kinase that was associated with rapid morphological alterations, rearrangement of lamellipodia and impairment of MT1-MMP translocation to membrane protrusions. Our results document novel, Akt-dependent mechanisms of interference with motility/invasion of human glioblastoma cells: through a rapid modulation of cell adhesion and MT1-MMP translocation to membrane protrusions and delayed, partly NFÎºB-dependent, downregulation of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression.

"""Establishment and Characterization of a Tumor Stem Cell-Based Glioblastoma Invasion Model.""","""Aims: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. Recurrence is inevitable and most likely connected to tumor invasion and presence of therapy resistant stem-like tumor cells. The aim was therefore to establish and characterize a three-dimensional in vivo-like in vitro model taking invasion and tumor stemness into account. Methods: Glioblastoma stem cell-like containing spheroid (GSS) cultures derived from three different patients were established and characterized. The spheroids were implanted in vitro into rat brain slice cultures grown in stem cell medium and in vivo into brains of immuno-compromised mice. Invasion was followed in the slice cultures by confocal time-lapse microscopy. Using immunohistochemistry, we compared tumor cell invasion as well as expression of proliferation and stem cell markers between the models. Results: We observed a pronounced invasion into brain slice cultures both by confocal time-lapse microscopy and immunohistochemistry. This invasion closely resembled the invasion in vivo. The Ki-67 proliferation indexes in spheroids implanted into brain slices were lower than in free-floating spheroids. The expression of stem cell markers varied between free-floating spheroids, spheroids implanted into brain slices and tumors in vivo. Conclusion: The established invasion model kept in stem cell medium closely mimics tumor cell invasion into the brain in vivo preserving also to some extent the expression of stem cell markers. The model is feasible and robust and we suggest the model as an in vivo-like model with a great potential in glioma studies and drug discovery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27454178

To identify mechanisms underlying glioblastoma invasion and motility, we used Transwell invasion chambers to select for a more potently invasive subpopulation of U87MG human glioblastoma cells. The stable population of tumor cells (U87-C1) obtained through this in vitro selection process were three times more invasive than parental U87MG cells and demonstrated faster monolayer wound healing and enhanced radial motility from cell spheroids. This enhanced invasiveness was associated with an 80% increase in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) activation. No differences in expression levels of pro-MMP-2, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase I (MT1-MMP), or integrin alphavbeta3 (mediators of MMP-2 activation) were detected. However, U87-C1 cells exhibited two-fold elevation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 mRNA and protein relative to parental cells. Exogenous addition of comparable levels of purified TIMP-2 to parental U87MG cells increased MMP-2 activation and invasion. Similarly, U87MG cells engineered to overexpress TIMP-2 at the same levels as U87-C1 cells also demonstrated increased MMP-2 activation, indicating that an increase in physiological levels of TIMP-2 can promote MMP-2 activation and invasion in glioblastoma cells. However, exogenous administration or recombinant overexpression of higher amounts of TIMP-2 in U87MG cells resulted in inhibition of MMP-2 activation. These results demonstrate that the complex balance between TIMP-2 and MMP-2 is a critical determinant of glioblastoma invasion, and indicate that increasing TIMP-2 in glioblastoma patients may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in tumors containing high levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14631378

Expression of the epithelial stem cell marker Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) has been described in GBM, but its functional role has not been conclusively elucidated. Here, we have investigated the role of LGR5 in a large repository of patient-derived GBM stem cell (GSC) cultures. The consequences of LGR5 overexpression or depletion have been analyzed using in vitro and in vivo methods, which showed that, among those with highest LGR5 expression (LGR5high ), there were two phenotypically distinct groups: one that was dependent on LGR5 for its malignant properties and another that was unaffected by changes in LGR5 expression. The LGR5-responding cultures could be identified by their significantly higher self-renewal capacity as measured by extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA), and these LGR5high -ELDAhigh cultures were also significantly more malignant and invasive compared to the LGR5high -ELDAlow cultures. This showed that LGR5 expression alone would not be a strict marker of LGR5 responsiveness. In a search for additional biomarkers, we identified LPAR4, CCND2, and OLIG2 that were significantly upregulated in LGR5-responsive GSC cultures, and we found that OLIG2 together with LGR5 were predictive of GSC radiation and drug response.

Despite advances in treatment modalities, tumor recurrence is common, seen mainly in the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ). We aimed to molecularly characterize PBZ, to understand the pathobiology of tumor recurrence. Methods/patients: We selected eight differentially regulated genes from our previous transcriptome profiling study on tumor core and PBZ. Expression of selected genes were validated in GBM (tumor core and PBZ, n = 37) and control (n = 22) samples by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Serine protease inhibitor clade A, member 3 (SERPINA3) was selected for further functional characterization in vitro by gene knockdown approach in glioma cells. Its protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was correlated with other clinically relevant GBM markers, patient prognosis and tumor recurrence. Results: The mRNA expression of selected genes from the microarray data validated in tumor core and PBZ and was similar to publicly available databases. SERPINA3 knock down in vitro showed decreased tumor cell proliferation, invasion, migration, transition to mesenchymal phenotype, stemness and radioresistance. SERPINA3 protein expression was higher in PBZ compared to tumor core and also was higher in older patients, IDH wild type and recurrent tumors.

Myricetin is a natural flavonoid with potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, which may serve as a potential and harmless agent for GBM treatment. Methods: To investigate the anti-glioblastoma effects of myricetin, GBM cells were treated with myricetin alone or in combination with temozolomide. Its effects on GBM cell motility and cytoskeletal structures including lamellipodia, focal adhesions and membrane ruffles were also evaluated. Results: We showed that myricetin alone inhibited glioblastoma U-87 MG cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas combination of myricetin and temozolomide did not exhibit any synergistic effect. The inhibitory effect on GBM cell proliferation is independent of PTEN status. Moreover, myricetin showed less cytotoxicity to normal astrocytes than GBM cells. Formation of lamellipodia, focal adhesions, membrane ruffles and vasculogenic mimicry were blocked by myricetin, and phosphorylation of ROCK2, paxillin and cortactin was suppressed. In addition, myricetin could inhibit PI3K/Akt and JNK signaling, and bind to a series of kinases and scaffold proteins including PI3K catalytic isoforms (p110Î±, p110Î² and p110Î´), PDK1, JNK, c-Jun, ROCK2, paxillin, vinculin and VEcadherin.

Filter-based assays also permit rapid, quantitative assessment of the in vitro migratory and invasive potential of tumor cells. Scoring migration has relied on visual counting of stained cells which appear on the underside of the filter and determining a true percentage score involves arduous counting of cells on both filter surfaces. Visual counting of random fields may be unreliable, and counting all fields is laborious. In the present study we developed and compared two alternative methods for scoring cell numbers in filter-based assays, a colorimetric assay of toluidine blue binding, and a radioassay of cells prelabeled with [3H]thymidine. Each method was evaluated for sensitivity, variability, ease of use and efficiency, and suitability for use in assays of cell migration and invasion. The radiolabeling method proved to be sensitive and reliable and was the most efficient technique. Although less sensitive and specific, the colorimetric dye method offered a rapid and reliable, nonradioactive alternative with the distinct advantage of preserving intact cultures for follow-up visual assessments. We conclude that colorimetric and radiolabel scoring of filter-based assays are reliable and efficient semiautomated methods which provide means to obtain more complete assessments of cell migration and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8297001
"""MSI1 associates glioblastoma radioresistance via homologous recombination repair, tumor invasion and cancer stem-like cell properties.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain malignancy in adults, and currently available GBM treatments present several unique challenges. It is known that GBM involves cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and tumor cells that aggressively invade normal brain tissues, and both cell types may cause resistance to radiotherapy (RT) and are thus responsible for therapeutic failure. The radioresistance of GBM cells relies on the efficient activation of the DNA damage response (DDR), but the mechanisms linking this response with stem-cell status and tumor invasion remain unclear. Materials and methods: We used irradiation to treat patient-derived GBM (Par) cells and then purified radioresistant GBM (R2M2) cells through two rounds of irradiation and an invasion assay. Musashi-1 (MSI1) is a neural stem-cell marker and key oncogenic factor of GBM. We identified MSI1 expression to predict radioresistance through silencing an MSI1-high-expressing R2M2 cell line or inducing overexpression in a Par cell line with low/no MSI1 expression and assessing the subsequent DDR. Result: MSI1 enhances tumor invasion via VCAM1 and modulates GBM radioresistance via the hyperactivation of the DDR through increasing homologous recombination repair and evading apoptosis. MSI1 knockdown induces DNA damage accumulation in irradiated GBM cells and promotes their depletion in vitro; MSI1 knockdown also inhibits the formation of GBMs generated by irradiated xeno-transplanted cells. MSI1 inhibition may radiosensitize tumors, prevent CSC-positive selection induced by RT, and reduce tumor invasion. Conclusion: MSI1 may involve in regulating GBM radioresistance, invasion, and recurrence and could be a novel target for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30322656
"""Adenosine Depletion as A New Strategy to Decrease Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells Aggressiveness.""","""Glioblastoma is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis. This is mainly due to a cell subpopulation with an extremely aggressive potential, called glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). These cells produce high levels of extracellular adenosine, which are increased even more under hypoxic conditions. Under hypoxia, adenosine signaling is related to HIF-2Î± expression, enhancing cell aggressiveness. Adenosine can be degraded using recombinant adenosine deaminase (ADA) to revert its pathological effects. The aim of this study was to degrade adenosine using ADA in order to decrease malignancy of GSCs. Adenosine depletion was performed using recombinant ADA. Migration and invasion were measured by transwell and matrigel-coated transwell assay, respectively. HIF-2Î±-dependent cell migration/invasion decreased in GSCs treated with ADA under hypoxia. MRPs-mediated chemoresistance and colony formation decreased in treatment with ADA. In conclusion, adenosine depletion using adenosine deaminase decreases GSCs aggressiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31671624
"""Extracellular Vesicles in Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are highly aggressive primary brain tumors. Complex and dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the sustained growth, proliferation, and invasion of GBM. Several means of intercellular communication have been documented between glioma cells and the TME, including growth factors, cytokines, chemokines as well as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs carry functional genomic and proteomic cargo from their parental cells and deliver that information to surrounding and distant recipient cells to modulate their behavior. EVs are emerging as crucial mediators of establishment and maintenance of the tumor by modulating the TME into a tumor promoting system. Herein we review recent literature in the context of GBM TME and the means by which EVs modulate tumor proliferation, reprogram metabolic activity, induce angiogenesis, escape immune surveillance, acquire drug resistance and undergo invasion. Understanding the multifaceted roles of EVs in the niche of GBM TME will provide invaluable insights into understanding the biology of GBM and provide functional insights into the dynamic EV-mediated intercellular communication during gliomagenesis, creating new opportunities for GBM diagnostics and therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32038644
"""Tumor suppressor miR-181c attenuates proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal abilities in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is well known for its aggressiveness, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear, limiting the treatment. In the present study, we showed that miR-181c, a commonly downregulated miRNA in GBM reported by several miRNA profiles, was associated with the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and predicted the outcome for patients from a GBM cohort (n=518) obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A multivariate analysis showed that miR-181c was an independent prognostic indicator for GBM patients. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that miR-181c was expressed poorly in neurospheres of glioma cells that resemble glioma stem cells. Proliferation and invasion assays showed that miR-181c also blocked the proliferation and invasion abilities of glioma cells. Limiting dilution and colony formation assays showed that miR-181c attenuated the self-renewal ability of glioma cells. Finally, investigation of the mechanism defined Notch2, a key molecular of Notch signaling, as the functional downstream target of miR-181c. An inverse correlation was found between miR-181c and Notch2 in glioma cells and verified in fresh glioma samples. Taken together, the present study showed that miR-181c can be considered a valuable indicator for the outcome of GBM patients. miR-181c acts as a tumor suppressor that attenuates proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal capacities by downregulation of Notch2 in glioma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25494473
"""The protein kinase LKB1 promotes self-renewal and blocks invasiveness in glioblastoma.""","""The role of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in glioblastoma (GBM) development remains poorly understood. LKB1 may regulate GBM cell metabolism and has been suggested to promote glioma invasiveness. After analyzing LKB1 expression in GBM patient mRNA databases and in tumor tissue via multiparametric immunohistochemistry, we observed that LKB1 was localized and enriched in GBM tumor cells that co-expressed SOX2 and NESTIN stemness markers. Thus, LKB1-specific immunohistochemistry can potentially reveal subpopulations of stem-like cells, advancing GBM patient molecular pathology. We further analyzed the functions of LKB1 in patient-derived GBM cultures under defined serum-free conditions. Silencing of endogenous LKB1 impaired 3D-gliomasphere frequency and promoted GBM cell invasion in vitro and in the zebrafish collagenous tail after extravasation of circulating GBM cells. Moreover, loss of LKB1 function revealed mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased ATP levels. Treatment with the clinically used drug metformin impaired 3D-gliomasphere formation and enhanced cytotoxicity induced by temozolomide, the primary chemotherapeutic drug against GBM. The IC50 of temozolomide in the GBM cultures was significantly decreased in the presence of metformin. This combinatorial effect was further enhanced after LKB1 silencing, which at least partially, was due to increased apoptosis. The expression of genes involved in the maintenance of tumor stemness, such as growth factors and their receptors, including members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, was suppressed after LKB1 silencing. The defect in gliomasphere growth caused by LKB1 silencing was bypassed after supplementing the cells with exogenous PFDGF-BB. Our data support the parallel roles of LKB1 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, 3D-gliomasphere survival, and hindering migration in GBM. Thus, the natural loss of, or pharmacological interference with LKB1 function, may be associated with benefits in patient survival but could result in tumor spread.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34350982
"""Imaging the impact of Nox4 in cycling hypoxia-mediated U87 glioblastoma invasion and infiltration.""","""Purpose: We determined the impact of the cycling hypoxia tumor microenvironment on tumor cell invasion and infiltration in U87 human glioblastoma cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms using molecular bio-techniques and imaging. Procedures: The invasive phenotype of U87 cells and xenografts exposed to experimentally imposed cycling hypoxic stress in vitro and in vivo was determined by the matrigel invasion assay in vitro and dual optical reporter gene imaging in vivo. RNAi-knockdown technology was utilized to study the role of the NADPH oxidase subunit 4 (Nox4) on cycling hypoxia-mediated tumor invasion. Results: Cycling hypoxic stress significantly promoted tumor invasion in vitro and in vivo. However, Nox4 knockdown inhibited this effect. Nox4-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for cycling hypoxia-induced invasive potential in U87 cells through the activation of NF-ÎºB- and ERK-mediated stimulation of MMP-9.

Previous research has proved the pivotal role of the changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer cell invasion. Materials and methods: The mRNA expression of 40 ECM molecules was determined using qRT-PCR in 54 fresh-frozen glioblastoma and brain metastasis samples. Seventy-two samples were used to determine the levels of 20 ECM proteins. Results: The mRNA and protein expression pattern of the studied tumors differs greatly. Linear discriminant analysis of mRNA expression identified samples based on their mRNA expression profile with 92.3% probability and highlighted the role of some molecules as their level greatly influenced sample identification. Conclusion: Different tumor types with different invasiveness differ in the composition of their ECM and this can be used to identify samples.

"""Increased level of H19 long noncoding RNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells.""","""OBJECTIVE Increased levels of H19 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have been observed in many cancers, suggesting that overexpression of H19 may be important in the development of carcinogenesis. However, the role of H19 in human glioblastoma is still unclear. The object of this study was to examine the level of H19 in glioblastoma samples and investigate the role of H19 in glioblastoma carcinogenesis. METHODS Glioblastoma and nontumor brain tissue specimens were obtained from tissue obtained during tumor resection in 30 patients with glioblastoma. The level of H19 lncRNA was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The role of H19 in invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells was then investigated using commercially produced cell lines (U87 and U373). The effects of H19 overexpression on glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis were detected by in vitro Matrigel invasion and endothelial tube formation assay. The effects of H19 on glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity were investigated by neurosphere formation and an in vivo murine xenograft model. RESULTS The authors found that H19 is significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma tissues, and the level of expression was associated with patient survival. In the subsequent investigations, the authors found that overexpression of H19 promotes glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Interestingly, H19 was also significantly overexpressed in CD133+ glioblastoma cells, and overexpression of H19 was associated with increased neurosphere formation of glioblastoma cells. Finally, stable overexpression of H19 was associated with increased tumor growth in the murine xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that increased expression of H19 lncRNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, stemness, and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that H19 plays an important role in tumorigenicity and stemness of glioblastoma and thus could be a therapeutic target for treatment of glioblastoma in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28306408
"""Effects of Arginine and Its Deprivation on Human Glioblastoma Physiology and Signaling.""","""The observations that numerous cancers are characterized by impairment in arginine synthesis and that deficit of exogenous arginine specifically affects their growth and viability are the ground for arginine deprivation-based anticancer treatment strategy. This review addresses molecular mechanisms of the human glioblastoma cell response to arginine deprivation. Our earlier studies have shown that arginine deprivation specifically impairs glioblastoma cell motility, adhesion and invasiveness. These changes were evoked by alterations in the actin cytoskeleton organization resulting from a decreased arginylation of Î²-actin isoform. Moreover, deficit of arginine induces prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, not leading, however, to a massive apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Our current research indicates that cell death could be augmented by other compounds such as modulators of ER stress, for example arginine analogue of plant origin, canavanine. Implication of these studies on the development of new anti-glioma metabolic therapeutic modalities are discussed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32034717
"""MicroRNA-542-3p Suppresses Tumor Cell Invasion via Targeting AKT Pathway in Human Astrocytoma.""","""The molecular mechanism underlying constitutive activation of AKT signaling, which plays essential roles in astrocytoma progression, is not fully characterized. Increasing numbers of studies have reported that microRNAs are involved in the malignant behavior of astrocytoma cells via directly targeting multiple oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Here, we found that microRNA (miR)-542-3p expression was decreased in glioblastoma cell lines and astrocytoma tissues, and reduced levels of miR-542-3p expression correlated with high histopathological grades and poor prognosis of astrocytoma patients. Exogenous miR-542-3p suppressed glioblastoma cell invasion through not only targeting AKT1 itself but also directly down-regulating its two important upstream regulators, namely, integrin-linked kinase and PIK3R1. Notably, overexpressing miR-542-3p decreased AKT1 phosphorylation and directly and indirectly repressed nuclear translocation and transactivation activity of Î²-catenin to exert its anti-invasive effect. Furthermore, the miR-542-3p expression level negatively correlated with AKT activity as well as levels of integrin-linked kinase and PIK3R1 in human astrocytoma specimens. These findings suggest that miR-542-3p acts as a negative regulator in astrocytoma progression and that miR-542-3p down-regulation contributes to aberrant activation of AKT signaling, leaving open the possibility that miR-542-3p may be a potential therapeutic target for high grade astrocytoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26286747
"""Immunohistochemical analysis of reactive astrocytes around glioblastoma: an immunohistochemical study of postmortem glioblastoma cases.""","""To investigate the mechanisms of proteolysis within the glioma, and tissue reactions against glioblastoma, immunohistochemical detection both outside and inside of the tumor was performed using seven brains with glioblastoma that were obtained from autopsies. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1,-2,-9, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP), interleukin (IL)1-beta, and IL-6. The data were translated into color graphics and the localization of these proteins was analyzed. In glial cells around the tumor, GFAP, VEGF, MMP-2, and MT-MMP were strongly expressed. Moreover, IL1-beta was also expressed strongly in the glial cells at the periphery of the tumor. IL-6 was recognized outside of the tumor, but was expressed only in the swollen astrocytes and normal pyramidal cells. These data suggest that in the periphery of the tumor, tissue reconstruction processes take place with concomitant degradation of the matrix by MMP-2 and MT-MMP, as well as vascular remodeling promoted by VEGF. The fact that IL1-beta, but not IL-6, was expressed strongly in the glial cells around the tumor, may indicate that these proteins expressed outside of the tumor are not utilized for tumor growth, but may be used to guard the tumor against invasions, such as immune response.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11932042

This study was designed to discriminate tumor entities using normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity values (nVITS) obtained from pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL), combined with intratumoral susceptibility signals (ITSS) from susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Thirty consecutive patients with glioblastoma (n=22) and PCNSL (n=8), histologically classified according to the WHO brain tumor classification, were included. MRIs were acquired on a 3T scanner, and included PASL and SWI sequences. nVITS was defined by the signal intensity ratio between the tumor and the contralateral normal brain tissue, as obtained by PASL images. ITSS was determined as intratumoral low signal intensity structures detected on SWI sequences and were divided into four different grades. Potential differences in the nVITS and ITSS between glioblastomas and PCNSLs were revealed using statistical testing. To determine sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy, as well as an optimum cut-off value for the differentiation of PCNSL and glioblastoma, a receiver operating characteristic analysis was used. We found that nVITS (p=0.011) and ITSS (p=0.001) values were significantly higher in glioblastoma than in PCNSL. The optimal cut-off value for nVITS was 1.41 and 1.5 for ITSS, with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of more than 95%.

Functional enrichment showed that UGP2 was enriched in the biological progresses of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, UGP2 expression is aberrantly overexpressed in human glioma and positively correlated with pathologic grade. A loss-of-function study showed that knockdown of UGP2 decreases U251 cell growth, migration, and invasion in vivo and vitro.

"""Maximizing the extent of resection and survival benefit of patients in glioblastoma surgery: high-field iMRI versus conventional and 5-ALA-assisted surgery.""","""Aims: A safe total resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be the primary goal in the treatment of glioblastomas (GBMs) to enable patients the longest survival possible. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)- and intraoperative MRI (iMRI)-assisted surgery, have been shown in prospective randomized trials to significantly improve the extent of resection (EOR) and subsequently survival of patients with GBMs. No direct comparison of surgical results between both techniques has been published to date. We analyzed the additional value of iMRI in glioblastoma surgery compared to conventional surgery with and without 5-ALA. Methods: Residual tumor volumes, clinical parameters and 6-month progression-free survival (6M-PFS) rates after GBM resection were analyzed retrospectively for 117 patients after conventional, 5-ALA and iMRI-assisted surgery. Results: Mean residual tumor volume (range) after iMRI-assisted surgery [0.5 (0.0-4.7) cm(3)] was significantly smaller compared to the residual tumor volume after 5-ALA-guided surgery [1.9 (0.0-13.2) cm(3); p = .022], which again was significantly smaller than in conventional white-light surgery [4.7 (0.0-30.6) cm(3); p = .007]. Total resections were significantly more common in iMRI- (74%) than in 5-ALA-assisted (46%, p = .05) or white-light surgery (13%, p = .03). Improvement of the EOR by using iMRI was safely achievable as peri- and postoperative morbidities were comparable between cohorts. Total resections increased 6M-PFS from 32% to 45%. Conclusions: Analysis of residual tumor volumes, total resections and neurological outcomes demonstrate that iMRI may be significantly superior to 5-ALA and white-light surgery for glioblastomas at comparable peri- and postoperative morbidities.

"""Effects of radiation on a three-dimensional model of malignant glioma invasion.""","""An experimental model of malignant glioma growth involving implantation of spheroids into a gel matrix of collagen type I has been developed. This model has been used to characterize changes in glioma cell invasion in response to single dose and fractionated radiation treatment. Suspensions of C6 astrocytoma cells were grown in spinner culture flasks to yield spheroids of varying size (300-1000 microm). Implantation of spheroids into a gel matrix of collagen type I was associated with measurable invasion of the surrounding gel by individual tumor cells. Changes in the distance of invasion in response to single dose and fractionated radiation were measured. Changes in apoptosis and proliferative indices in different regions of the spheroids in response to radiation were also assessed. In unirradiated gels, maximum depth of invasion, 1300-1750 microm, was achieved by 5 days after implantation. A radiation dose-dependent inhibition of invasion was noted and was most profound for larger spheroids. Fractionation of the radiation dose was associated with a partial recovery of invasion. Changes in apoptotic and proliferative indices in response to radiation depended on the region of the spheroid examined. Increases in apoptosis were noted for cells at the surface of the spheroid and invading cells while cells at the centre of the spheroid demonstrated virtually no increase in apoptosis. Likewise, a dose-dependent decrease in proliferative indices following radiation was noted among the invading cells and cells at the surface of the spheroid but not at the centre of the spheroid. We have described a model of malignant glioma invasion which possesses many of the qualities of in vivo malignant gliomas. Within this model, invasion appeared to be inhibited by radiation in a dose- and fractionation-dependent fashion. Measurement of apoptotic and cell proliferation indices favour a direct cytotoxic effect on the invading cells as the most likely mechanism for this phenomenon.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10571424

The mRNA and protein levels of GNG5 and Yin Yang 1 (YY1) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot (WB). Detection of the glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP/ADP ratios were used to assess cell glycolysis. Besides, Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway-related protein levels were examined by WB. Mice xenograft model was also constructed to explore GNG5 roles in vivo. GNG5 was highly expressed in GBM, and its silencing inhibited GBM cell proliferation, invasion, stemness and glycolysis, while promoted apoptosis. Transcription factor YY1 could bind to the GNG5 promoter region and induce its expression. GNG5 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of YY1 silencing on GBM cell growth, invasion, stemness and glycolysis. YY1/GNG5 axis could activate the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway agonists SKL2001 could revert the effects of GNG5 silencing on GBM cell progression.

The zebrafish brain is a dynamic and complex environment providing an optimal setting for studying GBM cell progression.

Results: B7H3 expression by tumor and endothelial cells correlates with the grade of malignancy in gliomas and with poor survival. Both soluble 4IgB7H3 in the supernatant of glioma cells and cell-bound 4IgB7H3 are functional and suppress natural killer cell-mediated tumor cell lysis. Gene silencing showed that membrane and soluble 4IgB7H3 convey a proinvasive phenotype in glioma cells and glioma-initiating cells in vitro. These proinvasive and immunosuppressive properties were confirmed in vivo by xenografted 4IgB7H3 gene silenced glioma-initiating cells, which invaded significantly less into the surrounding brain tissue in an orthotopic model and by subcutaneously injected LN-229 cells, which were more susceptible to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity than unsilenced control cells. Conclusions: Because of its immunosuppressive and proinvasive function, 4IgB7H3 may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22080438
"""Simplified realistic human head model for simulating Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields).""","""Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are alternating electric fields in the intermediate frequency range (100-300 kHz) of low-intensity (1-3 V/cm). TTFields are an anti-mitotic treatment against solid tumors, which are approved for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients. These electric fields are induced non-invasively by transducer arrays placed directly on the patient's scalp. Cell culture experiments showed that treatment efficacy is dependent on the induced field intensity. In clinical practice, a software called NovoTalTM uses head measurements to estimate the optimal array placement to maximize the electric field delivery to the tumor. Computational studies predict an increase in the tumor's electric field strength when adapting transducer arrays to its location. Ideally, a personalized head model could be created for each patient, to calculate the electric field distribution for the specific situation. Thus, the optimal transducer layout could be inferred from field calculation rather than distance measurements. Nonetheless, creating realistic head models of patients is time-consuming and often needs user interaction, because automated image segmentation is prone to failure. This study presents a first approach to creating simplified head models consisting of convex hulls of the tissue layers. The model is able to account for anisotropic conductivity in the cortical tissues by using a tensor representation estimated from Diffusion Tensor Imaging. The induced electric field distribution is compared in the simplified and realistic head models. The average field intensities in the brain and tumor are generally slightly higher in the realistic head model, with a maximal ratio of 114% for a simplified model with reasonable layer thicknesses. Thus, the present pipeline is a fast and efficient means towards personalized head models with less complexity involved in characterizing tissue interfaces, while enabling accurate predictions of electric field distribution.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28269540
"""The complex role of eicosanoids in the brain: Implications for brain tumor development and therapeutic opportunities.""","""Eicosanoids are a family of bioactive lipids that play diverse roles in the normal physiology of the brain, including neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of cerebral blood flow. In the brain, eicosanoids are primarily derived from arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipids in response to various stimuli. Prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are the major classes of eicosanoids produced in the brain, and they act through specific receptors to modulate various physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulation of eicosanoids has been implicated in the development and progression of brain tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), meningioma, and medulloblastoma. Eicosanoids have been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. Particularly, PGE2 promotes GBM cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Understanding the role of eicosanoids in brain tumors can inform the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic strategies that target eicosanoid pathways. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the growth and invasiveness of GBM cells. Moreover, eicosanoids have immunomodulatory effects that can impact the immune response to brain tumors. Understanding the role of eicosanoids in the immune response to brain tumors can inform the development of immunotherapy approaches for these tumors. Overall, the complex role of eicosanoids in the brain underscores the importance of further research to elucidate their functions in normal physiology and disease, and highlights the potential for developing novel therapeutic approaches that target eicosanoid pathways in brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37488051
"""IL-17A promotes cell migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells via activation of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common of both benign and malignant primary brain tumours, in which the inflammatory and immunologic abnormalities are involved. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plays an important role in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. Several recent studies revealed that the expression of IL-17A was overexpressed in human GBMs tissue. However, the accurate role of IL-17A in GBMs remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of IL-17A on cell migration and invasion of GBMs and the mechanism by which the effects occurred. We found that exogenous IL-17A promoted significantly cell migration and invasion abilities in two GBMs cell lines (U87MG and U251) in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the protein expressions of PI3K, Akt and MMP-2/9 were increased in the GBMs cells challenged by IL-17A. Furthermore, a tight junction protein ZO-1 was down-regulated but Twist and Bmi1 were up-regulated. Treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) significantly reduced the abilities of both migration and invasion in U87MG and U251 cells. LY294002 treatment also attenuated the IL-17A causing increases of protein levels of PI3K, AKT, MMP-2/9, Twist and the decreases of protein level of ZO-1 in the U87MG and U251 cells. Taken together, we concluded that IL-17A promotes the GBM cells migration and invasion via PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. IL-17A and its related signalling pathways may be potential therapeutic targets for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30353649
"""Investigating Glioblastoma Multiforme Sub-Proteomes: A Computational Study of CUSA Fluid Proteomic Data.""","""Based on our previous proteomic study on Cavitating Ultrasound Aspirator (CUSA) fluid pools of Newly Diagnosed (ND) and Recurrent (R) glioblastomas (GBMs) of tumor core and periphery, as defined by 5-aminolevulinc acid (5-ALA) metabolite fluorescence, this work aims to apply a bioinformatic approach to investigate specifically into three sub-proteomes, i.e., Not Detected in Brain (NB), Cancer Related (CR) and Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) proteins following selected database classification. The study of these yet unexplored specific datasets aims to understand the high infiltration capability and relapse rate that characterizes this aggressive brain cancer. Out of the 587 proteins highly confidently identified in GBM CUSA pools, 53 proteins were classified as NB. Their gene ontology (GO) analysis showed the over-representation of blood coagulation and plasminogen activating cascade pathways, possibly compatible with Blood Brain Barrier damage in tumor disease and surgery bleeding. However, the NB group also included non-blood proteins and, specifically, histones correlated with oncogenesis. Concerning CR proteins, 159 proteins were found in the characterized GBM proteome. Their GO analysis highlighted the over-representation of many pathways, primarily glycolysis. Interestingly, while CR proteins were identified in ND-GBM exclusively in the tumor zones (fluorescence positive core and periphery zones) as predictable, conversely, in R-GBM they were unexpectedly characterized prevalently in the healthy zone (fluorescence negative tumor periphery). Relative to EVs protein classification, 60 proteins were found. EVs are over-released in tumor disease and are important in the transport of biological macromolecules. Furthermore, the presence of EVs in numerous body fluids makes them a possible low-invasive source of brain tumor biomarkers to be investigated. These results give new hints on the molecular features of GBM in trying to understand its aggressive behavior and open to more in-depth investigations to disclose potential disease biomarkers.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35216175
"""Selective suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human glioblastoma cells by antisense gene transfer impairs glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been associated with human glioblastoma tumor progression. In this study, we sought to down-regulate MMP-9 expression by stably transfecting a high-grade glioblastoma cell line with a plasmid vector capable of expressing an antisense transcript complementary to a 528-bp segment at the 5' end of human MMP-9 cDNA. Stable transfectants were obtained through selection with G418. Of the clones transfected with vector, sense, and antisense constructs, Northern blotting, Western blotting, and gelatin zymography showed that MMP-9 expression was significantly reduced only in the antisense-transfected cells. A Matrigel invasion assay revealed marked reductions in invasiveness for the antisense clones relative to the parental, vector, and sense clones. Cocultures of tumor spheroids and fetal rat brain aggregates showed that the antisense-transfected stable clones showed no invasion of the rat brain aggregates; in contrast, 90% of the parental, vector, and sense clones invaded the rat brain aggregates. Intracerebral injection of antisense stable transfectants in nude mice produced no tumors or very small tumors, but intracerebral injection of parental or vector clones did produce tumors. These results suggest that MMP-9 expression is essential for the invasiveness of glioblastoma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11156378

The expressions of miR-330-5p and ITGA5 mRNA in GBM cell lines (U87, U251, and U373) and normal brain glial cell line (HEB) were detected using RT-qPCR. Protein expression of ITGA5 was examined using Western blot. The present study used MTT assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay, wound healing assay, and flow cytometry analysis in order to determine the biological functions of GBM cells (including cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle). The present study applied dual-luciferase reporter gene assay to identify the target relationship between miR-330-5p and ITGA5. miR-330-5p was low-expressed in GBM cell lines while ITGA5 was high-expressed compared with HEB. miR-330-5p could directly target ITGA5 as well as suppress its expression in GBM cells. Up-regulation of miR-330-5p and down-regulation of ITGA5 both have an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Meanwhile, they could also promote GBM cell apoptosis. miR-330-5p could suppress proliferation and invasion of GBM cells through targeting ITGA5.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336765
"""Extracellular vesicles as source for the identification of minimally invasive molecular signatures in glioblastoma.""","""The analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a source of cancer biomarkers is an emerging field since low-invasive biomarkers are highly demanded. EVs constitute a heterogeneous population of small membrane-contained vesicles that are present in most of body fluids. They are released by all cell types, including cancer cells and their cargo consists of nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites and varies depending on the biological-pathological state of the secretory cell. Therefore, EVs are considered as a potential source of reliable biomarkers for cancer. EV biomarkers in liquid biopsy can be a valuable tool to complement current medical technologies for cancer diagnosis, as their sampling is minimally invasive and can be repeated over time to monitor disease progression. In this review, we highlight the advances in EV biomarker research for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring. We especially focus on EV derived biomarkers for glioblastoma. The diagnosis and monitoring of glioblastoma still relies on imaging techniques, which are not sufficient to reflect the highly heterogenous and invasive nature of glioblastoma.

"""A New Systemic Disease Mouse Model for Glioblastoma Capable of Single-Tumour-Cell Detection.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is characterised by extensive infiltration into the brain parenchyma, leading to inevitable tumor recurrence and therapeutic failure. Future treatments will need to target the specific biology of tumour recurrence, but our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited. Significantly, there is a lack of available methods and models that are tailored to the examination of tumour recurrence. Methods: NOD-SCID mice were orthotopically implanted with luciferase-labelled donor U87MG or MU20 glioblastoma cells. Four days later, an unlabelled recipient tumor was implanted on the contralateral side. The mice were euthanised at a humane end-point and tissue and blood samples were collected for ex vivo analyses. Results: The ex vivo analyses of the firefly-labelled MU20 tumours displayed extensive invasion at the primary tumour margins, whereas the firefly-labelled U87MG tumours exhibited expansive phenotypes with no evident invasions at the tumour margins. Luciferase signals were detected in the contralateral unlabelled recipient tumours for both the U87MG and MU20 tumours compared to the non-implanted control brain. Remarkably, tumour cells were uniformly detected in all tissue samples of the supratentorial brain region compared to the control tissue, with single tumour cells detected in some tissue samples. Circulating tumour cells were also detected in the blood samples of most of the xenografted mice. Moreover, tumour cells were detected in the lungs of all of the mice, a probable event related to haematogenous dissemination. Similar results were obtained when the U87MG cells were alternatively labelled with gaussian luciferase.

Filamins (FLNs) are a group of actin-binding proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton in cells. However, the role of FLNs in malignancies-particularly in GBM-is unclear. Methods: The relation between FLNC expression and overall survival in GBM was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis using GBM patients from the Kagoshima University Hospital (n = 90) and data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 153). To assess FLNC function in GBM, cell migration and invasion were examined with Transwell and Matrigel invasion assays using FLNC-overexpressing U251MG and LN299 GBM cells, and ShRNA-mediated FLNC knocked-down KNS81 and U87MG cells. The gelatin zymography assay was used to estimate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 activity. Results: In silico analysis of GBM patient data from TCGA and immunohistochemical analyses of clinical GBM specimens revealed that increased FLNC expression was associated with poor patient prognosis.

"""Fate mapping of human glioblastoma reveals an invariant stem cell hierarchy.""","""Human glioblastomas harbour a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells that drive tumorigenesis. However, the origin of intratumoural functional heterogeneity between glioblastoma cells remains poorly understood. Here we study the clonal evolution of barcoded glioblastoma cells in an unbiased way following serial xenotransplantation to define their individual fate behaviours. Independent of an evolving mutational signature, we show that the growth of glioblastoma clones in vivo is consistent with a remarkably neutral process involving a conserved proliferative hierarchy rooted in glioblastoma stem cells. In this model, slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, which in turn generates non-proliferative cells. We also identify rare 'outlier' clones that deviate from these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy facilitates the expansion of pre-existing drug-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. Finally, we show that functionally distinct glioblastoma stem cells can be separately targeted using epigenetic compounds, suggesting new avenues for glioblastoma-targeted therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28854171

However, the role of H19 in human glioblastoma is still unclear. The object of this study was to examine the level of H19 in glioblastoma samples and investigate the role of H19 in glioblastoma carcinogenesis. METHODS Glioblastoma and nontumor brain tissue specimens were obtained from tissue obtained during tumor resection in 30 patients with glioblastoma. The level of H19 lncRNA was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The role of H19 in invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells was then investigated using commercially produced cell lines (U87 and U373). The effects of H19 overexpression on glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis were detected by in vitro Matrigel invasion and endothelial tube formation assay. The effects of H19 on glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity were investigated by neurosphere formation and an in vivo murine xenograft model. RESULTS The authors found that H19 is significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma tissues, and the level of expression was associated with patient survival. In the subsequent investigations, the authors found that overexpression of H19 promotes glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Interestingly, H19 was also significantly overexpressed in CD133(+) glioblastoma cells, and overexpression of H19 was associated with increased neurosphere formation of glioblastoma cells. Finally, stable overexpression of H19 was associated with increased tumor growth in the murine xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that increased expression of H19 lncRNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, stemness, and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells.

Tetrandrine(Tet) is an active ingredient extracted from the root of the Chinese medicinal plant Stephania tetrandra, which has been proved with a wide range of pharmacological effects including anti-tumor. However, there are few studies regarding the effect of Tet on glioma. In this study, MTT and BrdU assays were employed to detect the effect of Tet on the proliferation of LN229 glioblastoma cells; flow cytometry was used to analyze the cycle distribution and apoptosis; plate cloning assay and soft agar colony formation assay were performed to study the colony formation ability of LN229 cells exposed to Tet; scratch assay and Transwell assay were conducted to detect the ability of migration and invasion; Western blot was adopted to the exploration of the molecular mechanism. The MTT and BrdU assays showed that Tet inhibited the proliferation of LN229 cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The plate cloning assay and soft agar colony formation assay showed that Tet weakened the colony formation of LN229 cells in vitro; cytometry assay showed that Tet blocked cells in the G_1 phase and promoted cell apoptosis; scratch and Transwell assays proved that Tet inhibited the migration and invasion of LN229 cells; Western blot results showed that Tet down-regulated the expression levels of CDK2, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, snail, slug, vimentin, and N-cadherin, while up-regulated the level of E-cadherin.

Methods and results: Herein, the therapeutic effect of AP1-ELP-KLAK was tested in advanced, and less curable glioblastoma cells with higher expression of IL-4R. Glioblastoma cell lines stably expressing different reporter systems i.e., caspase-3 sensor (surrogate marker for cellular apoptosis) or effluc/enhanced firefly luciferase (cellular viability) were established to measure cell death non-invasively. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of D54/effluc and U97MG/effluc treated with AP1-ELP-KLAK exhibited higher cell death up to 2~3-fold than the control. Treatment with AP1-ELP-KLAK resulted in time-dependent increase of caspase-3 sensor BLI activity in D54/C cells and D54/C tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous injection of AP1-ELP-KLAK dramatically reduced tumor growth by inducing cellular apoptosis in D54/effluc tumor-bearing mice.

Cell adhesion molecules of the cadherin family are involved in cell migration and are known as master regulators of epithelial tumor invasiveness, but their role in glioblastoma is less understood. In particular, we recently demonstrated, in the syngeneic murine model, the occurrence of a previously undescribed cadherin switch between Cdh2 and Cdh4 during gliomagenesis, which is necessary for the acquisition of the highly infiltrative and tumorigenic phenotype of these cells. In the present study, we tested the role of Cdh4 in human gliomas. Our results on patient-derived glioma cells demonstrate a positive correlation between Cdh4 expression levels and the loss of cell-cell contact inhibition of proliferation controls that allows cells to proliferate over confluence. Moreover, the silencing of Cdh4 by artificial microRNAs induced a decrease in the infiltrative ability of human glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. More strikingly, Cdh4 silencing induced an impairment of the tumorigenic potential of these cells after orthotopic transplantation in immunodeficient mice.

We have previously shown that ODZ1 contributes to glioblastoma invasion and that ODZ1 mRNA levels can be upregulated by epigenetic mechanisms in response to hypoxia. Herein, we have further studied the transcriptional regulation of ODZ1 in GBM stem cells (GSCs) under hypoxic conditions and analyzed whether HIF2Î± has any role in this regulation. Methods: We performed the experiments in three primary GSC cell lines established from tumor specimens. GSCs were cultured under hypoxia, treated with HIF regulators (DMOG, chetomin), or transfected with specific siRNAs, and the expression levels of ODZ1 and HIF2Î± were analyzed. In addition, the response of the ODZ1 promoter cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid to the activation of HIF was also studied. Results: The upregulation of both mRNA and protein levels of HIF2Î± under hypoxia conditions correlated with the expression of ODZ1 mRNA. Moreover, the knockdown of HIF2Î± by siRNAs downregulated the expression of ODZ1. We found, in the ODZ1 promoter, a HIF consensus binding site (GCGTG) 1358 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) and a HIF-like site (CCGTG) 826 bp from the TSS. Luciferase assays revealed that the stabilization of HIF by DMOG resulted in the increased activity of the ODZ1 promoter.

We previously detected focal genomic amplification of PDE1C in >90 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells suggesting a potential as a novel therapeutic target in these cells. In this report, we show that genomic gain of PDE1C was associated with increased expression in low passage GBM-derived cell cultures. We demonstrate that PDE1C is essential in driving cell proliferation, migration and invasion in GBM cultures since silencing of this gene significantly mitigates these functions. We also define the mechanistic basis of this functional effect through whole genome expression analysis by identifying down-stream gene effectors of PDE1C which are involved in cell cycle and cell adhesion regulation. In addition, we also demonstrate that Vinpocetine, a general PDE1 inhibitor, can also attenuate proliferation with no effect on invasion/migration. Up-regulation of at least one of this gene set (IL8, CXCL2, FOSB, NFE2L3, SUB1, SORBS2, WNT5A, and MMP1) in TCGA GBM cohorts is associated with worse outcome and PDE1C silencing down-regulated their expression, thus also indicating potential to influence patient survival.

This conflicting data bring into question whether BMP signaling is growth suppressive or growth promoting in GBMs. We utilized BMP inhibitors DMH1, JL5, and Ym155 to examine the role of BMP signaling on the growth of GBMs. DMH1 targets BMP type 1 receptors whereas JL5 inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Ym155 does not bind the BMP receptors but rather inhibits BMP signaling by inducing the degradation of BMPR2. We show that JL5, DMH1, and Ym155 decreased the expression of ID1 in SD2 and U87 cells. JL5 and Ym155 also decreased the expression of BMPR2 and its downstream target inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. JL5 treatment resulted in significant cell death and suppressed self-renewal to a greater extent than that induced by BMP4 ligand. The lysosome inhibitor chloroquine increases the localization of BMPR2 to the plasma membrane enhancing JL5-induced downregulation of ID1 and cell death in SD2 cells. We show that BMP signaling is growth promoting in GBMs. These studies suggest the need for development of BMP inhibitors and evaluation as potential therapeutic for GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35192123
"""Survivin knockdown and concurrent 4-HPR treatment controlled human glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo.""","""Survivin is highly expressed in most cancers, including glioblastoma, and it plays a significant role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting tumor growth. Treatment of cancer cells with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) induces apoptosis through destabilization of mitochondrial membrane and activation of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways. We studied the efficacy of a combination of survivin knockdown and 4-HPR treatment to induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion, angiogenesis, and growth of human glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo. Using a plasmid encoding survivin shRNA, we downregulated survivin in glioblastoma U251MG and U118MG cells and simultaneously treated with 1 ÂµM 4-HPR for 48 hours. Cells following treatments were subjected to the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and invasion assays. In vivo angiogenesis and tumor regression studies were performed in nude mice. TUNEL assay demonstrated apoptosis in more than 80% of cells after survivin knockdown and 4-HPR treatment. Matrigel invasion assays demonstrated marked decreases in tumor cell invasion. In vivo angiogenesis studies depicted a remarkable inhibition of neovascularization due to the knockdown of survivin and 4-HPR treatment. Imaging of intracerebral tumorigenesis and longitudinal studies on subcutaneous solid tumor formation showed dramatic decreases in tumorigenesis and solid tumor progression, respectively, after treatment with the combination. Studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor regression demonstrated marked decreases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen, metalloproteinase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and CD31 in solid tumors. Our data demonstrated that survivin knockdown and concurrent 4-HPR treatment could be a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling growth of human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679253
"""Single cell sequencing revealed the mechanism of CRYAB in glioma and its diagnostic and prognostic value.""","""Background: We explored the characteristics of single-cell differentiation data in glioblastoma and established prognostic markers based on CRYAB to predict the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Aberrant expression of CRYAB is associated with invasive behavior in various tumors, including glioblastoma. However, the specific role and mechanisms of CRYAB in glioblastoma are still unclear. Methods: We assessed RNA-seq and microarray data from TCGA and GEO databases, combined with scRNA-seq data on glioma patients from GEO. Utilizing the Seurat R package, we identified distinct survival-related gene clusters in the scRNA-seq data. Prognostic pivotal genes were discovered through single-factor Cox analysis, and a prognostic model was established using LASSO and stepwise regression algorithms. Moreover, we investigated the predictive potential of these genes in the immune microenvironment and their applicability in immunotherapy. Finally, in vitro experiments confirmed the functional significance of the high-risk gene CRYAB. Results: By analyzing the ScRNA-seq data, we identified 28 cell clusters representing seven cell types. After dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, we obtained four subpopulations within the oligodendrocyte lineage based on their differentiation trajectory. Using CRYAB as a marker gene for the terminal-stage subpopulation, we found that its expression was associated with poor prognosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that knocking out CRYAB in U87 and LN229 cells reduced cell viability, proliferation, and invasiveness. Conclusion: The risk model based on CRYAB holds promise in accurately predicting glioblastoma. A comprehensive study of the specific mechanisms of CRYAB in glioblastoma would contribute to understanding its response to immunotherapy. Targeting the CRYAB gene may be beneficial for glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38274814
"""Assessment and prediction of glioblastoma therapy response: challenges and opportunities.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of primary adult brain tumour. The median survival of patients with glioblastoma remains approximately 15 months, and the 5-year survival rate is <10%. Current treatment options are limited, and the standard of care has remained relatively constant since 2011. Over the last decade, a range of different treatment regimens have been investigated with very limited success. Tumour recurrence is almost inevitable with the current treatment strategies, as glioblastoma tumours are highly heterogeneous and invasive. Additionally, another challenging issue facing patients with glioblastoma is how to distinguish between tumour progression and treatment effects, especially when relying on routine diagnostic imaging techniques in the clinic. The specificity of routine imaging for identifying tumour progression early or in a timely manner is poor due to the appearance similarity of post-treatment effects. Here, we concisely describe the current status and challenges in the assessment and early prediction of therapy response and the early detection of tumour progression or recurrence. We also summarize and discuss studies of advanced approaches such as quantitative imaging, liquid biomarker discovery and machine intelligence that hold exceptional potential to aid in the therapy monitoring of this malignancy and early prediction of therapy response, which may decisively transform the conventional detection methods in the era of precision medicine.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36445396

"""Bevacizumab for Patients with Recurrent Multifocal Glioblastomas.""","""In patients with glioblastoma, antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab (BEV) has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS), but not overall survival (OS). Especially in patients with an unusual infiltrative phenotype as seen in multifocal glioblastoma, the use of BEV therapy is still more controversial. Therefore, we prepared a retrospective case series with 16 patients suffering from a multifocal glioblastoma treated with BEV. We compared these patients to a matched control cohort of 16 patients suffering from glioblastoma with a single lesion treated with BEV. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the course of disease differs in glioblastoma patients with a multifocal disease pattern compared to those with a single lesion only. Patients were treated with BEV monotherapy or BEV in combination with irinotecan or lomustine (CCNU). Response rates and PFS were similar in both groups. There was a trend for an unfavorable OS in the patient group with multifocal glioblastoma, which was expected due to the generally worse prognosis of multifocal glioblastoma. We investigated whether BEV therapy affects the invasive growth pattern as measured by the appearance of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Under BEV therapy, there was a trend for a lower frequency of new lesions both in multifocal and solitary glioblastoma. Based on these results, BEV therapy at relapse appears to be justified to no lesser extent in multifocal glioblastoma than in solitary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29156610

Methods: The miR- 27a expression level in specimens of human glioblastoma and normal human brain tissues excised during decompression for traumatic brain injury was assessed using qRT-PCR; The predicted target gene of miR-27a was screened out through bioinformatics databases, and the predicted gene was verified using genetic report assays; the effect of antagomiR-27a on the invasion and proliferation of glioma cells was analyzed using MTT assays and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling. A xenograft glioblastoma model in BALB-c nude mice was established to detect the effect of antagomiR-27a on tumour growth. Results: qRT-PCR results showed that miR-27a significantly increased in specimens from glioblastoma comparing with normal human brain tissues. Th miR-27a inhibitor significantly suppressed invasion and proliferation of glioblastoma cells. FOXO3a was verified as a new target of miR-27a by Western blotting and reporter analyzes.

"""Identification of 2-Fluoropalmitic Acid as a Potential Therapeutic Agent Against Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive malignant brain tumors. Although chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) can extend patient survival, most patients eventually demonstrate resistance. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents that overcome TMZ chemoresistance are required to improve patient outcomes. Purpose: Drug screening is an efficient method to find new therapeutic agents from existing drugs. In this study, we explored a novel anti-glioma agent by drug screening and analyzed its function with respect to GBM treatment for future clinical applications. Methods: Drug libraries containing 1,301 diverse chemical compounds were screened against two glioma stem cell (GSC) lines for drug candidate selection. The effect of selected agents on GSCs and glioma was estimated through viability, proliferation, sphere formation, and invasion assays. Combination therapy was performed to assess its ability to enhance TMZ cytotoxicity against GBM. To clarify the mechanism of action, we performed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, gelatin zymography, and western blot analysis. Results: The acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor 2-fluoropalmitic acid (2-FPA) was selected as a candidate anti-glioma agent. 2-FPA suppressed the viability and stem-like phenotype of GSCs. It also inhibited proliferation and invasion of glioma cell lines. Combination therapy of 2-FPA with TMZ synergistically enhanced the efficacy of TMZ. 2-FPA suppressed the expression of phosphor-ERK, CD133, and SOX-2; reduced MMP-2 activity; and increased methylation of the MGMT promoter.

"""Transforming growth factor Î² and bone morphogenetic protein actions in brain tumors.""","""Members of the transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) family are implicated in the biology of several cancers. Here we focus on malignancies of the brain and examine the TGFÎ² and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling branches of the family. These pathways exhibit context-dependent actions during tumorigenesis, acting either as tumor suppressors or as pro-tumorigenic agents. In the brain, the TGF-Î²s associate with oncogenic development and progression to the more malignant state. Inversely, the BMPs suppress tumorigenic potential by acting as agents that induce tumor cell differentiation. The latter has been best demonstrated in grade IV astrocytomas, otherwise known as glioblastoma multiforme. We discuss how the actions of TGF-Î²s and BMPs on cancer stem cells may explain their effects on tumor progression, and try to highlight intricate mechanisms that may link tumor cell differentiation to invasion. The focus on TGF-Î² and BMP and their actions in brain malignancies provides a rich territory for mechanistic understanding of tumor heterogeneity and suggests ways for improved therapeutic intervention, currently being addressed by clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25957771
"""RUNX1 Regulates Migration, Invasion, and Angiogenesis via p38 MAPK Pathway in Human Glioblastoma.""","""Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is essential for the establishment of fetal and adult hematopoiesis and neuronal development. Aberrant expression of RUNX1 led to proliferation and metastasis of several cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of RUNX1 in migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma using IL-1Î²-treated U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells as a model. IL-1Î² at 10 ng/ml stimulated translocation of RUNX1 into the nucleus with increased expressions of RUNX1, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-19, and VEGFA in U-87 MG cells. In addition, silencing of RUNX1 gene significantly suppressed U-87 MG cell migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, knockdown of RUNX1 mRNA in U-87 MG cells reduced the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Further investigation revealed that IL-1Î²-induced RUNX1 expression might be mediated via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling molecule for the expression of these invasion- and angiogenic-related molecules. Together with an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) could decrease RUNX1 mRNA expression. Thus, RUNX1 may be one of the putative molecular targeted therapies against glioma metastasis and angiogenesis through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28012022
"""Role of CD44 in the invasiveness of glioblastoma multiforme and the noninvasiveness of meningioma: an immunohistochemistry study.""","""CD44 is a polymorphic family of cell adhesion molecules that seems to be instrumental in the mechanism of tumor invasion and metastasis. Tumor cell expression of CD44, or lack thereof, may be one of the factors conditioning the highly disparate ability to penetrate the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibited by glioblastoma multiforme (GM) and conventional meningioma. To assess the presence of CD44 in these two tumor types we have immunohistochemically investigated the expression of CD44 standard form (CD44s) and the variant isoforms containing the domain encoded by variant exon 3 (CD44v3) and variant exon 6 (CD44v6) in paraffin-embedded tissue from 10 conventional meningiomas and 10 GMs. A CD44s-/CD44v-phenotype was discerned in the meningioma cases, whereas GMs featured a CD44s+/CD44v- expression profile. Consequently, the growth patterns of meningioma and GM seem to be, at least in part, a reflection of their CD44 expression status. Paucity of CD44 in meningioma cells would render them unable to infiltrate the brain ECM, whereas CD44-rich glioma cells would successfully migrate through it. Conversely, lack of CD44v expression would contribute to explain the lack of metastatic potential characterizing both conventional meningioma and GM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7557949
"""Genome-wide transcriptional analyses of Chinese patients reveal cell migration is attenuated in IDH1-mutant glioblastomas.""","""Patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutant glioblastoma exhibit increased survival compared with those with wild-type IDH1 tumors. The magnitude of this finding has led to the use of IDH1 mutations as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, the mechanisms underlying the reported correlation between the IDH1 mutation and increased survival have not been fully revealed. In this work, based on genome-wide transcriptional analyses of 69 Chinese patients with glioblastoma, we have found that the focal adhesion pathway is significantly downregulated in IDH1-mutant glioblastomas. The impaired focal adhesion leads to compromised cell migration and tumor invasion, contributing to the optimistic prognosis of these patients. Moreover, the signature genes of HIF-1Î±, the downstream factor of mutated IDH1, are found to be suppressed in IDH1-mutant gliomas. Given the role of HIF-1Î± in cell migration, we conclude that the attenuation of HIF-1Î±-dependent glioblastoma cell infiltration contributes to the better outcomes of patients with IDH1-mutant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25511738
"""Modeling Patient-Derived Glioblastoma with Cerebral Organoids.""","""The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal, with a median survival of approximately 15 months.

Our cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model shows that GSCs home toward the human cerebral organoid and deeply invade and proliferate within the host tissue, forming tumors that closely phenocopy patient GBMs. Furthermore, cerebral organoid tumors form rapidly and are supported by an interconnected network of tumor microtubes that aids in the invasion of normal host tissue.

"""Death-associated protein 3 (Dap-3) is overexpressed in invasive glioblastoma cells in vivo and in glioma cell lines with induced motility phenotype in vitro.""","""Purpose: To discover the genetic determinants of glioma invasion in vivo, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of glioblastoma cells residing at the tumor core versus those at the invasive rim of a human tumor resection. Experimental design: From a single glioblastoma specimen, 20,000 individual cells from each region (core and invasive rim) were collected by laser capture microdissection and analyzed by mRNA differential display. Differential expression of gene candidates was confirmed by laser capture microdissection and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in additional glioblastoma multiforme specimens, and the role in migration was further evaluated in glioma cell lines in vitro. Results: Reproducible overexpression the death-associated Protein 3 (Dap-3) mRNA (NM 004632, GenBank; also reported as human ionizing resistance conferring protein mRNA, HSU18321, GenBank) by invasive cells was identified. Although the full-length Dap-3 protein has been described as proapoptotic, the NH(2)-terminal fragment can act in a dominant negative way resulting in protection from programmed cell death. In glioma cell lines T98G and G112 with an induced motility phenotype, Dap-3 was up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA microarray, and Western blot analysis. These cells showed an increased resistance to undergo camptothecin-induced apoptosis, which was overcome by effective Dap-3-antisense treatment. Antisense treatment also decreased the migration ability of T98G cells. Conclusions: Dap-3 is up-regulated in invasive glioblastoma multiforme cells in vivo and in glioma cells with an induced motility phenotype in vitro. When migration is activated, Dap-3 is up-regulated and cells become resistant to apoptosis. These findings suggest that Dap-3 confers apoptosis-resistance when migration behavior is engaged.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11489830

In the present work, we analyzed glucose metabolism to investigate whether lactate could be predictive of tumor invasiveness and of use in detection of the tumor invasion area in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Methods: The expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was investigated in 20 patients. In GSC lines, LDH-A and PDH expression also was examined in parallel to assessments of mitochondrial respiration. We then investigated the relationship between lactate/creatine ratios in the tumor periphery measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, using learning-compression-model algorithms and phenotypes of GBMs. Results: In 20 GBMs, high-invasive GBM expressed LDH-A at significantly higher expression than did low-invasive GBM, whereas low-invasive GBM showed significantly higher expression of PDH than did high-invasive GBM. The highly invasive GSC line showed higher expression of LDH-A and lower expression of PDH compared with low-invasive GSC lines. The highly invasive GSC line also showed the lowest consumption of oxygen and the lowest production of adenosine triphosphate. Lactate levels, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, showed a significant positive correlation with LDH-A transcript levels, permitting classification of the GBMs into high-invasive and low-invasive phenotypes based on a cutoff value of 0.66 in the lactate/creatine ratio. Conclusions: In the tumor periphery area of the highly invasive GBM, aerobic glycolysis was the predominant pathway for glucose metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of lactate.

Chemoradiotherapy resistance and recurrence after surgery are the main malignant progression factors, leading to a high mortality rate. Therefore, the exploration of novel biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of GBM is urgent. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of GBM were screened in a TCGA dataset. Homo sapiens ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein (ZWINT) was found to be upregulated in GBM, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. A proteinâprotein interaction (PPI) network was established by the STRING database, and hub genes were visualized by Cytoscape. The correlation results were verified with the GSE15824 dataset.

"""SLC7A11 Overexpression in Glioblastoma Is Associated with Increased Cancer Stem Cell-Like Properties.""","""System xc- is a sodium-independent electroneutral transporter, comprising a catalytic subunit xCT (SLC7A11), which is involved in importing cystine. Certain cancers such as gliomas upregulate the expression of system xc-, which confers a survival advantage against the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing generation of the antioxidant glutathione. However, ROS have also been shown to function as targeted, intracellular second messengers in an array of physiological processes such as proliferation. Several studies have implicated ROS in important cancer features such as migration, invasion, and contribution to a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotype. The role of system xc- in regulating these ROS-sensitive processes in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults, remains unknown. Stable SLC7A11 knockdown and overexpressing U251 glioma cells were generated and characterized to understand the role of redox and system xc- in glioma progression. SLC7A11 knockdown resulted in higher endogenous ROS levels and enhanced invasive properties. On the contrary, overexpression of SLC7A11 resulted in decreased endogenous ROS levels as well as decreased migration and invasion. However, SLC7A11-overexpressing cells displayed actin cytoskeleton changes reminiscent of epithelial-like cells and exhibited an increased CSC-like phenotype. The enhanced CSC-like phenotype may contribute to increased chemoresistance and suggests that overexpression of SLC7A11 in the context of GBM may contribute to tumor progression.

However, the variability in biological behaviors amongst cells within individual tumors is not well described. Invasion into unaffected brain parenchyma is one such behavior, and a leading mechanism of tumor recurrence unaddressed by the current therapeutic armamentarium. Further, providing insight into variability of tumor cell migration within individual tumors may inform discovery of novel anti-invasive therapeutics. In this study, ex vivo organotypic slice cultures from EGFR-wild type and EGFR-amplified patient tumors were treated with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib to evaluate potential sub-population restricted intratumoral drug-specific responses. High-resolution time-lapse microscopy and quantitative path tracking demonstrated migration of individual cells are punctuated by intermittent bursts of movement. Elevation of population aggregate mean speeds were driven by subpopulations of cells exhibiting frequent high-amplitude bursts, enriched within EGFR-amplified tumors. Treatment with gefitinib specifically targeted high-burst cell subpopulations only in EGFR-amplified tumors, decreasing bursting frequency and amplitude. We provide evidence of intratumoral subpopulations of cells with enhanced migratory behavior in human glioblastoma, selectively targeted via EGFR inhibition.

"""Inhibition of nestin suppresses stem cell phenotype of glioblastomas through the alteration of post-translational modification of heat shock protein HSPA8/HSC71.""","""Nestin, a class VI intermediate filament, was first described as a neuronal stem/progenitor cell marker. We previously reported that knockdown of nestin expression in human glioblastoma cells suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the present study, we examined the effect of nestin on stemness, and identified molecules involved in modulating nestin function in glioblastoma cells. Nestin expression was shown to be higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. Furthermore, compared with control cells, nestin short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transfected glioblastoma cells exhibited reduced sphere formation, decreased expression of NANOG, N-cadherin, CD133, and Oct-4, and decreased tumor size in vivo. To examine the proteins regulated by nestin in glioblastomas, we carried out two-dimensional electrophoresis using nestin shRNA-transfected glioblastoma cells. As a result, nestin shRNA-transfected glioblastoma cells exhibited a decrease in the level of phosphorylation of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC71; gene HSPA8). From immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated the direct binding of nestin, HSC71, and cyclin D1 in vitro. Overexpression of nestin in glioblastoma cells increased cell growth, sphere formation, and cell invasion. Transfection with HSC71 siRNA restored nestin expression and cell behavior; therefore, HSC71 knockdown will interfere with enhanced tumorigenic properties of glioblastoma cells that ectopically overexpress nestin. We have demonstrated that HSC71 and nestin regulate each other's expression levels or patterns, and that cyclin D1 is located downstream of nestin and HSC71. In conclusion, nestin regulates stemness, cell growth, and invasion in glioblastoma cells through the alteration of HSC71. Inhibition of nestin and HSC71 may thus be a useful molecular target in the treatment of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527454

According to a Matrigel invasion assay, the tropism of the hMSCs for U87 cells was not affected. In glioma cell lines U251 and LN229, hMSCs exhibited tropism in vivo, and invasion of hMSCs cotransfected with hsa-miR-145-5p and -31-5p was also significantly less than that of control cells. When U87 cells were coimplanted into the striatum of organotypic rat brain slices with hMSCs cotransfected with hsa-miR-145 and -31-5p, the relative invasive area decreased by 37.1%; interestingly, these U87 cells showed a change to a rounded morphology that was apparent at the invasion front. Whole-genome microarray analysis of the expression levels of 58,341 genes revealed that the co-overexpression of hsa-miR-145-5p and -31-5p downregulated FSCN1 expression in U87 cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that miRNA overexpression in hMSCs can alter the function of glioma cells via contact-dependent transfer. Co-overexpression of multiple miRNAs may be a useful and novel therapeutic strategy. The study results suggest that hMSCs can be applied as a delivery vehicle for miRNAs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29521593
"""Novel Peripherally Derived Neural-Like Stem Cells as Therapeutic Carriers for Treating Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common primary malignant adult brain tumor characterized by extensive invasiveness, heterogeneity, and angiogenesis. Standard treatment options such as radiation and chemotherapy have proven to be only marginally effective in treating GBM because of its invasive nature. Therefore, extensive efforts have been put forth to develop tumor-tropic stem cells as viable therapeutic vehicles with potential to treat even the most invasive tumor cells that are harbored within areas of normal brain. To this end, we discovered a newly described NG2-expressing cell that we isolated from a distinct pericyte subtype found abundantly in cultures derived from peripheral muscle. In this work, we show the translational significance of these peripherally derived neural-like stem cells (NLSC) and their potential to migrate toward tumors and act as therapeutic carriers. We demonstrate that these NLSCs exhibit in vitro and in vivo GBM tropism. Furthermore, NLSCs did not promote angiogenesis or transform into tumor-associated stromal cells, which are concerns raised when using other common stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and induced neural stem cells, as therapeutic carriers. We also demonstrate the potential of NLSCs to express a prototype therapeutic, tumor necrosis factor Î±-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and kill GBM cells in vitro. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our newly characterized NLSC against GBM. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:471-481.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28191774

These miRNAs are downregulated in glioblastomas and might have a tumor suppressive role. Any association between the expression levels of cluster-14-miRNAs with overall survival (OS) is undetermined. We randomly selected miR-433, belonging to sub-cluster 14A and miR-323a-3p and miR-369-3p, belonging to sub-cluster 14B, and assessed their role in glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo. We also determined the expression level of cluster-14-miRNAs in 27 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and analyzed the association between their level of expression and OS. Overexpression of miR-323a-3p and miR-369-3p, but not miR-433, in glioblastoma cells inhibited their proliferation and migration in vitro. Mice implanted with glioblastoma cells overexpressing miR323a-3p and miR369-3p, but not miR433, exhibited prolonged survival compared to controls (P = .003). Bioinformatics analysis identified 13 putative target genes of cluster-14-miRNAs, and real-time RT-PCR validated these findings. Pathway analysis of the putative target genes identified neuregulin as the most enriched pathway. The expression level of cluster-14-miRNAs correlated with patients' OS. The median OS was 8.5 months for patients with low expression levels and 52.7 months for patients with high expression levels (HR 0.34; 95 % CI 0.12-0.59, P = .003). The expression level of cluster-14-miRNAs correlates directly with OS, suggesting a role for this cluster in promoting aggressive behavior of glioblastoma, possibly through ErBb/neuregulin signaling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27573219
"""Propentofylline inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion and survival by targeting the TROY signaling pathway.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the CNS and carries a dismal prognosis. The aggressive invasion of GBM cells into the surrounding normal brain makes complete resection impossible, significantly increases resistance to the standard therapy regimen, and virtually assures tumor recurrence. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM is 14.6 months and declines to 8 months for patients with recurrent GBM. New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome. We have demonstrated that TROY (TNFRSF19), a member of the TNFR super-family, plays an important role in GBM invasion and resistance. Knockdown of TROY expression inhibits GBM cell invasion, increases sensitivity to temozolomide, and prolongs survival in an intracranial xenograft model. Propentofylline (PPF), an atypical synthetic methylxanthine compound, has been extensively studied in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia where it has demonstrated blood-brain permeability and minimal adverse side effects. Here we showed that PPF decreased GBM cell expression of TROY, inhibited glioma cell invasion, and sensitized GBM cells to TMZ. Mechanistically, PPF decreased glioma cell invasion by modulating TROY expression and downstream signaling, including AKT, NF-ÎºB, and Rac1 activation. Thus, PPF may provide a pharmacologic approach to target TROY, inhibit cell invasion, and reduce therapeutic resistance in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26559543

We detected LIN28A protein in a subset of human gliomas observed higher expression in glioblastoma (GBM) than in lower grade tumors. Knockdown of LIN28A using lentiviral shRNA in GBM cell lines inhibited their invasion, growth and clonogenicity. Expression of LIN28A in GBM cell lines increased the number and size of orthotopic xenograft tumors. LIN28A expression also enhanced the invasiveness of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. Increasing LIN28A was associated with down-regulation of tumor suppressing microRNAs let-7b and let-7g and up-regulation of the chromatin modifying protein HMGA2. The increase in tumor cell aggressiveness in vivo and in vitro was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-invasive gene expression, including SNAI1. To further investigate the oncogenic potential of LIN28A, we infected hNSC with lentiviruses encoding LIN28A together with dominant negative R248W-TP53, constitutively active KRAS and hTERT. Resulting subclones proliferated at an increased rate and formed invasive GBM-like tumors in orthotopic xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Similar to LIN28A-transduced GBM neurosphere lines, hNSC-derived tumor cells showed increased expression of HMGA2.

"""Regulatory factor X1 is a new tumor suppressive transcription factor that acts via direct downregulation of CD44 in glioblastoma.""","""Background: The biological functions of regulatory factor (RF)X1, a transcription factor, are not known. Since the RFX1 gene is often epigenetically silenced and clusters of differentiation (CD)44 proteins that regulate cancer cell biology are increased in human glioblastomas, we designed this study to determine whether RFX1 could regulate CD44 expression in glioblastoma. Methods: Regulatory factor X1 was overexpressed in 4 human glioblastoma cell lines. CD44 expression and cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were assayed under in vitro conditions. In vivo growth of human glioblastoma xenografts was determined in mice. The expression of RFX1 and CD44 in human glioblastoma tissues was quantified. Results: A putative RFX1 binding sequence existed in the first exon of the human CD44 gene. The transcription activity of the DNA fragment containing this putative sequence was decreased in cells overexpressing RFX1. Regulatory factor X1 bound to the CD44 gene in glioblastoma cells. It reduced CD44 expression and activated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, signaling molecules downstream of CD44 to regulate cell proliferation and survival. Overexpression of RFX1 inhibited the survival, proliferation, and transwell invasion of glioblastoma cells and in vivo growth of human glioblastoma xenografts. CD44 overexpression reversed RFX1 effects on cell proliferation. Finally, CD44 protein levels were inversely correlated with RFX1 protein levels in human glioblastoma tissues. Conclusions: These results suggest that RFX1 directly regulates CD44 expression. This mechanism may contribute to RFX1's effects on proliferation, survival, and invasion of glioblastoma cells.

"""Predicting the efficacy of radiotherapy in individual glioblastoma patients in vivo: a mathematical modeling approach.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of primary brain tumors known as gliomas. They proliferate and invade extensively and yield short life expectancies despite aggressive treatment. Response to treatment is usually measured in terms of the survival of groups of patients treated similarly, but this statistical approach misses the subgroups that may have responded to or may have been injured by treatment. Such statistics offer scant reassurance to individual patients who have suffered through these treatments. Furthermore, current imaging-based treatment response metrics in individual patients ignore patient-specific differences in tumor growth kinetics, which have been shown to vary widely across patients even within the same histological diagnosis and, unfortunately, these metrics have shown only minimal success in predicting patient outcome. We consider nine newly diagnosed GBM patients receiving diagnostic biopsy followed by standard-of-care external beam radiation therapy (XRT). We present and apply a patient-specific, biologically based mathematical model for glioma growth that quantifies response to XRT in individual patients in vivo. The mathematical model uses net rates of proliferation and migration of malignant tumor cells to characterize the tumor's growth and invasion along with the linear-quadratic model for the response to radiation therapy. Using only routinely available pre-treatment MRIs to inform the patient-specific bio-mathematical model simulations, we find that radiation response in these patients, quantified by both clinical and model-generated measures, could have been predicted prior to treatment with high accuracy. Specifically, we find that the net proliferation rate is correlated with the radiation response parameter (r = 0.89, p = 0.0007), resulting in a predictive relationship that is tested with a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. This relationship predicts the tumor size post-therapy to within inter-observer tumor volume uncertainty. The results of this study suggest that a mathematical model can create a virtual in silico tumor with the same growth kinetics as a particular patient and can not only predict treatment response in individual patients in vivo but also provide a basis for evaluation of response in each patient to any given therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20484781
"""Synergistic down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in SNB19 glioblastoma cells efficiently inhibits glioma cell invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.""","""The binding of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to its receptor (uPAR) initiates a proteolytic cascade facilitating the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which in turn degrades the extracellular matrix. These processes have an established role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Our previous work revealed an inverse association between glioma invasion and the expression of uPAR and MMP-9. In the present study, we used the adenovirus serotype 5 vector system to generate a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus capable of simultaneously expressing antisense uPAR and antisense MMP-9 (Ad-uPAR-MMP-9). This adenoviral construct is driven by the independent promoter elements cytomegalovirus and bovine growth hormone and SV40 polyadenylation signals to down-regulate key steps in the proteolytic cascade. Ad-uPAR-MMP-9 infection of SNB19 cells significantly decreased uPAR and MMP-9 expression as determined by immunohistochemical and Western blotting analyses. A Matrigel invasion assay revealed marked reduction in the invasiveness of the Ad-uPAR-MMP-9-infected cells compared with parental and vector controls. Tumor spheroids infected with Ad-uPAR-MMP-9 and cocultured with fetal rat brain aggregates did not invade rat brain aggregates, whereas 90-95% of the mock and empty vector-infected cells invaded the rat brain aggregates. Intracranial injection of SNB19 cells infected ex vivo with the Ad-uPAR-MMP-9 antisense bicistronic construct showed decreased invasiveness and tumorigenicity. s.c. injections of the bicistronic antisense construct into established tumors (U87 MG) caused tumor regression.

To determine whether matrix metalloproteinases, key factors in cell invasion, are affected by exposure to estramustine, a cell proliferation assay, a zymogram, a collagenolysis assay and a haptoinvasion assay were used in this study. The zymogram revealed that an activated (62 kDa) form of matrix metalloproteinase-2 diminished with increasing estramustine concentrations. The collagenolysis assay demonstrated approximately 2.5- to 21-fold lower rates of enzymatic activity suppressed by estramustine in a dose-dependent manner at estramustine concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 microM, compared with the control group. On the haptoinvasion assay, no statistically significant difference was seen in the 0.5 microM estramustine group, whereas 1-10 microM estramustine groups revealed significant suppression of invasion from 6 to 24 h in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that estramustine suppresses the invasion of U87MG cells in vitro using the decreasing available matrix metalloproteinase-2, an effect caused by the disassembly of microtubules.

"""Non-invasive imaging of glioma vessel size and densities in correlation with tumour cell proliferation by small animal PET and MRI.""","""Purpose: Angiogenesis is a key event in the progression of glioblastomas (GBM).

We focused on how these anatomical and biochemical read-outs correlate with one another and with immunohistochemistry. Methods: SSCE-MRI together with (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT PET were performed 3 weeks after intracranial implantation of human GBM spheroids in nude rats (n = 8). Total cerebral blood volume (tCBV), blood volume present in microvessels (Î¼CBV), vessel density and size were calculated. Rats were treated with bevacizumab (n = 4) or vehicle (n = 4) for 3 weeks. Imaging was repeated at week 6, and thereafter immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: Three weeks after implantation, MRI showed an increase of vessel density and Î¼CBV in the tumour compared to the contralateral brain. At week 6, non-treated rats showed a pronounced increase of (11)C-MET and (18)F-FLT tumour uptake. Between weeks 3 and 6, tCBV and vessel size increased, whereas vessel density and Î¼CBV decreased. In rats treated with bevacizumab Î¼CBV values were significantly smaller at week 6 than in non-treated rats, whereas the mean vessel size was higher. Accumulation of both radiotracers was lower for the treated versus the non-treated group. Most importantly, non-invasive measurement of tumour vessel characteristics and tumour proliferation correlated to immunohistochemistry findings. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that SSCE-MRI enables non-invasive assessment of the anatomy and physiology of the vasculature of experimental gliomas. Combined SSCE-MRI and (11)C-MET/(18)F-FLT PET for monitoring biochemical markers of angiogenesis and proliferation in addition to vessel anatomy could be useful to improve our understanding of therapy response of gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23754761

Even with aggressive treatment, the prognosis is extremely poor. The large GTPase Guanylate-Binding Protein-1 (GBP-1) contributes to the poor prognosis of GBM by promoting migration and invasion. GBP-1 is substantially localized to the cytosolic side of the outer membrane of mitochondria in GBM cells. Because mitochondrial dynamics, particularly mitochondrial fission, can drive cell migration and invasion, the potential interactions between GBP-1 and mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) were explored. Drp1 is the major driver of mitochondrial fission. While GBP-1 and Drp1 both had punctate distributions within the cytoplasm and localized to regions of the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane of GBM cells, the proteins were only molecularly co-localized at the mitochondria. Subcellular fractionation showed that the presence of elevated GBP-1 promoted the movement of Drp1 from the cytosol to the mitochondria. The migration of U251 cells treated with the Drp1 inhibitor, Mdivi-1, was less inhibited in the cells with elevated GBP-1. Elevated GBP-1 in GBM cells resulted in shorter and wider mitochondria, most likely from mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial fission can drive several important cellular processes, including cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39457021

Some of these vitamin A derivatives are already in clinical use. However, data on retinoid actions in glial tumors are rather sparse. Therefore, we studied the effects of the natural retinoic acid (RA) forms all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA on glioma cell lines and primary cultures from patients with glioblastomas multiforme. Methods: Six human glioma cell lines, one rat glioma cell line, and 20 primary cultures established from biopsies from patients with glioblastomas multiforme were investigated. Tumor cell proliferation was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cell-counting assays. Random migration out of tumor spheroids was quantified using a video-morphometry system. Invasion was investigated using a confrontational coculture test system. Retinoid receptor (RA receptor [RAR]alpha, -beta, and -gamma and retinoid X receptor [RXR]alpha, -beta, and -gamma) expression status was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies. Results: Treatment of five human glioma cell lines with the different retinoids at concentrations up to 10(-5) mol/L produced no reduction of proliferation, using various incubation times. For one human glioma cell line (U343MG-A) and one rat glioma cell line (C6), which were previously reported to be sensitive to retinoids, we could confirm strong inhibitory effects on proliferation and clear changes in morphological features after retinoid treatment. Application of the different retinoids to low-passage primary cultures of human glioblastomas resulted in marked inhibition of proliferation (30-95%) for all tested samples. Using three-dimensional spheroid cultures, we detected retinoid-induced decreases in cell migration (24-65%). Invasion was not affected by these vitamin A derivatives. In an analysis of the expression patterns for retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs), all primary culture samples yielded positive results for RAR gamma and RXR alpha and negative results for RAR alpha, RAR beta, and RXR gamma, whereas the results of RXR beta expression were heterogeneous among different patients. The cell lines, irrespective of their RA sensitivities, did not exhibit any major differences in receptor expression. Conclusion: Retinoids strongly inhibit proliferation and migration in primary cultures of human glioblastomas multiforme. Our data support a clinical trial of retinoids for the treatment of human malignant gliomas. We observed that most established cell lines were not sensitive to RA. This difference between long-term cell lines and primary cultures cannot be explained by different retinoid receptor expression patterns.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10690732

A bioinformatics approach was used to identify the medications that increased RFX1. The effects of these medications on human glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assayed under cell culture and mouse brain xenograft conditions. Pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and WY-14643 increased RFX1 based on bioinformatics prediction and Western blotting data.

There are limited expression data from GBMs at recurrence and surprisingly little is known about the evolution of splicing patterns under therapy. Result: We profile 37 primary-recurrent paired human GBM specimens via RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of alternative splicing in GBM at recurrence and contrast that to primary and non-malignant brain-tissue specimens. By screening single-cell atlases, we identify cell-type-specific splicing patterns and novel splicing events in cell-surface proteins that are suitable targets for engineered T cell therapies.

To improve clinical outcomes, it is critical to develop in vitro models that support GBM proliferation and invasion for deciphering tumor progression and screening drug candidates.

We recently reported the development of a MMP-degradable, poly(ethylene-glycol)-based hydrogel platform for culturing GBM cells. In the present study, we modulated the percentage of MMP-degradable crosslinks in 3D hydrogels to analyze the effects of MMP-degradability on GBM fates. Using an immortalized GBM cell line (U87) as a model cell type, our results showed that MMP-degradability was not required for supporting GBM proliferation. All hydrogel formulations supported robust GBM proliferation, up to 10 fold after 14 days. However, MMP-degradability was essential for facilitating tumor spreading, and 50% MMP-degradable hydrogels were sufficient to enable both robust tumor cell proliferation and spreading in 3D.

"""Proteomics reveals differentially regulated pathways when comparing grade 2 and 4 astrocytomas.""","""Astrocytic tumors are known for their high progression capacity and high mortality rates; in this regard, proteins correlated to prognosis can aid medical conduct. Although several genetic changes related to progression from grade 2 to grade 4 astrocytoma are already known, mRNA copies do not necessarily correlate with protein abundance and therefore could shadow further comprehension about this tumor's biology. This motivates us to seek for complementary strategies to study tumor progression at the protein level. Here we compare the proteomic profile of biopsies from patients with grade 2 (diffuse, n = 6) versus grade 4 astrocytomas (glioblastomas, n = 10) using shotgun proteomics. Data analysis performed with PatternLab for proteomics identified 5,206 and 6,004 proteins in the 2- and 4-grade groups, respectively. Our results revealed seventy-four differentially abundant proteins (p < 0.01); we then shortlist those related to greater malignancy. We also describe molecular pathways distinctly activated in the two groups, such as differences in the organization of the extracellular matrix, decisive both in tumor invasiveness and in signaling for cell division, which, together with marked contrasts in energy metabolism, are determining factors in the speed of growth and dissemination of these neoplasms. The degradation pathways of GABA, enriched in the grade 2 group, is consistent with a favorable prognosis. Other functions such as platelet degranulation, apoptosis, and activation of the MAPK pathway were correlated to grade 4 tumors and, consequently, unfavorable prognoses. Our results provide an important survey of molecular pathways involved in glioma pathogenesis for these histopathological groups.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37967105
"""Tropomyosin Tpm 2.1 loss induces glioblastoma spreading in soft brain-like environments.""","""Introduction: The brain is a very soft tissue. Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumours are highly infiltrative into the surrounding healthy brain tissue and invasion mechanisms that have been defined using rigid substrates therefore may not apply to GBM dissemination. GBMs characteristically lose expression of the high molecular weight tropomyosins, a class of actin-associating proteins and essential regulators of the actin stress fibres and focal adhesions that underpin cell migration on rigid substrates. Methods: Here, we investigated how loss of the high molecular weight tropomyosins affects GBM on soft matrices that recapitulate the biomechanical architecture of the brain. Results: We find that Tpm 2.1 is down-regulated in GBM grown on soft substrates. We demonstrate that Tpm 2.1 depletion by siRNA induces cell spreading and elongation in soft 3D hydrogels, irrespective of matrix composition. Tpm 1.7, a second high molecular weight tropomyosin is also down-regulated when cells are cultured on soft brain-like surfaces and we show that effects of this isoform are matrix dependent, with Tpm 1.7 inducing cell rounding in 3D collagen gels. Finally, we show that the absence of Tpm 2.1 from primary patient-derived GBMs correlates with elongated, mesenchymal invasion. Conclusions: We propose that Tpm 2.1 down-regulation facilitates GBM colonisation of the soft brain environment. This specialisation of the GBM actin cytoskeleton organisation that is highly suited to the soft brain-like environment may provide novel therapeutic targets for arresting GBM invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535593
"""High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) Predicts Invasion and Poor Prognosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme via Activating AKT Signaling in an Autocrine Pathway.""","""BACKGROUND As a nuclear protein and a secreted protein, HMGB1 is involved in many cellular processes such as proliferation, transcription, and inflammation. The overexpression of HMGB1 in various types of cancers is reported, but its clinical significance and prognostic value in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not been well defined. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of HMGB1 in 116 patients with GBM was investigated with immunohistochemistry, and was detected with qRT-PCR in 12 pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent tissues. The correlations between HMGB1 and clinicopathological factors were analyzed with the chi-square test. Prognostic value of HMGB1 was evaluated with univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. By knocking down HMGB1 by siRNA, the functions of HMGB1 in progression of GBM cell lines were investigated by experiments in vitro. RESULTS In our study, patients with high HMGB1 expression accounted for 42.2% of all the patients. High HMGB1 was correlated with low survival rates and was identified as an independent prognostic factor of GBM. Knockdown of intracellular HMGB1 remarkably decreased GBM cells proliferation and invasion. In hypoxia, intracellular HMGB1 of GBM cells was released out and activated AKT and ERK signaling pathways, thus promoting GBM cell invasion in this autocrine pathway. CONCLUSIONS HMGB1 is an independent prognostic biomarker for unfavorable prognosis of patients with GBM. Released HMGB1 of GBM cells can activate AKT and ERK signaling pathways and promote GBM cells invasion in this autocrine pathway, indicating that anti-HMGB1 therapy may be a promising treatment for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30531692
"""The tyrosine kinase pyk2 promotes migration and invasion of glioma cells.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is extraordinarily aggressive due to the propensity of cells to migrate away from the tumor core into the surrounding normal brain. In this report, we investigated the role of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and FAK with regard to influencing glioma cell phenotypes. Expression of Pyk2 stimulated glioma cell migration, whereas expression of FAK inhibited glioma cell migration and stimulated cell cycle progression. Pyk2 autophosphorylation was necessary, but not sufficient, to stimulate cellular migration. The N-terminal domain of Pyk2 is required for stimulation of migration as an N-terminally deleted variant of Pyk2 failed to stimulate migration, whereas expression of an autonomous Pyk2 N-terminal domain inhibited cell migration. Substitution of the C-terminal domain of Pyk2 with the corresponding domain of FAK stimulated cell migration as effectively as wild-type Pyk2; however, substitution of the N-terminal domain of Pyk2 with that of FAK inhibited cell migration, substantiating that the N-terminal domain of Pyk2 was required to stimulate migration. Silencing of Pyk2 expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited glioma migration. Cell migration was restored on re-expression of Pyk2, but expression of FAK in Pyk2 knockdown cells failed to restore migration. We conclude that Pyk2 plays a central role in the migratory behavior of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15967096
"""Inhibition of Bevacizumab-induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by BATF2 Overexpression Involves the Suppression of Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling in Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Background/aim: Bevacizumab (BV) has been used for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. However, it also induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioblastoma cells, which compromises its efficacy. BATF2 (basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 2), a multi-target transcriptional repressor, has been found to suppress cancer development partly through inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin singling. The roles of BATF2 and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in BV-induced EMT in glioblastoma cells were investigated in this study. Materials and methods: BV was used to treat U87MG cells, and TOP/FOP FLASH luciferase reporters were employed to determine the activity of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. EMT markers were detected with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to determine the compartmentation of Î²-catenin. Wound-healing, TransWell and ECIS assays were used to analyze cell adhesion, invasion and migration. Results: BV induced EMT phenotype in U87MG cells, and BATF2 overexpression significantly inhibited BV-induced EMT with suppression of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Conclusion: Our findings expanded the understanding of the role of BATF2 in tumors, and also suggested a potential of using BATF2 as a therapeutic target to hinder bevacizumab induced EMT in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28739720
"""Preserved function in brain invaded by tumor.""","""Objective: Intrinsic brain tumors can arise within regions of the cortex that are essential to language, motor, and somatosensory functions. Although it is commonly thought that such tumors can be safely resected, as long as the resection is limited to grossly abnormal cortex, functional mapping of the cerebral cortex during tumor resection does not support this contention. Methods: We report our experience with 14 patients (9 men, 5 women; median age, 43 yr) with intrinsic brain tumors of varying degrees of malignancy (four glioblastomas multiforme, four anaplastic astrocytomas, two anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, one anaplastic mixed glioma, three gangliogliomas). Cortical mapping was performed either intraoperatively (n = 11) or extraoperatively via intracranial electrodes (n = 3). Results: Tumors were found to grossly invade functioning cortices (frontal lobe language cortex, four tumors; temporal lobe language cortex, five tumors; motor cortex, four tumors; somatosensory cortex, one tumor). The gross invasion of functional cortex by tumor limited safe resection in all patients. Three patients experienced transient postoperative deficits caused by the proximity of the resection to functional cortex. One patient suffered a delayed postoperative hemorrhage, with resultant persistent motor aphasia. Conclusion: Intrinsic brain tumors grow by infiltration of normal brain. Consequently, brain that appears to be abnormal may remain functional, thus precluding safe tumor resection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8832661

Patients and methods: Serum samples were collected from 64 GBM patients and 64 healthy controls. The expression level of circulating miR-137 was compared by quantitative RT-PCR. Among GBM patients, circulating miR-137 was compared between patients at early stages and those at advanced stages. Also, the correlations of serum miR-137 expression with clinicopathological features and overall survival of GBM patients were statistically examined. Furthermore, whether circulating miR-137 could serve as an independent predicting biomarker GBM patients' survival was assessed. Results: Serum miR-137 was downregulated in GBM patients than in healthy controls. It was further downregulated in GBM patients at advanced stages than in patients at early stages. Statistical analysis demonstrated that low serum miR-137 level was strongly correlated with patients' clinical grades (p = 0.003) and KFS (p = 0.002). Low serum miR-137 was also found to be significantly correlated with, and may predict poor survival in GBM patients.

However, the pathophysiological roles of ZHX1 have not been characterized in glioblastoma. We examined ZHX1 expression in glioblastoma patients' tissues and analyzed overall survival of the patients based on expression level of ZHX1. We also examined the effects of ZHX1 on proliferation and motility of glioblastoma cells. In silico analysis and immunohistochemical studies showed that the messenger RNA and protein expressions of ZHX1 were higher in the tissues of glioblastoma patients than in normal brain tissues, and that its overexpression was associated with reduced survival. In vitro, the downregulation of ZHX1 decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells, whereas its upregulation had the opposite effects. In addition, we showed ZHX1 could contribute to glioblastoma progression via the regulations of TWIST1 and SNAI2. Taken together, this study demonstrates that ZHX1 plays crucial roles in the progression of glioblastoma, and its findings suggest that ZHX1 be viewed as a potential prognostic maker and therapeutic target of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28351300
"""Expression of invasion-related extracellular matrix molecules in human glioblastoma versus intracerebral lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.""","""Tumor cell invasion into the surrounding brain tissue is mainly responsible for the failure of radical surgical resection, with tumor recurrence in the form of microdisseminated disease. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-related molecules and their receptors predominantly participate in the invasion process, including cell adhesion to the surrounding microenvironment and cell migration. The extent of infiltration of the healthy brain by malignant tumors strongly depends on the tumor cell type. Malignant gliomas show much more intensive peritumoral invasion than do metastatic tumors. In this study, the mRNA expression of 30 invasion-related molecules (twenty-one ECM components, two related receptors, and seven ECM-related enzymes) was investigated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Fresh frozen human tissue samples from glioblastoma (GBM), intracerebral lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, and normal brain were evaluated. Significant differences were established for 24 of the 30 molecules. To confirm our results at the protein level, immunohistochemical analysis of seven molecules was performed (agrin, neurocan, syndecan, versican, matrix metalloproteinase 2 [MMP-2], MMP-9, and hyaluronan). Determining the differences in the levels of invasion-related molecules for tumors of different origins can help to identify the exact molecular mechanisms that facilitate peritumoral infiltration by glioblastoma cells.

"""Reactive Astrocytes in Glioblastoma Multiforme.""","""Despite the multidisciplinary integration in the therapeutic management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the prognosis of GBM patients is poor. There is growing recognition that the cells in the tumor microenvironment play a vital role in regulating the progression of glioma. Astrocytes are an important component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as well as the tripartite synapse neural network to promote bidirectional communication with neurons under physiological conditions. Emerging evidence shows that tumor-associated reactive astrocytes interact with glioma cells and facilitate the progression, aggression, and survival of tumors by releasing different cytokines. Communication between reactive astrocytes and glioma cells is further promoted through ion channels and ion transporters, which augment the migratory capacity and invasiveness of tumor cells by modifying H+ and Ca2+ concentrations and stimulating volume changes in the cell. This in part contributes to the loss of epithelial polarization, initiating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Therefore, this review will summarize the recent findings on the role of reactive astrocytes in the progression of GBM and in the development of treatment-resistant glioma. In addition, the involvement of ion channels and transporters in bridging the interactions between tumor cells and astrocytes and their potential as new therapeutic anti-tumor targets will be discussed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29363044
"""CD44 in human glioma correlates with histopathological grade and cell migration.""","""Glioblastomas are associated with high mortality due to their aggressive growth and invasiveness. Interactions and functional cross-talk between tumor cells and their microenvironments are mediated by cell surface receptors that are responsible for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. Central nervous tissues contain plenty of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan, and glioma cells express the major cell surface hyaluronan receptor, CD44. In this study, we analyzed the expression and roles of CD44 in human brain tissues. Normal brain tissues showed no or weak CD44 expression, while reactive astrocytes and astrocytoma cells expressed CD44 at variable levels. Immunohistochemically, a higher percentage and intensity of CD44-positive tumor cells were detected in high-grade astrocytomas compared with low-grade astrocytomas. Glioblastoma cells that express CD44 were localized in perivascular and perinecrotic lesions. The human glioma cell lines A172 and KG-1-C expressed CD44 mRNA and protein. Administration of monoclonal anti-human-CD44 antibody inhibited the migration of A172 cells, which are glioblastoma-derived, but did not affect cell growth. In conclusion, CD44 expression levels correlated with the histopathological grade of gliomas, and monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody inhibited the migration of glioblastoma cells.

"""Signaling switch of the urotensin II vasosactive peptide GPCR: prototypic chemotaxic mechanism in glioma.""","""Multiform glioblastomas (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. The poor prognosis is due to neo-angiogenesis and cellular invasion, processes that require complex chemotaxic mechanisms involving motility, migration and adhesion. Understanding these different cellular events implies identifying receptors and transduction pathways that lead to and promote either migration or adhesion. Here we establish that glioma express the vasoactive peptide urotensin II (UII) and its receptor UT and that UT-mediated signaling cascades are involved in glioma cell migration and adhesion. Components of the urotensinergic systems, UII and UT, are widely expressed in patient-derived GBM tissue sections, glioma cell lines and fresh biopsy explants. Interestingly, gradient concentrations of UII produced chemoattracting migratory/motility effects in glioma as well as HEK293 cells expressing human UT. These effects mainly involved the G13/Rho/rho kinase pathway while partially requiring Gi/o/PI3K components. In contrast, we observed that homogeneous concentrations of UII drastically blocked cell motility and stimulated cell-matrix adhesions through a UT/Gi/o signaling cascade, partially involving phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Finally, we provide evidence that, in glioma cells, homogeneous concentration of UII allowed translocation of GÎ±13 to the UT receptor at the plasma membrane and increased actin stress fibers, lamellipodia formation and vinculin-stained focal adhesions. UII also provoked a re-localization of UT precoupled to GÎ±i in filipodia and initiated integrin-stained focal points. Altogether, these findings suggest that UT behaves as a chemotaxic receptor, relaying a signaling switch between directional migration and cell adhesion under gradient or homogeneous concentrations, thereby redefining sequential mechanisms affecting tumor cells during glioma invasion. Taken together, our results allow us to propose a model in order to improve the design of compounds that demonstrate signaling bias for therapies that target specifically the Gi/o signaling pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25597409

Diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is a leading cause of therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic forward signalling. Surprisingly, ephrin-B2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, EFNB2 knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B2-blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27350048

The preparation of the nanoparticles resulted in spherical particles with high doxorubicin loading. The physico-chemical properties and the release of doxorubicin from the PIHCA-nanoparticles were analysed, and the influence on cell viability of the rat glioblastoma 101/8-cell line was investigated.

The goal of this study was to examine this relationship further. Methods: To investigate the relationship between GFAP expression and glial tumor cell behavior, the authors isolated clones from the human glioblastoma cell line, U-373MG, according to their level of GFAP expression. Immunochemical analysis demonstrated that one clone had consistently low GFAP expression (approximately 93% of cells were GFAP negative), whereas a second clone had consistently high GFAP expression (approximately 80% of the cells were GFAP positive). The structure, population doubling time, saturation density, anchorage-independent growth, migratory rate, and invasive potential of these two clones were determined in relation to their level of GFAP expression. Morphologically, both clones were composed of ameboid as well as stellate components. Although the population doubling times of the two clones were equally rapid, the clone with low GFAP expression demonstrated a slightly higher saturation density compared with the clone with high GFAP expression. In an anchorage-independent environment (soft agar), a greater difference in growth characteristics was noted between the two clones: the high-expression clone formed more colonies and these colonies were compact, well defined, and spherical, whereas the low-expression clone formed predominantly smaller, two-dimensional colonies with vague boundaries and isolated cells or groups of cells at the periphery. In contrast to these minor differences between the clones, the low-expression clone showed a markedly increased migratory rate and invasive potential compared with the high-expression clone. Therefore, the clone with reduced GFAP expression appeared more aggressive, demonstrating decreased contact inhibition, increased migratory rate, and increased invasive potential.

"""Molecular characteristics and clinical features of multifocal glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas (GBMs) usually occur as a solitary lesion; however, about 0.5-35% present with multiple lesions (M-GBM). The genetic landscape of GBMs have been thoroughly investigated; nevertheless, differences between M-GBM and single-foci GBM (S-GBM) remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine differences in clinical and molecular characteristics between M-GBM and S-GBM. Methods: A retrospective review of multifocal/multicentric infiltrative gliomas (M-IG) from our institutional database was performed. Demographics, clinical, radiological, and genetic features were obtained and compared between M-GBM IDH-wild type (IDH-WT) vs 193 S-GBM IDH-WT. Mutations were examined by a targeted next-generation sequencing assay interrogating 315 genes. Results: 33M-IG were identified from which 94% were diagnosed as M-GBM IDH-WT, the remaining 6% were diagnosed as astrocytomas IDH-mutant. M-GBM and S-GBM comparison revealed that EGFR alterations were more frequent in M-GBM (65% vs 42% p = 0.019). Furthermore, concomitant EGFR/PTEN alterations were more common in M-GBM vs. S-GBM (36% vs 19%) as well as compared to TCGA (21%). No statistically significant differences in overall survival were observed between M-GBM and S-GBM; however, within the M-GBM cohort, patients harboring KDR alterations had a worse survival (KDR-altered 6.7 vs KDR-WT 16.6 months, p = 0.038). Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrate that M-GBM genetically resembles S-GBM, however, M-GBM harbor higher frequency of EGFR alterations and co-occurrence of EGFR/PTEN alterations, which may account for their highly malignant and invasive phenotype. Further study of genetic alterations including differences between multifocal and multicentric GBMs are warranted, which may identify potential targets for this aggressive tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32440969

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized as losing cell polarity, plays an essential role in tumor invasion and metastasis. TGFÎ², a key member of transforming growth factors, has been demonstrated to contribute to glioblastoma aggressiveness through inducing EMT. Therefore, the present studies aim to investigate whether PF suppresses the expression of TGFÎ² and inhibits EMT that plays an important role in anti-glioblastoma. We found that PF dose-dependently downregulates the expression of TGFÎ², enhances apoptosis, reduces cell proliferation, migration and invasion in three human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U251, T98G). These effects are enhanced in TGFÎ² siRNA treated cells and abolished in cells transfected with TGFÎ² lentiviruses.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of DVST, potential predictive features on imaging, complications, its effect on survival, and time of greatest risk for developing DVST. Methods: A retrospective search of patients with GBM who had surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy between 2009 and 2015 at our institution was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain were reviewed on volumetric postgadolinium T1-weighted sequences for DVST. Tumors were characterized using the Visually Accessible REMBRANDT (Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) Images classification, and identified thromboses were tracked for propagation, regression, or resolution. Statistical analyses were directed at identifying clinical predictors and survival differences between the DVST and no-DVST groups. Results: In total, 163 cases totaling 1637 scans, were reviewed; 12 patients (7.4%) developed DVST, of whom 11 presented with thrombus before any treatment. Tumor invasion of dural sinuses and greater T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ratios were significantly associated with thrombus development (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). In patients who developed DVST, thrombosis was more likely to develop ipsilateral to tumor side (P = 0.01) and was associated with a greater likelihood of developing extracranial venous thromboembolism (P = 0.012). There were no venous infarcts and no significant difference in survival between groups (P = 0.83). Conclusions: Patients with GBM have increased risk of developing DVST, independent of surgical treatment or chemoradiation. DVST presence does not affect survival. Tumor invasion of dural sinuses and greater T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ratio on preoperative imaging were the most significant predictors of DVST development.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30684707

This latter offers a fine-granular differentiation of invasive profiles, facilitating a quantification independent of cell lines and experimental setups. Progression of density from the core towards the edges influences the resulting density map thus providing a measure no longer dependent on the sole area size of MCTS, but also on its invasiveness.

Our previous studies have shown that 14-3-3zeta has a positive expression and is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated whether 14-3-3zeta positive cells show more tumorigenic character and stronger chemotherapy resistance. Material and methods: Six human glioblastoma cells lines were derived from the 6 patients with tumor, and the cells were sorted by 14-3-3zeta expression. The cell viability, invasion, tumorigenic ability and chemotherapy resistance were compared between the 14-3-3 positive and negative expression groups. Results: 14-3-3zeta positive cells displayed oncogenic properties, more tumorigenic character, high invasiveness, tumorsphere formation ability and resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy treatment.

"""Recent advancements and theranostics strategies in glioblastoma therapy.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal malignant brain tumor, and it is challenging to cure with surgery and treatment. The prevention of permanent brain damage and tumor invasion, which is the ultimate cause of recurrence, are major obstacles in GBM treatment. Besides, emerging treatment modalities and newer genetic findings are helping to understand and manage GBM in patients. Accordingly, researchers are focusing on advanced nanomaterials-based strategies for tackling the various problems associated with GBM. In this context, researchers explored novel strategies with various alternative treatment approaches such as early detection techniques and theranostics approaches. In this review, we have emphasized the recent advancement of GBM cellular models and their roles in designing GBM therapeutics. We have added a special emphasis on the novel genetic and drug target findings as well as strategies for early detection. Besides, we have discussed various theranostic approaches such as hyperthermia therapy, phototherapy and image-guided therapy. Approaches utilized for targeted drug delivery to the GBM were also discussed.

"""Tat-NTS Suppresses the Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of Glioblastoma Cells by Inhibiting Annexin-A1 Nuclear Translocation.""","""Prevention of the nuclear translocation of ANXA1 with Tat-NTS was recently reported to alleviate neuronal injury and protect against cerebral stroke. However, the role that Tat-NTS plays in the occurrence and development of gliomas still needs to be elucidated. Therefore, human glioblastoma (GB) cells were treated with various concentrations of Tat-NTS for 24 h, and cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed with CCK-8 and Transwell assays. The nuclear translocation of ANXA1 was evaluated by subcellular extraction and immunofluorescence, and protein expression levels were detected by Western blot analysis. In addition, the activity of MMP-2/9 was measured by gelatin zymography. The results revealed that Tat-NTS significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of ANXA1 in U87 cells and inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GB cells. Tat-NTS also suppressed cell cycle regulatory proteins and MMP-2/-9 activity and expression. Moreover, Tat-NTS reduced the level of p-p65 NF-ÎºB in U87 cells. These results suggest that the Tat-NTS-induced inhibition of GB cell proliferation, migration and invasion is closely associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest, downregulation of MMP-2/-9 expression and activity and suppression of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Thus, Tat-NTS may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of GB.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34345995
"""Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase-4 Potentiates 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose-Induced Suppression of Glycolysis, Migration, and Invasion in Glioblastoma Cells: Role of the Akt/HIF1alpha/HK-2 Signaling Axis.""","""Aims: 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a synthetic glycolytic inhibitor, is currently under clinical evaluation as a promising anticancer agent. However, 2-DG treatment in cancer cells activates prosurvival Akt signaling that might limit its clinical efficacy. The NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox-4)/reactive oxygen species/Akt signaling is known to regulate survival, proliferation, infiltration, and invasion in glioblastomas (GBMs). The enhanced motility, invasiveness, and therapy resistance in GBMs are attributed to metabolic adaptation through increased aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of the Nox-4 might enhance 2-DG-induced suppression of glycolysis, migration, and invasion in GBM cells. Results: We identified the natural naphthoquinone compound shikonin as a potent inhibitor of the Nox-4/Akt signaling pathway. The combined treatment of shikonin+2-DG suppressed the glycolytic phenotype, migration, and invasion through modulation of the Akt/HIF1Î±/hexokinase-2 signaling axis in GBM cells. The combination also exhibited enhanced antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects in vivo. Innovation: Our data for the first time demonstrate that inhibition of the Nox-4-associated prosurvival signaling pathway by shikonin enhances the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic potential of 2-DG in GBM cells. Conclusion: In summary, the combined inhibition of Nox-4 and glycolysis may have therapeutic implications for the management of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25891245

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TRAF6 depression by miRNA could decrease GBM cell resistance to temozolomide, but the prognostic values of TRAF6 and its functions in GBM progression have not been elucidated. In our study, the expression of TRAF6 and matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP9) in 101 cases of GBM were investigated using immunohistochemistry. Twelve pairs of GBM frozen tissues and their corresponding adjacent tissues were collected during operation prospectively, and TRAF6 and MMP9 mRNA levels in them were detected using qRT-PCR. The correlations between TRAF6, MMP9, and clinicopathological factors were analyzed using the Chi-square test, and the prognostic value of TRAF6 and MMP9 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. The effect of TRAF6 and MMP9 on GBM cell invasion and proliferation was detected with experiments in vitro, and the correlation between TRAF6 and MMP9 expression was explored by regulating their expression with overexpression or knockdown. The expression of TRAF6 and MMP9 in GBM tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent tissues. The expression of TRAF6 and MMP9 was significantly associated in GBM tissues. Both TRAF6 and MMP9 correlated with poor prognosis of GBM, and TRAF6 was identified as an independent prognostic factor of GBM. TRAF6 could promote invasion instead of proliferation of GBM cells via elevating expression of MMP9.

"""Computational Trials: Unraveling Motility Phenotypes, Progression Patterns, and Treatment Options for Glioblastoma Multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis and high morbidity due to its invasiveness. Hypoxia-driven motility and concentration-driven motility are two mechanisms of glioblastoma multiforme invasion in the brain. The use of anti-angiogenic drugs has uncovered new progression patterns of glioblastoma multiforme associated with significant differences in overall survival. Here, we apply a mathematical model of glioblastoma multiforme growth and invasion in humans and design computational trials using agents that target angiogenesis, tumor replication rates, or motility. The findings link highly-dispersive, moderately-dispersive, and hypoxia-driven tumors to the patterns observed in glioblastoma multiforme treated by anti-angiogenesis, consisting of progression by Expanding FLAIR, Expanding FLAIR + Necrosis, and Expanding Necrosis, respectively. Furthermore, replication rate-reducing strategies (e.g. Tumor Treating Fields) appear to be effective in highly-dispersive and moderately-dispersive tumors but not in hypoxia-driven tumors. The latter may respond to motility-reducing agents. In a population computational trial, with all three phenotypes, a correlation was observed between the efficacy of the rate-reducing agent and the prolongation of overall survival times. This research highlights the potential applications of computational trials and supports new hypotheses on glioblastoma multiforme phenotypes and treatment options.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26756205

This study explored the role of HOXB13 in glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tissue with the highest aggressive rate and mortality in adults. Through microarray and immunohistochemistry analyses, HOXB13 was highly expressed in GBM tissues. Furthermore, we showed that high-level expression of HOXB13 in GBM was associated with worse survival, suggesting that HOXB13 could be a prognostic marker for patients with GBM. GBM cells U87 and U251 overexpressing HOXB13 showed enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion relative to the control cells, while knockdown of HOXB13 led to decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities. In addition, dual-luciferase report assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data showed that HOXB13 directly bound to HOXC-AS3 promoter. HOXC-AS3 was involved in HOXB13-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells. In summary, this study revealed the prognostic potential of HOXB13 in GBM.

"""Zeb1 potentiates genome-wide gene transcription with Lef1 to promote glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive brain tumor, with a subpopulation of stem-like cells thought to mediate its recurring behavior and therapeutic resistance. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducing factor Zeb1 was linked to tumor initiation, invasion, and resistance to therapy in glioblastoma, but how Zeb1 functions at molecular level and what genes it regulates remain poorly understood. Contrary to the common view that EMT factors act as transcriptional repressors, here we show that genome-wide binding of Zeb1 associates with both activation and repression of gene expression in glioblastoma stem-like cells. Transcriptional repression requires direct DNA binding of Zeb1, while indirect recruitment to regulatory regions by the Wnt pathway effector Lef1 results in gene activation, independently of Wnt signaling. Amongst glioblastoma genes activated by Zeb1 are predicted mediators of tumor cell migration and invasion, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prex1, whose elevated expression is predictive of shorter glioblastoma patient survival.

"""Microglial lysophosphatidic acid promotes glioblastoma proliferation and migration via LPA(1) receptor.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly aggressive primary brain tumors characterized by cellular heterogeneity, insensitivity to chemotherapy and poor patient survival. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lysophospholipid that acts as a bioactive signaling molecule and plays important roles in diverse biological events during development and disease, including several cancer types. Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, express high levels of Autotaxin (ATX,Enpp2), an enzyme that synthetizes LPA. Our study aimed to investigate the role of LPA on tumor growth and invasion in the context of microglia-GBM interaction. First, through bioinformatics studies, patient data analysis demonstrated that more aggressive GBM expressed higher levels of ENPP2, which was also associated with worse patient prognosis with proneural GBM. Using GBM-microglia co-culture system we then demonstrated that GBM secreted factors were able to increase LPA1 and ATX in microglia, which could be further enhanced by hypoxia. On the other hand, interaction with microglial cells also increased ATX expression in GBM. Furthermore, microglial-induced GBM proliferation and migration could be inhibited by pharmacological inhibition of LPA1 , suggesting that microglial-derived LPA could support tumor growth and invasion. Finally, increased LPA1 expression was observed in GBM comparing with other gliomas and could be also associated with worse patient survival. These results show for the first time a microglia-GBM interaction through the LPA pathway with relevant implications for tumor progression. A better understanding of this interaction can lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies setting LPA as a potential target for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32438456
"""Quantitative susceptibility mapping differentiates between blood depositions and calcifications in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Objectives: The application of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in brain tumor imaging is mainly used to assess tumor-related 'susceptibility based signals' (SBS). The origin of SBS in glioblastoma is still unknown, potentially representing calcifications or blood depositions. Reliable differentiation between both entities may be important to evaluate treatment response and to identify glioblastoma with oligodendroglial components that are supposed to present calcifications. Since calcifications and blood deposits are difficult to differentiate using conventional MRI, we investigated whether a new post-processing approach, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), is able to distinguish between both entities reliably. Materials and methods: SWI, FLAIR, and T1-w images were acquired from 46 patients with glioblastoma (14 newly diagnosed, 24 treated with radiochemotherapy, 8 treated with radiochemotherapy and additional anti-angiogenic medication). Susceptibility maps were calculated from SWI data. All glioblastoma were evaluated for the appearance of hypointense or hyperintense correlates of SBS on the susceptibility maps. Results: 43 of 46 glioblastoma presented only hyperintense intratumoral SBS on susceptibility maps, indicating blood deposits. Additional hypointense correlates of tumor-related SBS on susceptibility maps, indicating calcification, were identified in 2 patients being treated with radiochemotherapy and in one patient being treated with additional anti-angiogenic medication. Histopathologic reports revealed an oligodendroglial component in one patient that presented calcifications on susceptibility maps. Conclusions: QSM provides a quantitative, local MRI contrast, which reliably differentiates between blood deposits and calcifications. Thus, quantitative susceptibility mapping appears promising to identify rare variants of glioblastoma with oligodendroglial components non-invasively and may allow monitoring the role of calcification in the context of different therapy regimes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23555565

In this study, the anticancer properties of VPA on neural crest-derived human tumor cell lines G361 melanoma, U87MG glioblastoma and SKNMC Askin tumor cells were investigated. The effect of VPA on cell growth, apoptotic activity and invasive ability were evaluated. Firstly, VPA induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic activity, as demonstrated by sulforhodamine B protein assay, annexin V assay and by Western blot analysis for Bcl2 and Bax expression levels, in all three cell lines. In addition, VPA led to a decrease of HDAC-1 protein level, as assessed by Western blot analysis. Treatment with VPA caused a decrease in the invasive ability of all three cell lines. Since the invasion process involves a complex system of tightly regulated proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue-specific inhibitors (TIMPs), the effect of VPA on MMP and TIMP expressions was analysed. Exposure to VPA resulted in a decrease of MMP2 and MMP9 activity and expression level, as assesssed by gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis. In addition, exposure to VPA led to enhanced expression of TIMP1, as assessed by Western blot. Taken together, our results, besides providing further evidence that VPA may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment, may help in the design of new protocols geared at the treatment of neural crest-derived tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20332466

In this context, Annexin 2A (ANXA2) is a phospholipid-binding protein expressed in a variety of cell types, whose expression has been recently associated with cell dissemination and metastasis in many cancer types, thus making ANXA2 an attractive putative regulator of cell invasion also in GBM.Here we show that ANXA2 is over-expressed in GBM and positively correlates with tumor aggressiveness and patient survival. In particular, we associate the expression of ANXA2 to a mesenchymal and metastatic phenotype of GBM tumors. Moreover, we functionally characterized the effects exerted by ANXA2 inhibition in primary GBM cultures, demonstrating its ability to sustain cell migration, matrix invasion, cytoskeletal remodeling and proliferation. Finally, we were able to generate an ANXA2-dependent gene signature with a significant prognostic potential in different cohorts of solid tumor patients, including GBM.In conclusion, we demonstrate that ANXA2 acts at multiple levels in determining the disseminating and aggressive behaviour of GBM cells, thus proving its potential as a possible target and strong prognostic factor in the future management of GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27429043

Native and acid-activatable cathepsin L activities were highest in glioblastomas followed by anaplastic astrocytomas and were lowest in low-grade gliomas and normal brain tissues. Significantly higher amounts of an M(r) 29,000 cathepsin L were present in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas than in normal brain tissues and low-grade glioma tissue extracts.

Strong c-Met expression was found in tumor cells, blood vessels, and peri-necrotic areas. At the subcellular level, c-Met was identified in the cytoplasm and in the cell membrane. Measurements of high c-Met intensity correlated with high WHO grade (p = 0.006) but no association with survival was observed in patients with WHO grade II (p = 0.09) or III (p = 0.17) tumors. High expression of c-Met was associated with shorter overall survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (p = 0.03). However the prognostic effect of c-Met in glioblastomas was time-dependent and only observed in patients who survived more than 8.5 months, and not within the first 8.5 months after diagnosis.

"""Targeting role of glioma stem cells for glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is known to be the most common and lethal malignant primary brain tumor. Despite vigorous basic and clinical studies over the past decades, the prognosis of patients with GBM has remained dismal. The fundamental problem with these malignancies occurs due to tumor cells' highly infiltrative nature, precluding a complete surgical resection, and a productive or acquired resistance to cytotoxic therapy. Recent studies demonstrated that GBMs exhibited remarkable cellular heterogeneity and hierarchy containing self-renewing glioma stem cells (GSCs). The malignant growth of GBM can be propagated and sustained by GSCs that are endowed with highly efficient clonogenic and tumor initiation capacities. GSCs can be identified with technical support and are responsible for the invasive potential and recurrence of GBMs. They share core signaling pathways with normal neural stem cells, but also display critical distinctions that provide important clues for useful therapeutic targets. Therefore, targeting GSCs becomes priorities for the development of novel therapeutic paradigms. Herein, we reviewed the existing and promising targeting therapies for GSCs which could effectively inhibit the tumor invasion, proliferation and recurrence of GBMs. Significant features of GSCs, such as invasive growth pattern, angiogenic potential, resistance to traditional therapy and differentiation, are important therapeutic targets. More promising strategies should target GSCs themselves by taking advantages of highthroughput technologies and dissecting the intrinsic molecular nature of GSCs. Novel chemical medicines targeting these GSCs may represent one of the most important directions.

"""A novel extracellular Hsp90 mediated co-receptor function for LRP1 regulates EphA2 dependent glioblastoma cell invasion.""","""Background: Extracellular Hsp90 protein (eHsp90) potentiates cancer cell motility and invasion through a poorly understood mechanism involving ligand mediated function with its cognate receptor LRP1. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents one of the most aggressive and lethal brain cancers. The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 is overexpressed in the majority of GBM specimens and is a critical mediator of GBM invasiveness through its AKT dependent activation of EphA2 at S897 (P-EphA2(S897)). We explored whether eHsp90 may confer invasive properties to GBM via regulation of EphA2 mediated signaling. Principal findings: We find that eHsp90 signaling is essential for sustaining AKT activation, P-EphA2(S897), lamellipodia formation, and concomitant GBM cell motility and invasion. Furthermore, eHsp90 promotes the recruitment of LRP1 to EphA2 in an AKT dependent manner. A finding supported by biochemical methodology and the dual expression of LRP1 and P-EphA2(S897) in primary and recurrent GBM tumor specimens. Moreover, hypoxia mediated facilitation of GBM motility and invasion is dependent upon eHsp90-LRP1 signaling. Hypoxia dramatically elevated surface expression of both eHsp90 and LRP1, concomitant with eHsp90 dependent activation of src, AKT, and EphA2. Significance: We herein demonstrate a novel crosstalk mechanism involving eHsp90-LRP1 dependent regulation of EphA2 function. We highlight a dual role for eHsp90 in transducing signaling via LRP1, and in facilitating LRP1 co-receptor function for EphA2. Taken together, our results demonstrate activation of the eHsp90-LRP1 signaling axis as an obligate step in the initiation and maintenance of AKT signaling and EphA2 activation, thereby implicating this pathway as an integral component contributing to the aggressive nature of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21408136

In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA-613 expression was frequently reduced in human cytomegalovirus-positive glioblastoma specimens/cells compared with human cytomegalovirus-negative glioblastoma tissue/cells, and a significant correlation was observed between the reduction in microRNA-613 expression and the presence of unfavourable variables, including tumour size (p = 0.0118), World Health Organization stage (p = 0.0169), the overall survival (p = 0.0107) and disease-free (p = 0.0159) survival of patients. Overexpression of microRNA-613 in the glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 retarded cell growth and induced cell apoptosis. Upregulation of microRNA-613 inhibited glioblastoma cell clone formation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that arginase-2 was directly regulated by microRNA-613 and played an essential role in mediating the biological effects of microRNA-613 in glioblastoma. Re-expression of arginase-2 markedly reversed the inhibitory properties of microRNA-613 in glioblastoma cells.

"""['Vicious circles' of glioblastoma tumors: vascularization and invasiveness].""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and a particularly aggressive form of glial primary brain tumors. This malignancy accounts for ca. 70% of all diagnosed cases. Unfortunately, average survival of glioma patients does not exceed one year from diagnosis. Specific vascularization pattern (presence of numerous microvessels and glomerular vessels) and exceptional invasiveness are characteristic features of glioblastoma tumors. Both of these features reflect complex underlying processes forming two vicious circles. Common to both of these circles is the state of tumor underoxygenation. Hypoxia that occurs in the vicinity of abnormal tumor blood vessels stimulates formation of novel microvessels and invasiveness of tumor cells. In their essence, both of the vicious circles are processes allowing tumor cells to adapt to an underoxygenated tumor milieu. These processes play an important role in tumor progression, which reflects a specific type of evolution of cancer cells. Late effects of this evolution include appearance of highly aggressive, chemo- and radiotherapy resistant neoplastic cells. Increased adaptation capabilities of such cancer cells have a negative influence on the therapeutic process. Effective therapeutic strategies should not be directed against single cancer cell markers; instead, they should be targeted so as to break both vicious cycles. Herein we discuss several such strategies. In our opinion, effective therapeutic approaches must include a combination of several agents that recognize and simultaneously break both vicious cycles, i.e. vascularization and invasiveness. Also, agents that decrease hypoxia in cancer cells, for example drugs inhibiting activity of HIF-1Î±, might also prove therapeutically effective in such approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23175345

In the short-term follow-up, one transient supplementary motor area syndrome, one epileptic seizure, and one cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred. All were successfully managed. Post-procedure MRI showed no complication, satisfying treatment volume, and a decrease in size of the treated tumor. For all patients, recurrence was observed with a mean/median progression free survival of 37/30 days. Mean/median overall survival after LITT was 10.5/10 months. Conclusion: Focal tumor control was performed safely using minimally invasive LITT with real-time MRTI control. LITT could be considered as salvage therapy for high-grade recurrent gliomas if a 1-day treatment is considered useful for a few weeks gain in survival. Larger experience will be required to define indications for such infiltrative disease and accurately determine a potentially significant survival gain in good neurological condition associated with this 1-day procedure.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22488658
"""Extracellular proteolysis in glioblastoma progression and therapeutics.""","""Gliomas encompass highly invasive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours of glial cell origin with an often-poor clinical prognosis. Of all gliomas, glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of primary brain cancer. Current treatments in glioblastoma are insufficient due to the invasive nature of brain tumour cells, which typically results in local tumour recurrence following treatment. The latter represents the most important cause of mortality in glioblastoma and underscores the necessity for an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Interestingly, increased synthesis and secretion of several proteolytic enzymes within the tumour microenvironment, such as matrix metalloproteinases, lysosomal proteases, cathepsins and kallikreins for extracellular-matrix component degradation may play a major role in the aforementioned glioblastoma invasion mechanisms. These proteolytic networks are key players in establishing and maintaining a tumour microenvironment that promotes tumour cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Indeed, the targeted inhibition of these proteolytic enzymes has been a promisingly useful therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma management in both preclinical and clinical development. We hereby summarize current advances on the biology of the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment, with a particular emphasis on the role of proteolytic enzyme families in glioblastoma invasion and progression, as well as on their subsequent prognostic value as biomarkers and their therapeutic targeting in the era of precision medicine.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956761
"""A foretaste for pediatric glioblastoma therapy: targeting the NF-kB pathway with DHMEQ.""","""Purpose: While pediatric glioblastomas are molecularly distinct from adult counterparts, the activation of NF-kB is partially shared by both subsets, playing key roles in tumor propagation and treatment response. Results: We show that, in vitro, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) impairs growth and invasiveness. Xenograft response to the drug alone varied according to the model, being more effective in KNS42-derived tumors. In combination, SF188-derived tumors were more sensitive to temozolomide while KNS42-derived tumors responded better to the combination with radiotherapy, with continued tumor regression.

"""Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and VEGF upregulate CXCR4 in glioblastoma: implications for angiogenesis and glioma cell invasion.""","""Hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) play a critical role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs). CXCR4 is involved in angiogenesis and is upregulated by HIF-1alpha. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)alpha, also known as CXCL12. We hypothesized that CXCR4 would be upregulated by hypoxia in GBMs. First, we investigated the expression of HIF-1alpha and CXCR4 in GBMs. CXCR4 was consistently found colocalized with HIF-1alpha expression in pseudopalisading glioma cells around areas of necrosis. In addition, angiogenic tumor vessels were strongly positive for CXCR4. Next, we tested the in vitro effect of hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the expression of CXCR4 in glioma cell lines and in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Exposure to hypoxia induced significant expression of CXCR4 and HIF-1alpha in glioma cells, whereas treatment with exogenous VEGF increased CXCR4 expression in HBMECs. We also transfected U87MG glioma cells with an HIF-1alpha construct and observed that CXCR4 was upregulated in these cells even in normoxic conditions. We then used a lentivirus-mediated shRNA expression vector directed against HIF-1alpha. When exposed to hypoxia, infected cells failed to show HIF-1alpha and CXCR4 upregulation. We performed migration assays under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in the presence or absence of AMD3100, a CXCR4 inhibitor. There was a significant increase in the migration of U87MG and LN308 glioma cells in hypoxic conditions, which was inhibited in the presence of AMD3100. These studies demonstrate the critical role played by hypoxia and CXCR4 in glioma cell migration. Based on these studies, we suggest that hypoxia regulates CXCR4 in GBMs at two levels. First, through HIF-1alpha in the pseudopalisading tumor cells themselves and, secondly, by the VEGF-stimulated angiogenic response in HBMECs. We believe this knowledge may lead to a potentially important two-pronged therapy against GBM progression using chemotherapy targeting CXCR4.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17075581
"""SNAI1 is involved in the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common type of astrocytoma in the brain. Due to its high invasiveness and chemoresistance, patients with advanced stage of glioblastoma have a poor prognosis. SNAI1, an important regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, has been associated with metastasis in various carcinoma cells. However, its roles in glioblastoma cells have been poorly characterized. To examine roles of SNAI1 in glioblastoma cells, we knockdowned SNAI1 expression using siRNA. SNAI1 siRNA increased the expression level of E-cadherin and decreased that of vimentin. In the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, SNAI1 siRNA inhibited the proliferation of U87-MG and GBM05 glioblastoma cells. Moreover, in the Boyden chamber assay and Matrigel invasion assay, SNAI1 siRNA inhibited serum-induced migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells.

"""Rnd3 Is a Crucial Mediator of the Invasive Phenotype of Glioblastoma Cells Downstream of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling.""","""Enhanced invasiveness is one of the defining biological traits of glioblastoma cells, which exhibit an infiltrative nature that severely hinders surgical resection. Among the molecular lesions responsible for GBM aggressiveness, aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling is well-characterised. Enhanced RTK signalling directly impacts a myriad of cellular pathways and downstream effectors, which include the Rho GTPase family, key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Here, we have analysed the functional crosstalk between oncogenic signals emanating from RTKs and Rho GTPases and focused on the specific contribution of Rnd3 to the invasive phenotype of GBM in this context. We found that RTK inhibition with a panel of RTK inhibitors decreased cell motility and cell invasion and promoted dramatic actin cytoskeleton reorganisation through activation of the RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK) axis. RTK inhibition also significantly decreased Rnd3 expression levels. Consistently, shRNA-mediated Rnd3 silencing revealed that Rnd3 depletion promoted substantial changes in the actin cytoskeleton and reduced cell motility and invasion capacity, recapitulating the effects observed upon RTK inhibition. Our results indicate that Rnd3 is a crucial mediator of RTK oncogenic signalling involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganisation, which contributes to determining the invasive phenotype of GBM cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36496976

"""Apoptosis and p53 expression in human gliomas.""","""Twenty-five human gliomas of different histological grade and type were studied for p53 expression by immunohistochemistry and for apoptosis using ApopTag method. p53 expression (percentage of positive cells) was highest in anaplastic astrocytomas, followed by low grade astrocytomas and surprisingly in glioblastomas. Granular cytoplasmic p53 positivity appeared in 4/5 low grade oligodendroglioma and in 2/5 low grade mixed oligoastrocytomas. The means of apoptosis index in the different tumor types ranged between 0.8 and 11.5 with the highest values in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastomas. Although the number of cases per group were relatively low and the individual vales showed differences it seems that p53 expression is related to the biological aggressiveness of gliomas. It is also suggested that high level of apoptosis in malignant glioma could represent a p53 independent pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9887356
"""Increased DNA repair capacity augments resistance of glioblastoma cells to photodynamic therapy.""","""Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved cancer therapy of low invasiveness. The therapeutic procedure involves administering a photosensitizing drug (PS), which is then activated with monochromatic light of a specific wavelength. The photochemical reaction produces highly toxic oxygen species. The development of resistance to PDT in some cancer cells is its main limitation. Several mechanisms are known to be involved in the development of cellular defense against cytotoxic effects of PDT, including activation of antioxidant enzymes, drug efflux pumps, degradation of PS, and overexpression of protein chaperons. Another putative factor that plays an important role in the development of resistance of cancer cells to PDT seems to be DNA repair; however, it has not been well studied so far. To explore the role of DNA repair and other potential novel mechanisms associated with the resistance to PDT in the glioblastoma cells, cells stably resistant to PDT were isolated from PDT sensitive cells following repetitive PDT cycles. Duly characterization of isolated PDT-resistant glioblastoma revealed that the resistance to PDT might be a consequence of several mechanisms, including higher repair efficiency of oxidative DNA damage and repair of DNA breaks. Higher activity of APE1 endonuclease and increased expression and activation of DNA damage kinase ATM was demonstrated in the U-87 MGR cell line, suggesting and proving that they are good targets for sensitization of resistant cells to PDT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34044336
"""Caveolin-1, caveolae, and glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor and is characterized by high invasiveness, poor prognosis, and limited therapeutic options. Biochemical and morphological experiments have shown the presence of caveolae in glioblastoma cells. Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma membrane subdomains that play trafficking, mechanosensing, and signaling roles. Caveolin-1 is a membrane protein that participates in the formation of caveolae and binds a multitude of signaling proteins, compartmentalizing them in caveolae and often directly regulating their activity via binding to its scaffolding domain. Caveolin-1 has been proposed to behave either as a tumor suppressor or as an ongogene depending on the tumor type and progress. This review discusses the existing information on the expression and function of caveolin-1 and caveolae in GBM and the role of this organelle and its defining protein on cellular signaling, growth, and invasiveness of GBM.

Materials and methods: T2-weighted images were acquired preoperatively in 22 treatment-naÃ¯ve GBM patients. Two groups were formed based on the expression levels of CXCR4. A third group of normal volunteers was used for comparison. Each image was segmented to obtain four different clusters for tissue types identified as white matter, basal ganglia, gray matter/edema and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/tumor. Signal intensity histograms were formed for each cluster and compared between groups. Results: In every cluster the GBM groups displayed significantly higher standard deviations of intensity distributions when compared to normal subjects. Significant differences in skewness were found between normal subjects and GBM patients in the white matter, basal ganglia, and CSF/tumor. Further, when the two groups of GBM patients were compared the CXCR4-high group was found to have a significant shift in the median intensity values in the cluster containing gray matter and peritumoral edema.

The scores on both scales were higher in GBM patients than in healthy controls. For each scale, GBM patients were divided into high- and low-score groups based on the average score. The prognosis was poorer for GBM patients in the high-score groups than for those in the low-score groups. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that tumor necrosis was more prevalent among high-scored GBM patients. Cellular experiments were performed on primary GBM cells from patients with either high or low scores on both scales. Sphere formation, EdU and wound healing assays revealed greater proliferation and invasion capacities in GBM cells from patients with high scores on both scales. Western blotting assay revealed significantly different expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers between the two groups.

"""Matrix metalloproteinase-2 regulates vascular patterning and growth affecting tumor cell survival and invasion in GBM.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one the most aggressive brain tumors due to the fast and invasive growth that is partly supported by the presence of extensive neovascularization. The matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 has been associated with invasive and angiogenic properties in gliomas and is a marker of poor prognosis. Since MMP-2 is expressed in both tumor cells and endothelial cells in GBM, we generated genetically engineered MMP-2 knockout (MMP-2ko) GBM to examine the importance of the spatial expression of MMP-2 in tumor and/or normal host-derived cells. MMP-2-dependent effects appeared to be dose-dependent irrespective of its expression pattern. GBM completely devoid of MMP-2 exhibited markedly increased vascular density associated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) activation and enhanced vascular branching and sprouting. Surprisingly, despite the high vascular density, tumor cells were more prone to apoptosis, which led to prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the increased vascularity is not functional. Congruently, tumor vessels were poorly perfused, exhibited lower levels of VEGFR2, and did not undergo proper maturation because pericytes of MMP-2ko tumors were not activated and were less abundant. As a result of impaired and dysfunctional angiogenesis, MMP-2ko GBM became more invasive, predominantly by migrating along blood vessels into the brain parenchyma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18359864

Identification and quantification of spatially localized brain regions undergoing high rates of cell migration and proliferation is critical for improving patient survival; however, there are currently no non-invasive imaging biomarkers for estimating proliferation and migration rates of human gliomas in vivo. To accomplish this, we developed CIMPLE (cell invasion, motility, and proliferation level estimates) image maps using serial diffusion MRI scans and a solution to a glioma growth model equation. CIMPLE represent a novel method of quantifying the level of aggressive malignant behavior. In the current pilot study, we demonstrate the utility of CIMPLE maps to predict progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 26 recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab from our Neuro-Oncology database. Voxel-wise estimates of cell proliferation rate predicted spatial regions of contrast enhancement in 35% of patients. A linear correlation was found between the mean proliferation rate and progression-free survival (PFS; P < 0.0001) as well as overall survival (OS; P = 0.0093).

"""miR-494-3p Regulates Cellular Proliferation, Invasion, Migration, and Apoptosis by PTEN/AKT Signaling in Human Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and the molecular mechanisms involving their progression and recurrence are still largely unclear. Substantial data indicate that the oncogene miR-494-3p is significantly elevated in gliomas, but the molecular functions of miR-494-3p in gliomagenesis are largely unknown. The present study aimed to explore the role of miR-494-3p and its molecular mechanism in human brain gliomas, malignant glioma cell lines, and cancer stem-like cells. The expression level of miR-494-3p in 48 human glioma issues and 8 normal brain tissues was determined using stem-loop real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To study the function of miR-494-3p inhibitor in glioma cells, the miR-494-3p inhibitor lentivirus was used to transfect glioma cells. Transwell invasion system was used to estimate the effects of miR-494-3p inhibitor on the invasiveness of glioma cells. A mouse model was used to test the effect of miR-494-3p inhibitor on glioma proliferation and invasion in vivo. Results showed that the expression of miR-494-3p in human brain glioma tissues was higher than in normal brain tissues. Downregulated expression of miR-494-3p can inhibit the invasion and proliferation and promote apoptosis in glioma cells. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression of PTEN was increased after downexpression of miR-494-3p in glioma cells (U87 and U251). miR-494-3p inhibitor could prevent migration, invasion, proliferation, and promote apotosis in gliomas through PTEN/AKT pathway.

"""A Ras inhibitor tilts the balance between Rac and Rho and blocks phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent glioblastoma cell migration.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme are highly aggressive tumors for which no adequate treatment has yet been developed. Glioblastoma multiforme show large amounts of active Ras, considered an appropriate target for directed therapy. Here, we show that the Ras inhibitor S-trans, trans-farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) can avert the transformation of human glioblastoma multiforme cells by inhibiting both their migration and their anchorage-independent proliferation. FTS, by down-regulating Ras activity in glioblastoma multiforme cells, inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, resulting in decreased activity of Rac-1. At the same time, activation of RhoA was increased. These two small GTPases are known to control the arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. By tilting the balance between Rac-1 and RhoA activities, FTS caused the glioblastoma multiforme cells to undergo profound changes in morphology, including rearrangement of actin into stress fibers and assembly of focal adhesions, both of which are governed by RhoA signaling. These morphologic changes allowed strong attachment of the cells to the matrix, rendering them immobile. The results show that FTS should be considered as a candidate drug for glioblastoma multiforme therapy because it targets not only cell proliferation but also cell migration and invasion, which together constitute the most problematic aspect of these malignancies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17178866

Method: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science; the articles were screened for relevance and then subjected to full text review. Technical terms were consolidated. Results: We identified 12 studies on MRE in patients with intracranial tumors, including meningiomas, glial tumors including glioblastomas, vestibular schwannomas, hemangiopericytoma, central nervous system lymphoma, pituitary macroadenomas, and brain metastases. The studies had varying objectives that included prediction of intraoperative consistency, histological separation, prediction of adhesiveness, and exploration of the mechanobiology of tumor invasiveness and malignancy.

The current study investigated the anti-brain cancer potential of 50% ethanolic extract of Tinospora cordifolia (TCE) using C6 glioma cells. TCE significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent manner and induced differentiation in C6 glioma cells, resulting in astrocyte-like morphology as indicated by phase contrast images, GFAP expression and process outgrowth data of TCE treated cells which exhibited higher number and longer processes than untreated cells. Reduced proliferation of cells was accompanied by enhanced expression of senescence marker, mortalin and its translocation from perinuclear to pancytoplasmic spaces. Further, TCE showed anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential as depicted by wound scratch assay and reduced expression of plasticity markers NCAM and PSA-NCAM along with MMP-2 and 9.

We have previously established that human glioma cells are exquisitely sensitive to IL-1 stimulation leading us to undertake a comparative analysis of the secretome of unstimulated and cytokine (IL-1)-stimulated glioblastoma cells. We performed label-free quantitative proteomic analysis and detected 190 proteins which included cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix (ECM) and related proteins. Measuring area under the curve (AUC) of peptides for quantitation, the IL-1-induced secretome contained 13 upregulated and 5 downregulated extracellular proteins (p<0.05) compared to controls. Of these, IL-8, CCL2, TNC, Gal-1 and PTX3 were validated as upregulated and SERPINE1, STC2, CTGF and COL4A2 were validated as downregulated factors by immunochemical methods. A major representation of the ECM and related proteins in the glioblastoma secretome and their modulation by IL-1 suggested that IL-1 induces its effect in part by altering TGFÎ² expression, activity and signaling. These findings enhance our understanding of IL-1-induced modulation of glioma microenvironment, with implications for increased tumor invasion, migration and angiogenesis. They further provide novel targets for the glioblastoma intervention. Biological significance: Present study is on an unbiased screening of the glioblastoma secretome stimulated by IL-1 which triggers neuroinflammatory cascades in the central nervous system.

Uncontrolled proliferation and abnormal cell migration are two prominent spatially and temporally disassociated characteristics of GBMs. In this study, we investigated the role of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 in controlling the proliferation/migration dichotomy of GBM. We studied EphB2 gain of function and loss of function in glioblastoma-derived stem-like neurospheres, whose in vivo growth pattern closely replicates human GBM. EphB2 expression stimulated GBM neurosphere cell migration and invasion, and inhibited neurosphere cell proliferation in vitro. In parallel, EphB2 silencing increased tumor cell proliferation and decreased tumor cell migration. EphB2 was found to increase tumor cell invasion in vivo using an internally controlled dual-fluorescent xenograft model. Xenografts derived from EphB2-overexpressing GBM neurospheres also showed decreased cellular proliferation. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was found to be co-associated with and highly activated by EphB2 expression, and FAK activation facilitated focal adhesion formation, cytoskeleton structure change and cell migration in EphB2-expressing GBM neurosphere cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that EphB2 has pro-invasive and anti-proliferative actions in GBM stem-like neurospheres mediated, in part, by interactions between EphB2 receptors and FAK. These novel findings suggest that tumor cell invasion can be therapeutically targeted by inhibiting EphB2 signaling, and that optimal antitumor responses to EphB2 targeting may require concurrent use of anti-proliferative agents.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22310282
"""NCoR controls glioblastoma tumor cell characteristics.""","""Background: We have previously shown that the transcriptional coregulator NCoR represses astrocytic differentiation of neural stem cells, suggesting that NCoR could be a plausible target for differentiation therapy of glioblastoma. Methods: To study a putative role for NCoR in regulating glioblastoma cell characteristics, we used RNA-mediated knockdown followed by analysis of gene expression, proliferation and cell growth, autophagy, invasiveness in vitro, and tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. We further performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of NCoR followed by genome-wide sequencing in the human glioblastoma cell line U87 in order to reveal NCoR-occupied loci. Results: RNA knockdown of NCoR resulted in a moderate increase in differentiation accompanied by a significant decrease in proliferation in adherent U87 human glioblastoma cells. chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing approach revealed alternative mechanisms underlying the decrease in proliferation, as NCoR was enriched at promoters of genes associated with autophagy such as ULK3. Indeed, signs of an autophagy response in adherent glioblastoma cells included an increased expression of autophagy genes, such as Beclin1, and increased lipidation and nuclear puncta of LC3. Intriguingly, in parallel to the effects in the adherent cells, NCoR knockdown resulted in a significant increase in anchorage-independent growth, and this glioblastoma cell population showed dramatic increases in invasive properties in vitro and tumor formation capacity in vitro and in vivo along with an increased proliferation rate. Conclusion: Our results unveil unexpected aspects of NCoR regulation of tumor characteristics in glioblastoma cells and highlight the need for caution when transposing developmental concepts directly to cancer therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24335696
"""Small extracellular vesicles promote invadopodia activity in glioblastoma cells in a therapy-dependent manner.""","""Purpose: The therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy/temozolomide treatment for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the augmented invasiveness mediated by invadopodia activity of surviving GBM cells. As yet, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Due to their ability to transport oncogenic material between cells, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have emerged as key mediators of tumour progression. We hypothesize that the sustained growth and invasion of cancer cells depends on bidirectional sEV-mediated cell-cell communication. Methods: Invadopodia assays and zymography gels were used to examine the invadopodia activity capacity of GBM cells. Differential ultracentrifugation was utilized to isolate sEVs from conditioned medium and proteomic analyses were conducted on both GBM cell lines and their sEVs to determine the cargo present within the sEVs. In addition, the impact of radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment of GBM cells was studied. Results: We found that GBM cells form active invadopodia and secrete sEVs containing the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2. Subsequent proteomic studies revealed the presence of an invadopodia-related protein sEV cargo and that sEVs from highly invadopodia active GBM cells (LN229) increase invadopodia activity in sEV recipient GBM cells. We also found that GBM cells displayed increases in invadopodia activity and sEV secretion post radiation/temozolomide treatment. Together, these data reveal a relationship between invadopodia and sEV composition/secretion/uptake in promoting the invasiveness of GBM cells. Conclusions: Our data indicate that sEVs secreted by GBM cells can facilitate tumour invasion by promoting invadopodia activity in recipient cells, which may be enhanced by treatment with radio-chemotherapy. The transfer of pro-invasive cargos may yield important insights into the functional capacity of sEVs in invadopodia.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37014551
"""The MET oncogene is a functional marker of a glioblastoma stem cell subtype.""","""The existence of treatment-resistant cancer stem cells contributes to the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma. However, the molecular alterations that drive stem cell proliferation in these tumors remain unknown. In this study, we found that expression of the MET oncogene was associated with neurospheres expressing the gene signature of mesenchymal and proneural subtypes of glioblastoma. Met expression was almost absent from neurospheres expressing the signature of the classical subtype and was mutually exclusive with amplification and expression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) gene. Met-positive and Met-negative neurospheres displayed distinct growth factor requirements, differentiated along divergent pathways, and generated tumors with distinctive features. The Met(high) subpopulation within Met-pos neurospheres displayed clonogenic potential and long-term self-renewal ability in vitro and enhanced growth kinetics in vivo. In Met(high) cells, the Met ligand HGF further sustained proliferation, clonogenicity, expression of self-renewal markers, migration, and invasion in vitro. Together, our findings suggest that Met is a functional marker of glioblastoma stem cells and a candidate target for identification and therapy of a subset of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22738909
"""Ruta graveolens, but Not Rutin, Inhibits Survival, Migration, Invasion, and Vasculogenic Mimicry of Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor, characterized by poor outcome and limited therapeutic options. During tumor progression, GBM may undergo the process of vasculogenic mimicry (VM), consisting of the formation of vascular-like structures which further promote tumor aggressiveness and malignancy. The resulting resistance to anti-angiogenetic therapies urges the identification of new compounds targeting VM. Extracts of natural plants may represent potential therapeutic tools. Among these, components of Ruta graveolens water extract (RGWE) display a wide range of biological activities. To test the effect of RGWE on human GBM and rat glioma cell line VM, tube formation on a gelled matrix was monitored. Quantitative assessment of VM formation shows the clear-cut inhibitory activity of RGWE. Unlike rutin, one of the most abundant extract components, the whole RGWE strongly reduced the migration and invasion of GBM tumor cells. Moreover, RGWE induced cell death of GBM patient-derived cancer stem cells and impaired VM at sub-lethal doses. Overall, our data reveal a marked RGWE-dependent inhibition of GBM cell survival, migration, invasion, and VM formation. Thus, the clear-cut ability of RGWE to counteract GBM malignancy deserves attention, holding the promise to bring natural products to clinical use, thus uncovering new therapeutic opportunities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39519339
"""Expression of integrin alpha v beta 3 in small blood vessels of glioblastoma tumors.""","""Angiogenesis, which promotes tumor proliferation and invasiveness, is mediated by integrin-dependent cell adhesion mechanisms and requires expression of integrin alpha v beta 3. To determine whether integrin alpha v beta 3 is expressed in the small blood vessel hyperplasia characteristic of glioblastoma tumors, we explored the mRNA and protein expression of integrin alpha v, beta 3, beta 5, and beta 1 subunits in small blood vessels in gliomas of various grades and nontumorous brain biopsies. Antisense beta 3 and beta 5 riboprobes hybridized to small blood vessels (endothelial and adjacent mesenchymal cells) in 11 of 11 glioblastomas and 2 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, but failed to hybridize to small blood vessels in 12 non-neoplastic specimens and 4 low-grade astrocytomas. In contrast, antisense alpha v and beta 1 riboprobes hybridized to small blood vessels in all of the biopsies. The expression of integrin alpha v beta 3 protein in these vessels was determined by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-integrin subunit-specific antibodies. The findings were similar to those obtained using in situ hybridization: beta 3 subunit protein was detected on small blood vessels in 9 of 12 glioblastoma and 2 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, whereas it was not detected in small blood vessels of 10 non-neoplastic brains and 4 low-grade astrocytomas. In contrast, the alpha v and beta 1 subunit proteins were detected in small blood vessels in all of the brain biopsies, whereas the beta 5 subunit protein could not be detected. These data suggest that integrin alpha v beta 3 is expressed in small blood vessels of glioblastoma tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8939197
"""The impact of 'search precision' in an agent-based tumor model.""","""Several cell surface receptors are overexpressed in malignant brain tumors and reportedly involved in tumor progression and invasion. It is unclear, however, whether such an improvement of cellular signal reception leads to a monotonic increase in the tumor system's average velocity during invasion or whether there is a maximum threshold beyond which the average velocity starts to decelerate. To gain more insight into the systemic effects of such cellular search precision modulations, this study proposes a two-dimensional agent-based model in which the spatio-temporal expansion of malignant brain tumor cells is guided by environmental heterogeneities in mechanical confinement, toxic metabolites and nutrient sources. Here, the spatial field of action is represented by an adaptive grid lattice, which corresponds to the experimental finding that tumor cells are more likely to follow each other along preformed pathways. Another prominent feature is the dual threshold concept for both nutrient level and toxicity, which determine whether cells proliferate, migrate, remain quiescent or die in the next period. The numerical results from varying the key parameters encoding the capability of tumor cells to invade and their ability to proliferate indicate an emergent behavior. Specifically, increasing invasiveness not only leads to an increase in maximum expansion velocity, but also requires a more precise spatial search process, corresponding to an improved cell signal reception, in order to obtain maximum velocity. To increase cellular invasiveness beyond the maximum that can be achieved by exclusively tuning the motility parameter, it requires an additional reduction in the cells' proliferation rate and prompts an even more biased search process. Most interestingly, however, a prominent phase transition suggests that tumor cells do not employ a 100 percent search precision to attain maximum spatial velocity. These findings argue for a selection advantage conferred by limited randomness in processing spatial search and indicate that our computational platform may prove valuable in investigating emergent, multicellular tumor patterns caused by alterations on the molecular level.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12941591
"""Transcriptional modulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor subunits in glioblastoma by MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitors and their role in invasion.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor. Glioblastoma cells secrete a significant amount of glutamate, which serve as a potential growth factor in glioma pathobiology through their specific receptor subtypes including Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Glioblastoma express AMPAR subunits; however, its regulation and activation with downstream intracellular signaling are not well-understood. Phosphorylated-extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 is known to regulate the ionotropic glutamate receptors in cortical neurons. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is frequently activated in several tumors, including glioma. Nonetheless, the association of ERK signaling with AMPAR subunits in glioblastoma is undetermined. Here, we demonstrated potential role of AMPAR in invasion, and the modulation of AMPAR subunits at transcript level by ERK signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibition of ERK signaling specifically downregulated the expression of calcium-permeable AMPAR subunits, GluA1 and GluA4, and upregulated calcium-impermeable AMPAR subunit GluA2 implying differential regulation of the expression of calcium-permeable AMPAR subunits of glioblastoma. Concomitantly, it significantly decreased the invasion of U87MG cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the AMPAR enhances invasion of glioblastoma, and ERK signaling modulates the differential expression of calcium-permeable AMPAR phenotype that might play a crucial role in the invasive propensity of glioblastoma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31814223
"""Heparan Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans in Glioblastoma Promote Tumor Invasion.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor of adults and confers a poor prognosis due, in part, to diffuse invasion of tumor cells. Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans, present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, regulate cell signaling pathways and cell-microenvironment interactions. In GBM, the expression of HS glycosaminoglycans and the enzymes that regulate their function are altered, but the actual HS content and structure are unknown. However, inhibition of HS glycosaminoglycan function is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for some cancers. In this study, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to demonstrate differences in HS disaccharide content and structure across four patient-derived tumorsphere lines (GBM1, 5, 6, 43) and between two murine tumorsphere lines derived from murine GBM with enrichment of mesenchymal and proneural gene expression (mMES and mPN, respectively) markers. In GBM, the heterogeneous HS content and structure across patient-derived tumorsphere lines suggested diverse functions in the GBM tumor microenvironment. In GBM5 and mPN, elevated expression of sulfatase 2 (SULF2), an extracellular enzyme that alters ligand binding to HS, was associated with low trisulfated HS disaccharides, a substrate of SULF2. In contrast, other primary tumorsphere lines had elevated expression of the HS-modifying enzyme heparanase (HPSE). Using gene editing strategies to inhibit HPSE, a role for HPSE in promoting tumor cell adhesion and invasion was identified. These studies characterize the heterogeneity in HS glycosaminoglycan content and structure across GBM and reveal their role in tumor cell invasion.Implications: HS-interacting factors promote GBM invasion and are potential therapeutic targets.

U87 cells are wild-type p53 glioblastoma cells and U251 cells contain mutant p53. DHA inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. DHA promoted reactive oxygen species production and activated p53 in two glioma cell lines, U87 and U251. In U87 cells, DHA significantly up-regulated the expression of p-Î²-catenin (S45) and inhibited EGFR, Î²-catenin, p-Î²-catenin (Y333) and matrix metalloprotease7/9 activity. In U251 cells, DHA significantly up-regulated p-Î²-catenin (S45), p-Î²-catenin (Y333) and EGFR, but the expression of Î²-cateninwas unchanged. We also found that DHA and sh-Î²-catenin prevented the proliferation of U87 and U251 cells in vivo.

"""Hypoxia can induce c-Met expression in glioma cells and enhance SF/HGF-induced cell migration.""","""The c-Met receptor and its ligand scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) are strongly overexpressed in malignant gliomas. Signaling through c-Met as well as exposure to hypoxia can stimulate glioma cell migration and invasion. In several cancer cell types, hypoxia was shown to activate the c-met promoter, which contains hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding sites. We hypothesized that hypoxia might upregulate c-Met also in glioma cells. Analyzing 18 different glioblastoma cell lines and 10 glioblastoma primary cultures, we found that in 50% of both the cell lines and the primary cultures c-Met protein levels were increased following exposure to hypoxia. Upregulation of c-met in response to hypoxia was also detected at the transcriptional level. In all primary cultures and in 16 of the 18 cell lines (89%), HIF-1 alpha levels were increased by hypoxia. Transfection of siRNA against HIF-1 alpha abgrogated the hypoxic induction of c-Met, suggesting that c-Met expression is upregulated by a HIF-1 alpha-dependent mechanism. Hypoxia sensitized glioblastoma cell lines which showed hypoxic induction of c-Met to the motogenic effects of SF/HGF. These findings suggest that approximately half of all human glioblastomas respond to hypoxia with an induction of c-Met, which can enhance the stimulating effect of SF/HGF on tumor cell migration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17372907

Vitexin has shown activities against esophageal, liver, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers; however, there is little knowledge on the activity of vitexin against glioblastoma. This study was therefore designed with aims to examine the effects of vitexin on proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of human U251 glioblastoma cells and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using mRNA sequencing and molecular docking. Vitexin was found to inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion and promote apoptosis in U251 cells. mRNA sequencing identified 499 differentially expressed genes in vitexin-treated U251 cells relative to controls, including 154 upregulated genes and 345 downregulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were most significantly enriched in intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and the downregulated genes were most significantly enriched in positive regulation of cell development and positive regulation of locomotion relating to biological processes, endoplasmic reticulum lumen and side of membrane relating to cellular components, and receptor ligand activity and receptor regulator activity relating to molecular functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were involved in the pathways of transcriptional misregulation in cancer and the downregulated genes were involved in FoxO and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Western blotting assay revealed that vitexin treatment resulted in reduced p-JAK1, p-JAK3, and p-STAT3 protein expression in U251 cells relative to untreated controls, and molecular docking predicted that vitexin had docking scores of -8.8, -10.8, and -10.5 kJ/mol with STAT3, JAK1, and JAK2, respectively. The results of the present study demonstrate that vitexin inhibits the proliferation and invasion and induces the apoptosis of glioblastoma U251 cells through suppressing the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, and vitexin may be a promising potential agent for the chemotherapy of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35281458

The effects of HL156A, alone and combined with TMZ, on the stemness and invasive properties of GBM TSs and survival of orthotopic xenograft animals were assessed. HL156A, combined with TMZ, inhibited the stemness of GBM TSs, proven by neurosphere formation assay and marker expression. Three-dimensional collagen matrix invasion assays provided evidence that combined treatment inhibited invasive properties, compared with control and TMZ-alone treatment groups. TMZ alone and combined treatment repressed the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes. A gene ontology comparison of TMZ and combination-treatment groups revealed altered expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular adhesion and migration. Combined treatment with HL156A and TMZ showed survival benefits in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model.

Methods: We compared levels of IKIP between glioma tissues and normal brain tissue in clinical samples and public databases. We examined the effects of IKIP overexpression and knockdown on the migration and invasion of GBM using transwell and wound healing assays, and we compared the transcriptomes under these different conditions to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: Based on data from our clinical samples and from public databases, IKIP was overexpressed in GBM tumors, and its expression level correlated inversely with survival. IKIP overexpression in GBM cells inhibited migration and invasion in transwell and wound healing assays, whereas IKIP knockdown exerted the opposite effects. IKIP overexpression in GBM cells that were injected into mouse brain promoted tumor growth but inhibited tumor invasion of surrounding tissue.

"""Disruption of intracerebral progression of C6 rat glioblastoma by in vivo treatment with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody.""","""Object: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) invasiveness is a complex process that involves recognition and attachment of GBM cells to particular extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules before migrating into proteolytically modified matrix and inducing angiogenesis. The CD44 molecule, which is a transmembrane adhesion molecule found on a wide variety of cells including GBM, has been suggested as the principal mediator of migration and invasion. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether an antibody specific to the standard form of CD44 (CD44s, 85-90 kD) might prevent invasion and thus disrupt progression of C6 GBM in vivo. Methods: Immunostaining demonstrated homogeneous expression of CD44s on the surface of C6 GBM cells and tumors. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated binding saturation of anti-CD44s monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the receptor at 1 microg/5 x 10(5) cells. Blocking of CD44s in vitro resulted in a dose-dependent progressive (up to 94+/-2.7%; mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) detachment of C6 cells from ECM-coated culture. Blocking of CD44s in vivo resulted in significantly reduced C6 brain tumors (3.6+/-0.4% [SD])--measured as the quotient: tumor surface (mm2)/brain surface (mm2) x 100--compared with untreated (19.9+/-0.9%) or sham-treated (19.2+/-1.1 to 19.3+/-2.5% [SD]) rats.

"""Identification of genomic biomarkers and their pathway crosstalks for deciphering mechanistic links in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a grade IV pernicious neoplasm occurring in the supratentorial region of brain. As its causes are largely unknown, it is essential to understand its dynamics at the molecular level. This necessitates the identification of better diagnostic and prognostic molecular candidates. Blood-based liquid biopsies are emerging as a novel tool for cancer biomarker discovery, guiding the treatment and improving its early detection based on their tumour origin. There exist previous studies focusing on the identification of tumour-based biomarkers for glioblastoma. However, these biomarkers inadequately represent the underlying pathological state and incompletely illustrate the tumour because of non-recursive nature of this approach to monitor the disease. Also, contrary to the tumour biopsies, liquid biopsies are non-invasive and can be performed at any interval during the disease span to surveil the disease. Therefore, in this study, a unique dataset of blood-based liquid biopsies obtained primarily from tumour-educated blood platelets (TEP) is utilised. This RNA-seq data from ArrayExpress is acquired comprising human cohort with 39 glioblastoma subjects and 43 healthy subjects. Canonical and machine learning approaches are applied for identification of the genomic biomarkers for glioblastoma and their crosstalks. In our study, 97 genes appeared enriched in 7 oncogenic pathways (RAF-MAPK, P53, PRC2-EZH2, YAP conserved, MEK-MAPK, ErbB2 and STK33 signalling pathways) using GSEA, out of which 17 have been identified participating actively in crosstalks. Using PCA, 42 genes are found enriched in 7 pathways (cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, translation factors, electron transport chain, ribosome, Huntington's disease, primary immunodeficiency pathways, and interferon type I signalling pathway) harbouring tumour when altered, out of which 25 actively participate in crosstalks. All the 14 pathways foster well-known cancer hallmarks and the identified DEGs can serve as genomic biomarkers, not only for the diagnosis and prognosis of Glioblastoma but also in providing a molecular foothold for oncogenic decision making in order to fathom the disease dynamics. Moreover, SNP analysis for the identified DEGs is performed to investigate their roles in disease dynamics in an elaborated manner.

Targeting these cells thus represents a novel treatment strategy and therefore more specific markers that characterize glioblastoma stem cells need to be identified. In the present study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of glioblastoma tissues compared to normal brain tissues revealing sensible up-regulation of CD9 gene. CD9 encodes the transmembrane protein tetraspanin which is involved in tumor cell invasion, apoptosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Using the public REMBRANDT database for brain tumors, we confirmed the prognostic value of CD9, whereby a more than two fold up-regulation correlates with shorter patient survival. We validated CD9 gene and protein expression showing selective up-regulation in glioblastoma stem cells isolated from primary biopsies and in primary organotypic glioblastoma spheroids as well as in U87-MG and U373 glioblastoma cell lines. In contrast, no or low CD9 gene expression was observed in normal human astrocytes, normal brain tissue and neural stem cells. CD9 silencing in three CD133+ glioblastoma cell lines (NCH644, NCH421k and NCH660h) led to decreased cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and self-renewal ability, and altered expression of the stem-cell markers CD133, nestin and SOX2. Moreover, CD9-silenced glioblastoma stem cells showed altered activation patterns of the Akt, MapK and Stat3 signaling transducers. Orthotopic xenotransplantation of CD9-silenced glioblastoma stem cells into nude rats promoted prolonged survival.

In U87MG cell line, inhibition of H3R by siRNA or the antagonist ciproxifan (CPX) suppressed proliferation, invasiveness, and the expression of EMT activators (Snail, Slug and Twist). In addition, expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and ZO-1) was up-regulated and expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and N-cadherin) was down-regulated in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. In addition, we also showed that inhibition of H3R by siRNA or CPX inactivated the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, while inhibition of Akt or ERK activity with antagonists or siRNAs suppressed H3R agonist (R)-(Î±)-(-)- methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH) mediated invasion and reorganization of cadherin-household.

Recent studies demonstrate that GBM contains a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell characteristics, including self-renewal and multipotentiality, and that these cancer stem cells contribute to disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNA molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance. An accumulating body of evidence shows that miR-218 may act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting glioblastoma invasion, migration, proliferation and stemness through its different targets, indicating the great potential and relevance of miR-218 as a novel class of therapeutic target in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25042866
"""Lactate dehydrogenases promote glioblastoma growth and invasion via a metabolic symbiosis.""","""Lactate is a central metabolite in brain physiology but also contributes to tumor development. Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults, recognized by angiogenic and invasive growth, in addition to its altered metabolism. We show herein that lactate fuels GB anaplerosis by replenishing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in absence of glucose. Lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB), which we found spatially expressed in GB tissues, catalyze the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate. However, ablation of both LDH isoforms, but not only one, led to a reduction in tumor growth and an increase in mouse survival. Comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed metabolic rewiring involving high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the LDHA/B KO group which sensitized tumors to cranial irradiation, thus improving mouse survival. When mice were treated with the antiepileptic drug stiripentol, which targets LDH activity, tumor growth decreased. Our findings unveil the complex metabolic network in which both LDHA and LDHB are integrated and show that the combined inhibition of LDHA and LDHB strongly sensitizes GB to therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36278433
"""Prospective identification of glioblastoma cells generating dormant tumors.""","""Although dormant tumors are highly prevalent within the human population, the underlying mechanisms are still mostly unknown. We have previously identified the consensus gene expression pattern of dormant tumors. Here, we show that this gene expression signature could be used for the isolation and identification of clones which generate dormant tumors. We established single cell-derived clones from the aggressive tumor-generating U-87 MG human glioblastoma cell line. Based only on the expression pattern of genes which were previously shown to be associated with tumor dormancy, we identified clones which generate dormant tumors. We show that very high expression levels of thrombospondin and high expression levels of angiomotin and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), together with low levels of endothelial specific marker (ESM) 1 and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) characterize the clone which generates dormant U-87 MG derived glioblastomas. These tumors remained indolent both in subcutaneous and orthotopic intracranial sites, in spite of a high prevalence of proliferating cells. We further show that tumor cells which form U-87 MG derived dormant tumors have an impaired angiogenesis potential both in vitro and in vivo and have a slower invasion capacity. This work demonstrates that fast-growing tumors contain tumor cells that when isolated will form dormant tumors and serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of transcriptome profiles in the identification of such cells. Isolating the tumor cells that form dormant tumors will facilitate understanding of the underlying mechanisms of dormant micro-metastases, late recurrence, and changes in rate of tumor progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22970208
"""Cellular density effect on RGD ligand internalization in glioblastoma for MRI application.""","""Cellular density is a parameter measured for glioma grade and invasiveness diagnosis. The characterization of the cellular density can be performed, non invasively, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), since, this technique displays a good resolution. Nevertheless MRI sensitivity is critical. Development of smart contrast agents appears useful to increase MRI signal to noise ratio (SNR). Tumor invasiveness is correlated with high expression of integrins that can be targeted by RGD motif. In this study, MRI contrast agents or fluorescent probes linked to RGD-peptides were used, in a glioma model, to assess the relation between RGD uptake/signal improvement/cell density and consequently tumor invasiveness. Experiments were performed in vitro with U87-MG glioma cells. Flow cytometry and microscopy experiments with RGD and iRGD-alexa488 demonstrated that cell internalization was dependent on cell density. The internalization involved a clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Cytoskeleton and particularly the microtubules were concerned. Actin filaments played a minor role. The internalization was also dependent on the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylations. The cellular density modulated the importance of the endocytosis pathways and of the metabolism but not the cytoskeleton contribution. The internalization of the RGD-peptide associated to gadolinium chelate increased the SNR of U87 cells. Moreover, following the cell density augmentation, the SNR increased with a low amplitude but a trend was clearly determined. In conclusion, RGD-peptide internalization appeared, in vitro, as a marker of cellular density. In perspective, the combination of these peptides with contrast agents associated to more sensitive MRI techniques could improve the MRI signal allowing the characterization of cellular density for tumor diagnosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24386117
"""Combined Applications of Repurposed Drugs and Their Detrimental Effects on Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Background/aim: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor with high rates of recurrence. This study aimed to investigate the effect of repurposed drug combinations on GBM. Materials and methods: Viability of U87 MG and 11ST patient-derived GMB cell lines, after valproic acid, tranylcypromine or riluzole alone, in different combinations, as well as combined with standard temozolomide chemotherapy was examined using the MTT assay. Proliferation, mRNA level of tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), and cell invasion were evaluated using anti-Ki-67 antibody staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and xCELLigence system. Results: The strongest effect on cell viability was achieved by the combination of riluzole with valproic acid (U87MG: 27.2%, 11ST: 25.99%). Tranylcypromine significantly enhanced the effect of temozolomide when used in combination, as did valproic acid. The normally high proliferation of GBM significantly declined under treatment with valproic acid with tranylcypromine (p=0.01). Finally, we observed reduction of invasion comparing single tranylcypromine to its combination with valproic acid or riluzole.

"""Enhancing dendritic cell-based vaccination for highly aggressive glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM) have a dismal prognosis despite standard therapy, which can induce potentially deleterious side effects. Arming the immune system is an alternative therapeutic approach, as its cellular effectors and inherent capacity for memory can be utilized to specifically target invasive tumor cells, while sparing collateral damage to otherwise healthy brain parenchyma. Areas covered: Active immunotherapy is aimed at eliciting a specific immune response against tumor antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the most potent activators of de novo and recall immune responses and are thus a vehicle for successful immunotherapy. Currently, investigators are optimizing DC vaccines by enhancing maturation status and migratory potential to induce more potent antitumor responses. An update on the most recent DC immunotherapy trials is provided. Expert opinion: Targeting of unique antigens restricted to the tumor itself is the most important parameter in advancing DC vaccines. In order to overcome intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion observed in GBM, the future of DC-based therapy lies in a multi-antigenic vaccine approach. Successful targeting of multiple antigens will require a comprehensive understanding of all immunologically relevant oncological epitopes present in each tumor, thereby permitting a rational vaccine design.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25327832
"""Pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99m Tc-(V)DMSA] brain scintitomography--a plausible non-invasive depicter of glioblastoma proliferation and therapy response.""","""The biological behavior and prognosis of gliomas depend largely on cellular proliferation, resistance to chemotherapy, and metastatic potential. Proliferative propensity has significant implications on patient management but its assessment requires tissue sampling; the non-invasive estimation of brain tumor proliferation represents therefore a major goal. Pentavalent technetium-99 m dimercapto-succinic acid [99m Tc-(V)DMSA] is a tumor-seeking radiotracer displaying affinity for gliomas; its intracellular accumulation is directly linked to cell proliferation. We performed a tomographic 99m Tc-(V)DMSA brain scan in a 35-year-old male baring a recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, to depict its proliferative disposition. The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate. No improvement was ascertained the following months and radiographic assessment verified tumor progression. Scintitomography revealed avid radiotracer uptake in the entirety of the lesion (the distribution of radioactivity closely conforming to the morphological tumor boundaries), an indication that the neoplasm demonstrated no substantial proliferation decline in response to imatinib. The patient deceased a few weeks later. Mounting in vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that 99m Tc-(V)DMSA is a credible non-invasive proliferation depicter, its cellular accumulation linked closely to phosphate uptake and kinase pathway activation. A potential role in patient management, prognosis estimation, and therapy response monitoring could occur for this tracer.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17554495
"""Expression and localization of scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor in human astrocytomas.""","""Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been implicated in glioma invasion and angiogenesis. The SF/HGF receptor, MET, has been found to be expressed in neoplastic astrocytes as well as in endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature. Both SF/HGF and MET expression have also been described to correlate with the malignancy grade of human gliomas. However, most glioblastoma cell lines lack SF/HGF expression, raising the question of the cellular origin of SF/HGF in vivo. Using in situ hybridization, we analyzed glioblastomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, diffuse astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, and normal brain for the expression of SF/HGF mRNA. We detected strong SF/HGF expression by the majority of the tumor cells and by vascular endothelial cells in all glioblastoma specimens analyzed. Combined use of in situ hybridization with fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirmed the astrocytic origin of the SF/HGF-expressiong cells. In contrast, CD68-immunoreactive microglia/macrophages, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells reactive to alpha-smooth muscle actin, lacked SF/HGF expression. In anaplastic, diffuse, and pilocytic astrocytomas, SF/HGF expression was confined to a subset of tumor cells, and signals were less intense than in glioblastomas. In addition, we detected SF/HGF mRNA in cortical neurons. SF/HGF expression was not up regulated around necroses or at tumor margins. MET immunoreactivity was observed in GFAP-expressing astrocytic tumor cells and endothelial cells as well as in a subset of microglia/macrophages. We conclude that in vivo, both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of tumor cells and endothelium through the SF/HGF-MET system are likely to contribute to tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Lack of SF/HGF expression by most cultured glioblastoma cells is not representative of the in vivo situation and most likely represents a culture artifact.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11296484

Herein, we describe an efficiently biodegradable selenium-engineered mesoporous silica nanocapsule, initiated by high-energy X-ray irradiation and employed for at-site RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit rrGBM invasion and achieve maximum therapeutic benefit. Our radiation-triggered RNAi nanocapsule showed high physiological stability, good blood-brain barrier transcytosis, and potent rrGBM accumulation. An intratumoral RNAi nanocapsule permitted low-dose X-ray radiation-triggered dissociation for cofilin-1 knockdown, inhibiting rrGBM infiltration. More importantly, tumor suppression was further amplified by electron-affinity aminoimidazole products converted from metronidazole polymers under X-ray radiation-exacerbated hypoxia, which sensitized cell apoptosis to ionizing radiation by fixing reactive oxygen species-induced DNA lesions. In vivo experiments confirmed that our RNAi nanocapsule reduced tumor growth and invasion, prolonging survival in an orthotopic rrGBM model. Generally, we present a promising radiosensitizer that would effectively improve rrGBM-patient outcomes with low-dose X-ray irradiation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759969
"""Clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells is associated with brain tumour progression.""","""Tumour progression is a fundamental feature of the biology of cancer. Cancers do not arise de novo in their final form, but begin as small, indolent growths, which gradually acquire characteristics associated with malignancy. In the brain, for example, low-grade tumours (astrocytomas) evolve into faster growing, more dysplastic and invasive high-grade tumours (glioblastomas). To define the genetic events underlying brain tumour progression, we analysed the p53 gene in ten primary brain tumour pairs. Seven pairs consisted of tumours that were high grade both at presentation and recurrence (group A) and three pairs consisted of low-grade tumours that had progressed to higher grade tumours (group B). In group A pairs, four of the recurrent tumours contained a p53 gene mutation; in three of them, the same mutation was found in the primary tumour. In group B pairs, progression to high grade was associated with a p53 gene mutation. A subpopulation of cells were present in the low-grade tumours that contained the same p53 gene mutation predominant in the cells of the recurrent tumours that had progressed to glioblastoma. Thus, the histological progression of brain tumours was associated with a clonal expansion of cells that had previously acquired a mutation in the p53 gene, endowing them with a selective growth advantage. These experimental observations strongly support Nowell's clonal evolution model of tumour progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1311419

This is called the Warburg effect, and it promotes tumorigenesis and malignant progression. In this study, we demonstrated that EZH2, a multifaceted oncogenic protein involved in tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis, promotes glioblastoma tumorigenesis and malignant progression through activation of the Warburg effect. We observed that HIF1Î± is a target of EZH2 whose activation is necessary for EZH2-mediated metabolic adaption, and that HIF1Î± is activated upon EZH2 overexpression. EZH2 suppressed expression of EAF2, which in turn upregulated HIF1Î± levels.

Cultured U251 glioma cells were incubated with CCL18 and then subjected to transwell. The scratch wound-healing and cell count kit (CCK-8) assays were performed to detect the possible effects of CCL18 on the cell invasion, migration, and proliferation.

"""A role for GLUT3 in glioblastoma cell invasion that is not recapitulated by GLUT1.""","""The multifaceted roles of metabolism in invasion have been investigated across many cancers. The brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly invasive and metabolically plastic tumor with an inevitable recurrence. The neuronal glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) was previously reported to correlate with poor glioma patient survival and be upregulated in GBM cells to promote therapeutic resistance and survival under restricted glucose conditions. It has been suggested that the increased glucose uptake mediated by GLUT3 elevation promotes survival of circulating tumor cells to facilitate metastasis. Here we suggest a more direct role for GLUT3 in promoting invasion that is not dependent upon changes in cell survival or metabolism. Analysis of glioma datasets demonstrated that GLUT3, but not GLUT1, expression was elevated in invasive disease. In human xenograft derived GBM cells, GLUT3, but not GLUT1, elevation significantly increased invasion in transwell assays, but not growth or migration. Further, there were no changes in glycolytic metabolism that correlated with invasive phenotypes. We identified the GLUT3 C-terminus as mediating invasion: substituting the C-terminus of GLUT1 for that of GLUT3 reduced invasion. RNA-seq analysis indicated changes in extracellular matrix organization in GLUT3 overexpressing cells, including upregulation of osteopontin. Together, our data suggest a role for GLUT3 in increasing tumor cell invasion that is not recapitulated by GLUT1, is separate from its role in metabolism and survival as a glucose transporter, and is likely broadly applicable since GLUT3 expression correlates with metastasis in many solid tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33843470
"""The Candidate Tumor Suppressor Gene SLC8A2 Inhibits Invasion, Angiogenesis and Growth of Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most aggressive brain tumor in adults. Solute carrier family 8 member 2 (SLC8A2) is only expressed in normal brain, but not present in other human normal tissues or in gliomas. Therefore, we hypothesized that SLC8A2 might be a glioma tumor suppressor gene and detected the role of SLC8A2 in glioblastoma and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. The glioblastoma U87MG cells stably transfected with the lentivirus plasmid containg SLC8A2 (U87MG-SLC8A2) and negative control (U87MG-NC) were constructed. In the present study, we found that the tumorigenicity of U87MG in nude mice was totally inhibited by SLC8A2. Overexpression of SLC8A2 had no effect on cell proliferation or cell cycle, but impaired the invasion and migration of U87MG cells, most likely through inactivating the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway, inhibiting the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), reducing the level of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)-its receptor (uPAR) system (ERK1/2-NF-ÎºB-MMPs/uPA-uPAR), and altering the protein levels of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT)-associated proteins E-cardherin, vimentin and Snail. In addition, SLC8A2 inhibited the angiogenesis of U87MG cells, probably through combined inhibition of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-nondependent angiogenesis (vascular mimicry pattern).

"""Tetraarsenic oxide-induced inhibition of malignant glioma cell invasion in vitro via a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase secretion and protein kinase B phosphorylation.""","""Object: Local invasiveness of malignant glioma is a major reason for the failure of current treatments including surgery and radiation therapy. Tetraarsenic oxide (As4O6 [TAO]) is a trivalent arsenic compound that has potential anticancer and antiangiogenic effects in selected cancer cell lines at a lower concentration than arsenic trioxide (As2O3 [ATO]), which has been more widely tested in vitro and in vivo. The authors tried to determine the cytotoxic concentration of TAO in malignant glioma cell lines and whether TAO would show anti-invasive effects under conditions independent of cell death or apoptosis. Methods: The human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient malignant glioma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, and U373MG together with PTEN-functional LN428 were cultured with a range of micromolar concentrations of TAO. The invasiveness of the glioma cell lines was analyzed. The effect of TAO on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP expression was measured using gelatin zymography and Western blot, respectively. Akt, or protein kinase B, activity, which is a downstream effector of PTEN, was assessed with a kinase assay using glycogen synthesis kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) as a substrate and Western blotting of phosphorylated Akt. Results: Tetraarsenic oxide inhibited 50% of glioma cell proliferation at 6.3-12.2 Î¼M. Subsequent experiments were performed under the same TAO concentrations and exposure times, avoiding the direct tumoricidal effect of TAO, which was confirmed with apoptosis markers. An invasion assay revealed a dose-dependent decrease in invasiveness under the influence of TAO. Both the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines, which was in accordance with the invasion assay results. The TAO decreased kinase activity of Akt on GSK-3Î² assay and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines regardless of their PTEN status. Conclusions: These results showed that TAO effectively inhibits proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines and also exerts an anti-invasive effect via decreased MMP-2 secretion, decreased MT1-MMP expression, and the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation under conditions devoid of cytotoxicity. Further investigations using an in vivo model are needed to evaluate the potential role of TAO as an anti-invasive agent.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25303017

In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that ITGA7 plays a key functional role in growth and invasiveness of GSCs. We also found that targeting of ITGA7 by RNAi or blocking mAbs impaired laminin-induced signaling, and it led to a significant delay in tumor engraftment plus a strong reduction in tumor size and invasion.

Surprisingly however, Rac1 depletion has a much smaller inhibitory effect on SNB19 cell proliferation and survival. Interestingly, whereas depletion of Rac3 strongly inhibits SNB19 cell invasion, it does not affect lamellipodia formation and has only minor effects on cell migration and proliferation.

"""Exploiting Microglial Functions for the Treatment of Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain tumor in adults and is associated with a very low survival rate. The heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, its resistance to drug and radiation therapy, and its robust invasiveness all contribute to the poor outcome. Large numbers of glioma associated microglia and macrophages (GAMs) can accumulate within the tumor where they appear to have an important role in prognosis. Methods: An extensive revision of current available literature on this topic has been carried out, using the PubMed database. Articles exploring the contribution of GAMs to GBM biology as well as evidence that GAMs can be pharmacologically modulated to inhibit tumor growth are critically discussed in this review article. Results: GAMs constitute the largest portion of tumor infiltrating cells contributing up to 30% of the entire glioma mass. Upon interaction with neoplastic cells, GAMs acquire a unique phenotype of activation including both M1 and M2 specific markers. Different profiles of activation usually co-exist in the same tumor that is dependent upon GAM location or stage of disease. In addition to regulating immune responses which may control or favor astrocyte malignant transformation, GAMs are directly involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a crucial mechanism that allows the expansion of tumors and parenchyma invasion. Several pharmacological strategies have been developed which interfere with GAM recruitment at the tumor site, cell polarization and immune function, and ECM remodeling by GAM-secreted factors. The most promising therapeutic approaches appear to target both GBM cells and GAM biological properties. Conclusion: GAMs significantly contribute to GBM biology (favoring tumor growth and invasiveness).

We found that the amount of vascular mimicry (VM) significantly increased 6 days after BEV treatment. TMZ inhibited neovascularization at an early stage, but the microvessel density (MVD) and transfer coefficient (Ktrans) derived from DCE-MRI increased 6 days after treatment. TMZ and BEV combination therapy slightly prolonged the inhibitory effect on tumor microvessels. Sprouting angiogenesis was positively correlated with Ktrans in all treatment groups. The increase in VM after BEV administration and the increase in MVD and Ktrans after TMZ administration may be responsible for treatment resistance.

The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database was used to perform a proteinâprotein interaction (PPI) analysis. A Venn diagram was used to obtain the core target genes of YQQYJDF for GBM treatment. Molecular docking was used to verify the binding between the active ingredient molecules and the proteins corresponding to the core target genes. Cell proliferation assays and invasion assays were used to verify the effect of active ingredients on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Results: A total of 73 potential targets of YQQYJDF in the treatment of GBM were obtained. Enrichment analyses showed that the biological processes and molecular functions involved in these target genes were related to the activation of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway and the regulation of hypoxia. The neuroactive ligandâreceptor pathway, the cellular senescence pathway, the calcium signaling pathway, the cell cycle pathway and the p53 signaling pathway might play important roles. Combining the results of WGCNA and PPI analysis, five core target genes and their corresponding four core active ingredients were screened. Molecular docking indicated that the core active ingredient molecules and the proteins corresponding to the core target genes had strong binding affinities. Cell proliferation and invasion assays showed that the core active ingredients of YQQYJDF significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The present study predicted the possible active ingredients and targets of YQQYJDF in treating GBM, and analyzed its possible mechanism. These results may provide a basis and ideas for further research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37759283
"""MAP-2e, a novel MAP-2 isoform, is expressed in gliomas and delineates tumor architecture and patterns of infiltration.""","""The MAP-2 isoform containing exon 13 (MAP-2e) is expressed in human fetal development as early as 15 gestational weeks and parallels oligodendrocyte maturation. MAP-2e is down-regulated following myelination and is expressed in few cells in the adult central nervous system (CNS). To determine whether CNS tumors express MAP-2e, we screened 122 archival, paraffin-embedded adult and pediatric tumors of the CNS and non-CNS. All oligodendrogliomas were positive and extensive staining was observed in glioblastomas, various malignant gliomas and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors. MAP-2e was not expressed in non-CNS tumors or neuroblastomas. Thus. neuroectodermal tumors that have glial characteristics express this developmental marker of immature glia. Analysis of oligodendrogliomas demonstrated numerous cell morphologies from round cells with no processes to cells with single or multiple processes. MAP-2e immunostaining also delineated tumor invasion into adjacent gray and white matter, indicating that MAP-2e appears to be a useful marker for examining the infiltration of malignant cells into surrounding tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12025943
"""NHERF-1: modulator of glioblastoma cell migration and invasion.""","""The invasive nature of malignant gliomas is a clinical problem rendering tumors incurable by conventional treatment modalities such as surgery, ionizing radiation, and temozolomide. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1) is a multifunctional adaptor protein, recruiting cytoplasmic signaling proteins and membrane receptors/transporters into functional complexes. This study revealed that NHERF-1 expression is increased in highly invasive cells that reside in the rim of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors and that NHERF-1 sustains glioma migration and invasion. Gene expression profiles were evaluated from laser capture-microdissected human GBM cells isolated from patient tumor cores and corresponding invaded white matter regions. The role of NHERF-1 in the migration and dispersion of GBM cell lines was examined by reducing its expression with small-interfering RNA followed by radial migration, three-dimensional collagen dispersion, immunofluorescence, and survival assays. The in situ expression of NHERF-1 protein was restricted to glioma cells and the vascular endothelium, with minimal to no detection in adjacent normal brain tissue. Depletion of NHERF-1 arrested migration and dispersion of glioma cell lines and caused an increase in cell-cell cohesiveness. Glioblastoma multiforme cells with depleted NHERF-1 evidenced a marked decrease in stress fibers, a larger cell size, and a more rounded shape with fewer cellular processes. When NHERF-1 expression was reduced, glioma cells became sensitized to temozolomide treatment resulting in increased apoptosis. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence for NHERF-1 as a participant in the highly invasive phenotype of malignant gliomas and implicate NHERF-1 as a possible therapeutic target for treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19308292
"""Predicting MGMT methylation status of glioblastomas from MRI texture.""","""In glioblastoma (GBM), promoter methylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT is associated with benefit from chemotherapy. Because MGMT promoter methylation status can not be determined in all cases, a surrogate for the methylation status would be a useful clinical tool. Correlation between methylation status and magnetic resonance imaging features has been reported suggesting that non-invasive MGMT promoter methylation status detection is possible. In this work, a retrospective analysis of T2, FLAIR and T1-post contrast MR images in patients with newly diagnosed GBM is performed using L1-regularized neural networks. Tumor texture, assessed quantitatively was utilized for predicting the MGMT promoter methylation status of a GBM in 59 patients. The texture features were extracted using a space-frequency texture analysis based on the S-transform and utilized by a neural network to predict the methylation status of a GBM. Blinded classification of MGMT promoter methylation status reached an average accuracy of 87.7%, indicating that the proposed technique is accurate enough for clinical use.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20426152
"""Deltex-1 activates mitotic signaling and proliferation and increases the clonogenic and invasive potential of U373 and LN18 glioblastoma cells and correlates with patient survival.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system originating in glial cells. GBM results in more years of life lost than any other cancer type. Low levels of Notch receptor expression correlates with prolonged survival in various high grade gliomas independent of other markers. Different downstream pathways of Notch receptors have been identified. We tested if the Notch/Deltex pathway, which is distinct from the canonical, CSL-mediated pathway, has a role in GBM. We show that the alternative or non-canonical Notch pathway functioning through Deltex1 (DTX1) mediates key features of glioblastoma cell aggressiveness. For example, DTX1 activates the RTK/PI3K/PKB and the MAPK/ERK mitotic pathways and induces anti-apoptotic Mcl-1. The clonogenic and growth potential of established glioma cells correlated with DTX1 levels. Microarray gene expression analysis further identified a DTX1-specific, MAML1-independent transcriptional program - including microRNA-21- which is functionally linked to the changes in tumor cell aggressiveness. Over-expression of DTX1 increased cell migration and invasion correlating to ERK activation, miR-21 levels and endogenous Notch levels. In contrast to high and intermediate expressors, patients with low DTX1 levels have a more favorable prognosis. The alternative Notch pathway via DTX1 appears to be an oncogenic factor in glioblastoma and these findings offer new potential therapeutic targets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23451269
"""TWIST1 promotes invasion through mesenchymal change in human glioblastoma.""","""Background: Tumor cell invasion into adjacent normal brain is a mesenchymal feature of GBM and a major factor contributing to their dismal outcomes. Therefore, better understandings of mechanisms that promote mesenchymal change in GBM are of great clinical importance to address invasion. We previously showed that the bHLH transcription factor TWIST1 which orchestrates carcinoma metastasis through an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is upregulated in GBM and promotes invasion of the SF767 GBM cell line in vitro. Results: To further define TWIST1 functions in GBM we tested the impact of TWIST1 over-expression on invasion in vivo and its impact on gene expression. We found that TWIST1 significantly increased SNB19 and T98G cell line invasion in orthotopic xenotransplants and increased expression of genes in functional categories associated with adhesion, extracellular matrix proteins, cell motility and locomotion, cell migration and actin cytoskeleton organization. Consistent with this TWIST1 reduced cell aggregation, promoted actin cytoskeletal re-organization and enhanced migration and adhesion to fibronectin substrates. Individual genes upregulated by TWIST1 known to promote EMT and/or GBM invasion included SNAI2, MMP2, HGF, FAP and FN1. Distinct from carcinoma EMT, TWIST1 did not generate an E- to N-cadherin 'switch' in GBM cell lines. The clinical relevance of putative TWIST target genes SNAI2 and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) identified in vitro was confirmed by their highly correlated expression with TWIST1 in 39 human tumors. The potential therapeutic importance of inhibiting TWIST1 was also shown through a decrease in cell invasion in vitro and growth of GBM stem cells. Conclusions: Together these studies demonstrated that TWIST1 enhances GBM invasion in concert with mesenchymal change not involving the canonical cadherin switch of carcinoma EMT. Given the recent recognition that mesenchymal change in GBMs is associated with increased malignancy, these findings support the potential therapeutic importance of strategies to subvert TWIST1-mediated mesenchymal change.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20646316
"""Intrinsic and Microenvironmental Drivers of Glioblastoma Invasion.""","""Gliomas are diffusely infiltrating brain tumors whose prognosis is strongly influenced by their extent of invasion into the surrounding brain tissue. While lower-grade gliomas present more circumscribed borders, high-grade gliomas are aggressive tumors with widespread brain infiltration and dissemination. Glioblastoma (GBM) is known for its high invasiveness and association with poor prognosis. Its low survival rate is due to the certainty of its recurrence, caused by microscopic brain infiltration which makes surgical eradication unattainable. New insights into GBM biology at the single-cell level have enabled the identification of mechanisms exploited by glioma cells for brain invasion. In this review, we explore the current understanding of several molecular pathways and mechanisms used by tumor cells to invade normal brain tissue. We address the intrinsic biological drivers of tumor cell invasion, by tackling how tumor cells interact with each other and with the tumor microenvironment (TME). We focus on the recently discovered neuronal niche in the TME, including local as well as distant neurons, contributing to glioma growth and invasion. We then address the mechanisms of invasion promoted by astrocytes and immune cells. Finally, we review the current literature on the therapeutic targeting of the molecular mechanisms of invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38473812

However, the potential mechanisms of LINC01207 in malignant glioma are still unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to analyze LINC01207 mRNA levels in malignant glioma cell lines and tissue samples. The correlation between LINC01207 mRNA levels and clinical characteristics was explored, and the relative survival rate was observed using the Kaplan-Meier method. To examine the function of LINC01207, we performed cell viability, EdU assay, cell cycle assay, Transwell assay, and wound-healing assay to analyze relative cell proliferation, migration/invasion ability. Finally, qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanisms. RESULTS LINC01207 mRNA was lowly expressed in malignant glioma cells and cancer tissue samples. Low expression of LINC01207 was associated with Karnofsky performance score (KPS), invasion condition, and tumor grade. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed LINC01207 expression and tumor grade were significant independent predictors of poor survival in malignant glioma. LINC01207 markedly inhibited cellar proliferation and viability via inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrested and repressed cell metastasis through restraining epithelial-to-mesenchymal procession in vivo. In addition, we detected a reduction in the protein levels of Ã-catenin and p-GSK-3Ã, while GSK-3Ã expression was upregulated. CONCLUSIONS In summary, LINC01207 served as a tumor-related tumor suppress gene for malignant glioma through inhibiting of GSK-3Ã/Ã-catenin signaling pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533688
"""NEDD9 regulates 3D migratory activity independent of the Rac1 morphology switch in glioma and neuroblastoma.""","""Metastasizing tumor cells must transmigrate the dense extracellular matrix that surrounds most organs. The use of three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels has revealed that many cancer cells can switch between different modes of invasion that are characterized by distinct morphologies (e.g., rounded vs. elongated). The adhesion protein NEDD9 has the potential to regulate the switch between elongated and rounded morphologies; therefore, its role was interrogated in the invasion switch of glioblastoma and neuroblastoma tumors that similarly derive from populations of neural crest cells. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of NEDD9 failed to induce cell rounding in glioma or neuroblastoma cells, contrasting the effects that have been described in other tumor model systems. Given that Rac1 GTPase has been suggested to mediate the switch between elongated and rounded invasion, the functionality of the Rac1 morphology switch was evaluated in the glioma and neuroblastoma cells. Using both dominant-negative Rac1 and Rac1-specific siRNA, the presence of this morphologic switch was confirmed in the neuroblastoma, but not in the glioma cells. However, in the absence of a morphologic change following NEDD9 depletion, a significant decrease in the cellular migration rate was observed. Thus, the data reveal that NEDD9 can regulate 3D migration speed independent of the Rac1 morphology switch. Implications: NEDD9 targeting is therapeutically viable as it does not stimulate adaptive changes in glioma and neuroblastoma invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24337070
"""Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and associated upstream and downstream proteins in the pathophysiology and management of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an exceptionally poor patient outcome despite aggressive therapy including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. This aggressive phenotype may be associated with intratumoral hypoxia, which probably plays a key role in GBM tumor growth, development, and angiogenesis. A key regulator of cellular response to hypoxia is the protein hypoxia-inducible factorâ1 (HIF-1). An examination of upstream hypoxic and nonhypoxic regulation of HIF-1 as well as a review of the downstream HIF-1â regulated proteins may provide further insight into the role of this transcription factor in GBM pathophysiology. Recent insights into upstream regulators that intimately interact with HIF-1 could provide potential therapeutic targets for treatment of this tumor. The same is potentially true for HIF-1âmediated pathways of glycolysis-, angiogenesis-, and invasion-promoting proteins.

"""Impedance-based Real-time Measurement of Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.""","""Cancer arises due to uncontrolled proliferation of cells initiated by genetic instability, mutations, and environmental and other stress factors. These acquired abnormalities in complex, multilayered molecular signaling networks induce aberrant cell proliferation and survival, extracellular matrix degradation, and metastasis to distant organs. Approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths are estimated to be caused by the direct or indirect effects of metastatic dissemination. Therefore, it is important to establish a highly reliable, comprehensive system to characterize cancer cell behaviors upon genetic and environmental manipulations. Such a system can give a clear understanding of the molecular regulation of cancer metastasis and the opportunity for successful development of stratified, precise therapeutic strategies. Hence, accurate determination of cancer cell behaviors such as migration and invasion with gain or loss of function of gene(s) allows assessment of the aggressive nature of cancer cells. The real-time measurement system based on cell impedance enables researchers to continually acquire data during a whole experiment and instantly compare and quantify the results under various experimental conditions.

"""Neural stem cells display extensive tropism for pathology in adult brain: evidence from intracranial gliomas.""","""One of the impediments to the treatment of brain tumors (e.g., gliomas) has been the degree to which they expand, infiltrate surrounding tissue, and migrate widely into normal brain, usually rendering them 'elusive' to effective resection, irradiation, chemotherapy, or gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs), when implanted into experimental intracranial gliomas in vivo in adult rodents, distribute themselves quickly and extensively throughout the tumor bed and migrate uniquely in juxtaposition to widely expanding and aggressively advancing tumor cells, while continuing to stably express a foreign gene. The NSCs 'surround' the invading tumor border while 'chasing down' infiltrating tumor cells. When implanted intracranially at distant sites from the tumor (e.g., into normal tissue, into the contralateral hemisphere, or into the cerebral ventricles), the donor cells migrate through normal tissue targeting the tumor cells (including human glioblastomas). When implanted outside the CNS intravascularly, NSCs will target an intracranial tumor. NSCs can deliver a therapeutically relevant molecule-cytosine deaminase-such that quantifiable reduction in tumor burden results. These data suggest the adjunctive use of inherently migratory NSCs as a delivery vehicle for targeting therapeutic genes and vectors to refractory, migratory, invasive brain tumors. More broadly, they suggest that NSC migration can be extensive, even in the adult brain and along nonstereotypical routes, if pathology (as modeled here by tumor) is present.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11070094
"""Betulinic Acid for Glioblastoma Treatment: Reality, Challenges and Perspectives.""","""Betulinic acid is a naturally occurring compound that can be obtained through methanolic or ethanolic extraction from plant sources, as well as through chemical synthesis or microbial biotransformation. Betulinic acid has been investigated for its potential therapeutic properties, and exhibits anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimalarial, and antioxidant activities. Notably, its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier addresses a significant challenge in treating neurological pathologies. This review aims to compile information about the impact of betulinic acid as an antitumor agent, particularly in the context of glioblastoma. Importantly, betulinic acid demonstrates selective antitumor activity against glioblastoma cells by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, consistent with observations in other cancer types. Compelling evidence published highlights the acid's therapeutic action in suppressing the Akt/NFÎºB-p65 signaling cascade and enhancing the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. Interesting findings with betulinic acid also suggest a focus on researching the reduction of glioblastoma's invasiveness and aggressiveness profile. This involves modulation of extracellular matrix components, remodeling of the cytoskeleton, and secretion of proteolytic proteins.

"""SRC regulates actin dynamics and invasion of malignant glial cells in three dimensions.""","""Malignant glioma is the major brain tumor in adults and has a poor prognosis. The failure to control invasive cell subpopulations may be the key reason for local glioma recurrence after radical tumor resection and may contribute substantially to the failure of the other treatment modalities such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy. As a model for this invasion, we have implanted spheroids from a human glioma cell line (U251) in three-dimensional collagen type I matrices, which these cells readily invade. We first observed that the Src family kinase-specific pharmacologic inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 significantly inhibited the invasion of the cells in this assay. We confirmed this result by showing that expression of two inhibitors of Src family function, dominant-negative-Src and CSK, also suppressed glioma cell invasion. To characterize this effect at the level of the cytoskeleton, we used fluorescent time-lapse microscopy on U251 cells stably expressing a YFP-actin construct and observed a rapid change in actin dynamics following addition of PP2 in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures. In monolayer cultures, PP2 caused the disappearance of peripheral membrane ruffles within minutes. In three-dimensional cultures, PP2 induced the loss of actin bursting at the leading tip of the invadopodium. The inhibition of Src family activity is thus a potential therapeutic approach to treat highly invasive malignant glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15561776

Independent cohorts of non-G-CIMP GBMs or IDH wild type (wt) lower-grade gliomas (LGGs) from local and public databases with DNA methylation and gene expression microarray data were included for discovery and validation of a multimarker signature, combined using a RISK score model. Bioinformatic and in vitro functional analyses were employed for biological validation. Using a strict multistep selection approach, we identified eight CpGs, each of which was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) of non-G-CIMP GBMs, independent of age, the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, treatments and other identified CpGs. An epigenetic RISK signature of the 8 CpGs was developed and validated to robustly and independently prognosticate prognosis in different cohorts of not only non-G-GIMP GBMs, but also IDHwt LGGs. It also showed good discriminating value in stratified cohorts by current clinical and molecular factors. Bioinformatic analysis revealed consistent correlation of the epigenetic signature to distinct immune-relevant transcriptional profiles of GBM bulks. Functional experiments showed that S100A2 appeared to be epigenetically regulated by one identified CpG and was associated with GBM cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and immunosuppression. The prognostic 8-CpGs RISK score signature may be of promising value for refining current glioma risk classification, and its potential links to distinct immune phenotypes make it a promising biomarker candidate for predicting response to anti-glioma immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854822

Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) is necessary for tumour progression, NF-ÎºB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease. Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide, a NF-ÎºB inhibitor, in two human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG and U373) and in glioblastoma xenografts. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. Methods: The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays. Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) assay. In addition, the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model. Results: We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation, invasion, and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells. Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors. Furthermore, parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling, suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-ÎºB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins. Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts.

Without treatment the mean patient survival is approximately 6 months, which can be extended to 15 months with the use of multimodal therapies. The low effectiveness of GBM therapies is mainly due to the tumor infiltration into the healthy brain tissue, which depends on GBM cells' interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME). The interaction of GBM cells with the TME involves cellular components such as stem-like cells, glia, endothelial cells, and non-cellular components such as the extracellular matrix, enhanced hypoxia, and soluble factors such as adenosine, which promote GBM's invasiveness. However, here we highlight the role of 3D patient-derived glioblastoma organoids cultures as a new platform for study of the modeling of TME and invasiveness.

"""Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cell Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Glioblastoma Proliferation, Invasiveness and Angiogenesis.""","""Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are attractive anticancer drug delivery candidates as they confer several fundamental properties, such as low immunogenicity and the ability to cross biological barriers. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are convenient producers for high EV yields, and patient-derived adipose tissue MSC-EVs could serve as personalised carriers. However, MSC-EV applications raise critical concerns as their natural cargo can affect tumour progression in both inducing and suppressing ways. In this study, we investigated the effect of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell EVs (ASC-EVs) on several glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines to define their applicability for anticancer therapies. ASC-EVs were isolated from a cell-conditioned medium and characterised by size and specific markers. The internalisation of fluorescently labelled ASC-EVs by human GBM cells HROG36, U87 MG, and T98G was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. Changes in GBM cell proliferation after ASC-EV application were determined by the metabolic PrestoBlue assay. Expression alterations in genes responsible for cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. ASC-EV effects on tumour invasiveness and neoangiogenesis in ovo were analysed on the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM). ASC-EV treatment reduced GBM proliferation in vitro and significantly downregulated invasiveness-related genes ITGÎ±5 (in T98G and HROG63) and ITGÎ²3 (in HROG36) and the vascularisation-inducing gene KDR (in all GBM lines). Additionally, an approximate 65% reduction in the GBM invasion rate was observed in CAM after ASC-EV treatment.

It has been concerned whether general anesthetics, especially volatile anesthetics, may promote the growth, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effects of sevoflurane on human glioblastoma cells and determined the role of cluster of differentiation (CD) 44, a cell surface protein involved in cell growth, migration, and invasion, in sevoflurane's effects. We showed that exposure to 1%-4% sevoflurane did not change the cell proliferation, but concentration-dependently increased the invasion of human glioblastoma U251 cells. Furthermore, 4% sevoflurane significantly increased the migration and colony-forming ability of U251 cells. Similar results were observed in human glioblastoma A172 cells. Exposure to sevoflurane concentration-dependently increased the activity of calpains, a group of cysteine proteinases, and CD44 protein in U251 and A172 cells. Knockdown of CD44 with siRNA abolished sevoflurane-induced increases in calpain activity, migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of U251 cells. Inhalation of 4% sevoflurane significantly increased the tumor volume and invasion/migration distance of U87 cells from the tumor mass in the nude mice bearing human glioblastoma U87 xenograft in the brain. The aggravation by sevoflurane was attenuated by CD44 silencing. In conclusion, sevoflurane increases the migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of human glioblastoma cells in vitro, and their tumor volume and invasion/migration in vivo. Sevoflurane enhances these cancer cell biology features via increasing the expression of CD44.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30967592

Notably, TAAs also influence GBM cell behaviors via suppressing immune responses and enhancing the chemoradiotherapy resistance of tumor cells. These new activities are closely linked with the treatment and prognosis of GBM. In this review, we discuss recent advances regarding new functions of reactive astrocytes, including TAA-cancer cell interactions, mechanisms involved in immunosuppressive regulation, and chemoradiotherapy resistance.

In this study, we established the spatiotemporal and regional contributions of perivascular BMDCs (pBMDC) to GBM development. We found an increased recruitment of BMDCs to GBM in response to tumor growth and following radiotherapy. However, in this study, BMDCs did not differentiate into endothelial cells directly but rather provided a perivascular support role. The pBMDCs were shown to associate with tumor vasculature in a highly region-dependent manner, with central vasculature requiring minimal pBMDC support. Region-dependent association of pBMDC was regulated by VEGF. In the absence of VEGF, following radiotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy, we documented an increase in Ang2 that regulated recruitment of pBMDCs to maintain the vulnerable central vasculature.

PIKE-A, a proto-oncogene that is one of the important components of the CDK4 amplicon, binds to and enhances the kinase activity of Akt, thereby promoting cancer progression. To define the roles of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in glioblastoma multiform (GBM) progression, we used biochemical protein/protein interaction (PPI) assays and live cell fluorescence-based protein complementation assays to search for small peptide antagonist from these proteins that were able to block their interaction. Here, we show that disruption of the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt by the small peptides significantly reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Disruption of PIKE-A/Akt association potently suppressed GBM cell proliferation and sensitized the cells to two clinical drugs that are currently used to treat GBM. Interestingly, GBM cells containing the CDK4 amplicon were more responsive to the inhibition of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction than GBM cells lacking this amplicon. Taken together, our findings provide proof-of-principle that blocking a PPI that is essential for cancer progression provides a valuable strategy for therapeutic discovery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22450747

Noteworthy, melanoma brain metastases (MM-BM), that share the same niche as GBM, frequently respond to current ICI therapies. Epigenetic modifications regulate GBM cellular proliferation, invasion, and prognosis and may negatively regulate the cross-talk between malignant cells and immune cells in the tumor milieu, likely contributing to limit the efficacy of ICI therapy of GBM. Thus, manipulating the tumor epigenome can be considered a therapeutic opportunity in GBM. Methods: Microarray transcriptional and methylation profiles, followed by gene set enrichment and IPA analyses, were performed to study the differences in the constitutive expression profiles of GBM vs MM-BM cells, compared to the extracranial MM cells and to investigate the modulatory effects of the DNA hypomethylating agent (DHA) guadecitabine among the different tumor cells. The prognostic relevance of DHA-modulated genes was tested by Cox analysis in a TCGA GBM patients' cohort. Results: The most striking differences between GBM and MM-BM cells were found to be the enrichment of biological processes associated with tumor growth, invasion, and extravasation with the inhibition of MHC class II antigen processing/presentation in GBM cells. Treatment with guadecitabine reduced these biological differences, shaping GBM cells towards a more immunogenic phenotype. Indeed, in GBM cells, promoter hypomethylation by guadecitabine led to the up-regulation of genes mainly associated with activation, proliferation, and migration of T and B cells and with MHC class II antigen processing/presentation. Among DHA-modulated genes in GBM, 7.6% showed a significant prognostic relevance. Moreover, a large set of immune-related upstream-regulators (URs) were commonly modulated by DHA in GBM, MM-BM, and MM cells: DHA-activated URs enriched for biological processes mainly involved in the regulation of cytokines and chemokines production, inflammatory response, and in Type I/II/III IFN-mediated signaling; conversely, DHA-inhibited URs were involved in metabolic and proliferative pathways. Conclusions: Epigenetic remodeling by guadecitabine represents a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy of GBM, supporting the rationale to develop new epigenetic-based immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of this still highly deadly disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38429759
"""Interleukin-1 regulates the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 in glioblastoma cells.""","""Chronic inflammation and inflammatory cytokines have recently been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer. In the brain, neuroinflammatory cytokines affect the growth and differentiation of both normal and malignant glial cells, with interleukin 1 (IL-1) shown to be secreted by the majority of glioblastoma cells. Recently, elevated levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), but not SphK2, were correlated with a shorter survival prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiforme. SphK1 is a lipid kinase that produces the pro-growth, anti-apoptotic sphingosine 1-phosphate, which can induce invasion of glioblastoma cells. Here, we show that the expression of IL-1 correlates with the expression of SphK1 in glioblastoma cells, and neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibit both the growth and invasion of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, IL-1 up-regulates SphK1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and activity in both primary human astrocytes and various glioblastoma cell lines; however, it does not affect SphK2 expression. The IL-1-induced SphK1 up-regulation can be blocked by the inhibition of JNK, the overexpression of the dominant-negative c-Jun(TAM67), and the down-regulation of c-Jun expression by small interference RNA. Activation of SphK1 expression by IL-1 occurs on the level of transcription and is mediated via a novel AP-1 element located within the first intron of the sphk1 gene. In summary, our results suggest that SphK1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by IL-1 in glioblastoma cells, and this pathway may be important in regulating survival and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19074142

"""Annexin A2-STAT3-Oncostatin M receptor axis drives phenotypic and mesenchymal changes in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by extensive tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, and proliferation. We previously established subclones of GBM cells with distinct invasive phenotypes and identified annexin A2 (ANXA2) as an activator of angiogenesis and perivascular invasion. Here, we further explored the role of ANXA2 in regulating phenotypic transition in GBM. We identified oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) as a key ANXA2 target gene in GBM utilizing microarray analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis of the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Overexpression of ANXA2 in GBM cells increased the expression of OSMR and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and enhanced cell invasion, angiogenesis, proliferation, and mesenchymal transition. Silencing of OSMR reversed the ANXA2-induced phenotype, and STAT3 knockdown reduced OSMR protein expression. Exposure of GBM cells to hypoxic conditions activated the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR signaling axis. Mice bearing ANXA2-overexpressing GBM exhibited shorter survival times compared with control tumor-bearing mice, whereas OSMR knockdown increased the survival time and diminished ANXA2-mediated tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and growth. Further, we uncovered a significant relationship between ANXA2 and OSMR expression in clinical GBM specimens, and demonstrated their correlation with tumor histopathology and patient prognosis. Our results indicate that the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR axis regulates malignant phenotypic changes and mesenchymal transition in GBM, suggesting that this axis is a promising therapeutic target to treat GBM aggressiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32248843
"""Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) activates Src protein and is a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma.""","""Despite recent advances in molecular classification, surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies, the clinical outcome of patients with malignant brain tumors remains extremely poor. In this study, we have identified the tetraspan protein epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) as a potential target for glioblastoma (GBM) killing. EMP2 had low or undetectable expression in normal brain but was highly expressed in GBM as 95% of patients showed some expression of the protein. In GBM cells, EMP2 enhanced tumor growth in vivo in part by up-regulating Î±vÎ²3 integrin surface expression, activating focal adhesion kinase and Src kinases, and promoting cell migration and invasion. Consistent with these findings, EMP2 expression significantly correlated with activated Src kinase in patient samples and promoted tumor cell invasion using intracranial mouse models. As a proof of principle to determine whether EMP2 could serve as a target for therapy, cells were treated using specific anti-EMP2 antibody reagents. These reagents were effective in killing GBM cells in vitro and in reducing tumor load in subcutaneous mouse models. These results support the role of EMP2 in the pathogenesis of GBM and suggest that anti-EMP2 treatment may be a novel therapeutic treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24644285
"""Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III-induced glioma invasion is mediated through myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate overexpression.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most malignant adult brain tumor. A characteristic of GBM is their highly invasive nature, making complete surgical resection impossible. The most common gain-of-function alteration in GBM is amplification, overexpression, and mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The constitutively activated mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), found in approximately 20% of GBM, confers proliferative and invasive advantage. The signaling cascades downstream of aberrant EGFR activation contributing to the invasive phenotype are not completely understood. Here, we show myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), previously implicated in cell adhesion and motility, contributes to EGFR-mediated invasion of human GBM cells. EGFRvIII-expressing or EGF-stimulated human GBM cells increased expression, phosphorylation, and cytosolic translocation of MARCKS in a protein kinase C-alpha-dependent manner. Down-regulation of MARCKS expression with small interfering RNA in GBM cells expressing EGFRvIII led to decreased cell adhesion, spreading, and invasion.

"""CXCL12 impact on glioblastoma cells behaviors under dynamic culture conditions: Insights for developing new therapeutic approaches.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor, with an average survival time of 14 to 20 months. Its capacity to invade brain parenchyma leads to the failure of conventional treatments and subsequent tumor recurrence. Recent studies have explored new therapeutic strategies using a chemoattracting gradient to attract GBM cells into a soft hydrogel trap where they can be exposed to higher doses of radiation or chemotherapy. It has been demonstrated in vitro under static conditions, that nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the chemoattractant CXCL12 can create a gradient to attract GBM cell. However, GBM cell invasion is also largely dependent on interstitial fluid flow (IFF). In the present study, a custom-made in vitro 3D model with indirect perfusion to mimic IFF at flow rates of 0.5 Î¼L/min and 3 Î¼L/min was used to examine the invasive behavior of F98-rodent-derived and U87-human-derived GBM cells. This model simulated IFF and CXCL12 gradient within an alginate:matrigel-based hydrogel mimicking brain parenchyma. Findings revealed that CXCL12 (1600 ng/mL) released from NPs significantly increased the migration of F98 GBM cells after 72 hours under IFF conditions at both 0.5 and 3 Î¼L/min. In contrast, U87 GBM cells required a higher CXCL12 concentration (2400 ng/mL) and longer incubation time for migration (120 hours). Unlike the F98 cells, U87 GBM cells showed a CXCL12 dose-dependent proliferation. Semi-quantitative qPCR showed higher CXCR4 mRNA levels in F98 cells than in U87 cells. CXCL12 significantly increased intracellular calcium levels via CXCR4 activation, with a 2.3-fold rise in F98 cells compared to U87, consistent with observed cell behavior during perfusion. This highlights the combined influence of IFF and CXCL12 on cell migration, dependent on cell line. This 3D dynamic model is a valuable tool to analyze parameters like interstitial fluid flow (IFF) and chemokine gradients, influenced by GBM tumor diversity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39715221
"""Incorporation of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data into a simple mathematical model of tumor growth.""","""We build on previous work to show how serial diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data can be used to estimate proliferation rates in a rat model of brain cancer. Thirteen rats were inoculated intracranially with 9L tumor cells; eight rats were treated with the chemotherapeutic drug 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and five rats were untreated controls. All animals underwent DW-MRI immediately before, one day and three days after treatment. Values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated from the DW-MRI data and then used to estimate the number of cells in each voxel and also for whole tumor regions of interest. The data from the first two imaging time points were then used to estimate the proliferation rate of each tumor. The proliferation rates were used to predict the number of tumor cells at day three, and this was correlated with the corresponding experimental data. The voxel-by-voxel analysis yielded Pearsonâs correlation coefficients ranging from â0.06 to 0.65, whereas the region of interest analysis provided Pearsonâs and concordance correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.80, respectively. Additionally, the ratio of positive to negative proliferation values was used to separate the treated and control animals (p <0.05) at an earlier point than the mean ADC values. These results further illustrate how quantitative measurements of tumor state obtained non-invasively by imaging can be incorporated into mathematical models that predict tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22156038
"""An immunohistochemical study of extracellular matrix proteins laminin, fibronectin and type IV collagen in paediatric glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Aims: In the recent decades many studies have been addressed in the literature to assess specific factors related to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) invasion. However, few studies have evaluated tumour cell's interaction with specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and, moreover, there is a lack of information regarding the occurrence of these phenomena in paediatric GBM. Methods and results: ECM proteins were evaluated in six cases of paediatric GBM assessing the immunohistochemical expression of laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen. We used a semiquantitative scale, ranging from not detected (zero) to marked (3). Laminin expression was minimal in three cases, moderate in one case, marked and generalised in one patient and marked and focal in the last case. Fibronectin expression was minimal in three patients; moderate immunoreactivity was documented in one case. Conversely, one case was classified as marked with generalised distribution and the remaining case as marked with focal immunostaining. Type IV collagen expression was minimal in three cases, moderate in one, marked with focal reaction in one and marked with generalised reaction in the remaining case. Conclusions: This study provides additional insights into tumour invasion features of paediatric GBM, as ECM plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular functions during normal and pathological processes. Although based on a limited number of patients, this investigation may serve as a challenge for the management of paediatric GBM, stimulating trials with larger patient numbers aimed at documenting specific factors influencing GBM prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15309586
"""The motility of glioblastoma tumour cells is modulated by intracellular cofilin expression in a concentration-dependent manner.""","""The invasive behaviour of tumour cells has been attributed in part to dysregulated cell motility. Members of the ADF/Cofilin family of actin-binding proteins are known to increase microfilament dynamics by increasing the rate at which actin monomers leave the pointed end of the filament and by a filament-severing activity. As depolymerisation is a rate-limiting step in actin dynamics, ADF/Cofilins are suspected to facilitate the motility of cells. To test this, we investigated the influence of cofilin on tumour motility by transient and stably overexpressing cofilin in the human glioblastoma cell line, U373 MG. Several different methods were used to ascertain the level of cofilin in overexpressing clones and this was correlated with their rate of random locomotion. A biphasic relationship between cofilin level and locomotory rate was found. Clones that displayed a moderate amount of overproduction of cofilin were found to have increased rates of locomotion approximately linear to the overproduction of cofilin up to an optimal cofilin level of about 4.5 times that of wild type cells at which the cells were almost twice as fast. However, clones producing more than this optimal amount were found to locomote at progressively reduced speeds. Cells that overexpress cofilin have reduced stress fibres compared to control cells showing that the excess cofilin affects the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that overexpression of cofilin enhances the motility of glioblastoma tumour cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, which is likely to contribute to their invasiveness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15662725

Methods: A total of 22 tumour samples comprising 11 meningiomas and 11 glioblastomas with adjacent peritumoural tissue were analysed. Results: The mean tPA content of meningiomas was approximately half that of glioblastomas (55.40 (S.D. 34.58) versus 106.98 (S.D. 43.82) ng/ml, p=0.006). Comparing tPA quantity in tumour and peritumoural tissue, there was a significant difference for meningiomas (55.40 (S.D. 34.58) versus 28.35 (S.D. 22.55) ng/ml, p=0.05), but no difference for glioblastomas (106.98 (S.D. 43.82) versus 84.23 (S.D. 57.39) ng/ml, p=0.32). Comparing tumour with normal brain tissue, there was no difference for meningiomas (55.40 (S.D. 34.58) versus 33.08 (S.D. 21.55) ng/ml, p=0.22), but a significant difference for glioblastomas (106.98 (S.D. 43.82) versus 33.08 (S.D. 21.55) ng/ml, p=0.004). Western blotting showed that in the meningioma group, the molecular weight pattern was constant with a dominant well-defined band at 41kD. Peritumoural tissue demonstrated two bands, with the stronger band at 41kD and a slightly weaker band at 71kD. In the glioblastoma group, there was more heterogeneity, with a dominant 41kD band found in all tumour and peritumoural samples, together with additional bands at 34, 58 and 66kD. Conclusion: These results indicate that (1) tPA is present in larger quantities in glioblastoma compared to meningioma and normal brain, (2) tPA quantity is not significantly different in the peritumoural tissue adjacent to glioblastoma but is significantly less for meningioma, and (3) tPA is expressed in more heterogenous forms in glioblastoma.

"""Arginine Deprivation Therapy: Putative Strategy to Eradicate Glioblastoma Cells by Radiosensitization.""","""Tumor cells-even if nonauxotrophic-are often highly sensitive to arginine deficiency. We hypothesized that arginine deprivation therapy (ADT) if combined with irradiation could be a new treatment strategy for glioblastoma (GBM) patients because systemic ADT is independent of local penetration and diffusion limitations. A proof-of-principle in vitro study was performed with ADT being mimicked by application of recombinant human arginase or arginine-free diets. ADT inhibited two-dimensional (2-D) growth and cell-cycle progression, and reduced growth recovery after completion of treatment in four different GBM cell line models. Cells were less susceptible to ADT alone in the presence of citrulline and in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment. Migration and 3-D invasion were not unfavorably affected. However, ADT caused a significant radiosensitization that was more pronounced in a GBM cell model with p53 loss of function as compared with its p53-wildtype counterpart. The synergistic effect was independent of basic and induced argininosuccinate synthase or argininosuccinate lyase protein expression and not abrogated by the presence of citrulline. The radiosensitizing potential was maintained or even more distinguishable in a 3-D environment as verified in p53-knockdown and p53-wildtype U87-MG cells via a 60-day spheroid control probability assay. Although the underlying mechanism is still ambiguous, the observation of ADT-induced radiosensitization is of great clinical interest, in particular for patients with GBM showing high radioresistance and/or p53 loss of function.

Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of an array of GBM samples showed that high levels of CHRM3 correlated with poor prognosis, consistent with The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Knockdown of CHRM3 inhibited GBM cell growth and invasion. An assay of orthotopic GBM animal model in vivo indicated that inhibition of CHRM3 significantly suppressed GBM progression with prolonged survival time. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CHRM3 knockdown significantly reduced an array of classic factors involved in cancer invasive growth, including MMP1/MMP3/MMP10/MMP12 and CXCL1/CXCL5/CXCL8.

Unveiling mechanisms causing this process is a logic goal to impair the killing capacity of GBM cells by molecular targeting.We noticed that our long-term GBM cultures, established from different patients, may display two categories/types of growth behavior in an orthotopic xenograft model: expansion of the tumor mass and formation of tumor branches/nodules (nodular like, NL-type) or highly diffuse single tumor cell infiltration (HD-type). Methods: We determined by DNA microarrays the gene expression profiles of three NL-type and three HD-type long-term GBM cultures. Subsequently, individual genes with different expression levels between the two groups were identified using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). Real time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses, were performed for a selected subgroup of regulated gene products to confirm the results obtained by the expression analysis. Results: Here, we report the identification of a set of 34 differentially expressed genes in the two types of GBM cultures. Twenty-three of these genes encode for proteins localized to the plasma membrane and 9 of these for proteins are involved in the process of cell adhesion.

"""Pathogenic mutations in neurofibromin identifies a leucine-rich domain regulating glioma cell invasiveness.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive tumor of the brain. NF1, a tumor suppressor gene and RAS-GTPase, is one of the highly mutated genes in GBM. Dysregulated NF1 expression promotes cell invasion, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Loss of NF1 expression in glioblastoma is associated with increased aggressiveness of the tumor. Here, we show that NF1-loss in patient-derived glioma cells using shRNA increases self-renewal, heightens cell invasion, and promotes mesenchymal subtype and epithelial mesenchymal transition-specific gene expression that enhances tumorigenesis. The neurofibromin protein contains at least four major domains, with the GAP-related domain being the most well-studied. In this study, we report that the leucine-rich domain (LRD) of neurofibromin inhibits invasion of human glioblastoma cells without affecting their proliferation. Moreover, under conditions tested, the NF1-LRD fails to hydrolyze Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, suggesting that its suppressive function is independent of Ras signaling. We further demonstrate that rare variants within the NF1-LRD domain found in a subset of the patients are pathogenic and reduce NF1-LRD's invasion suppressive function. Taken together, our results show, for the first time, that NF1-LRD inhibits glioma invasion, and provides evidence of a previously unrecognized function of NF1-LRD in glioma biology.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30967630

Fluorescence in the ventricular walls, which were apparently free of macroscopic tumor or MR imaging enhancement indicative of CSF dissemination, was detected during surgery for GBM. To evaluate the clinical significance of the 5-ALA fluorescence, the authors resected ventricle wall tissue together with the adjacent tumors for pathological examination and then followed up the clinical courses of the patients. Methods: Seven consecutive GBMs located near the lateral ventricle were surgically treated using a fluorescence-guided technique with 5-ALA at the authors' hospital since acquiring instrumentation for the detection of 5-ALA fluorescence in 2007. All of the procedures were performed using a ventricular entry, and 5-ALA fluorescence of the ventricular wall was detected despite the absence of macroscopic tumor invasion of the wall. Results: A pathological examination of the resected ventricular wall tissues revealed tumor cells in 6 of the 7 cases and disruption of the ependymal cell layer in all 7 cases. Delayed communicating hydrocephalus followed surgery in all 7 patients, and ventricular wall enhancements on MR imaging were demonstrated after hydrocephalus in 2 of the patients. Conclusions: Data in this study suggest that 5-ALA fluorescence of the ventricular wall may be predictive of postoperative hydrocephalus associated with CSF dissemination even in cases without evidence of CSF dissemination on MR imaging studies before surgery. The authors also speculate that postoperative radiotherapy covering the whole ventricular system may be a better therapeutic option for these patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19747042
"""N-cadherin, beta-catenin and connexin 43 expression in astrocytic tumours of various grades.""","""Introduction: Astrocytic tumors are the most common primary brain tumors, but little is known about their etiology and prognostic factors. N-cadherin and beta-catenin are adhesive proteins, and are often overexpressed in many types of cancers, including breast or colorectal cancer, resulting in better prognosis. Connexin 43 is a gap junction protein involved in cell-cell signaling pathway taking part in the process of carcinogenesis. The aim of the study was to evaluate N-cadherin, beta-catenin and connexin 43 expression in astrocytic tumors of various grades. Materials and methods: We examined 131 cases of astrocytic tumors, including 26 cases of diffuse astrocytoma (group I), 44 anaplasic astrocytomas (group II) and 61 glioblastoma cases (group III)--primary and secondary. To evaluate N-cadherin, beta-catenin and connexin 43 expression, we used immunohistochemical reaction with specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The obtained results were correlated with clinical and morphological features. Results: Beta-catenin expression was observed in 69.3% of diffuse astrocytomas, 75% of anaplastic astrocytomas, and 82% of glioblastoma cases. N-cadherin expression was observed in 92.3% of diffuse astrocytomas, 90.1% of anaplastic astyrocytomas, and in all glioblastoma cases. Connexin 43 was observed in 76.9% of diffuse astrocytomas, and in all cases of anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Beta-catenin expression was significant within the nucleus of neoplastic cells in groups I and II. In group III, staining was observed only in the cellular membranes. N-cadherin and connexin 43 expression was observed only in the cells' membranes. In glioblastomas, both primary and secondary, all protein expression was significant within the cells surrounding the necroses and blood vessels and weak or absent in the tumor's margins. Conclusion: Our study shows that beta-catenin nuclear expression in group of diffuse astrocytomas and anaplastic astrocytomas is evidence for transcriptional function of beta-catenin in those groups. Strong N-cadherin and connexin 43 expression in those groups may be evidence for their role in tumor formation and progression. However, in glioblastomas a very important role of all examined proteins is generating intracellular connections to facilitate the escape of tumor cells from the effects of hypoxia or their accumulation around the blood vessels rather than tumor invasion into the brain parenchyma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386667

Methods: We used 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure the MI concentrations in the tumor and contralateral control tissue of 39 prospectively recruited patients with recurrent glioblastomas before and 8-12 weeks after starting therapy. 30 patients received Bevacizumab and 9 patients were treated with CCNU/VM26 as control. We performed a survival analysis to evaluate MI as a predictive biomarker for Bevacizumab therapy. Results: MI concentrations increased significantly during Bevacizumab therapy in tumor (p < .001) and control tissue (p = .001), but not during CCNU/VM26 treatment. For the Bevacizumab cohort, higher MI concentrations in the control tissue at baseline (p = .021) and higher differences between control and tumor tissue (delta MI, p = .011) were associated with longer survival. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median OS of 164 days for patients with a deltaMI < 1,817 mmol/l and 275 days for patients with a deltaMI > 1,817 mmol/l. No differences were observed for the relative changes or the post treatment concentrations. Additionally calculated creatine concentrations showed no differences in between subgroups or between pre and post treatment measurements. Conclusion: Our data suggest that recurrent glioblastoma shows a strong metabolic reaction to Bevacizumab. Further, our results support the hypothesis that MI might be a marker for early tumor cell invasion. Pre-therapeutic MI concentrations are predictive of overall survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with Bevacizumab.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28033329
"""The role of ALDH1A1 in glioblastoma proliferation and invasion.""","""High-grade gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), continue to be a leading aggressive brain tumor in adults, marked by its rapid growth and invasive nature. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1), an enzyme, plays a significant role in tumor progression, yet its function in high-grade gliomas is still poorly investigated. In this study, we evaluated ALDH1A1 levels in clinical samples of GBM. We also assessed the prognostic significance of ALDH1A1 expression in GBM and LGG (low grade glioma) patients using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database analysis. The MTT and transwell assays were utilized to examine cell growth and the invasive capability of U87 cells, respectively. We quantitatively examined markers for cell proliferation (Ki-67 and cyclin D1) and invasion (MMP2 and 9). A Western blot test was conducted to determine the downstream signaling of ALDH1A1. We found a notable increase in ALDH1A1 expression in high-grade gliomas compared to their low-grade counterparts. U87 cells that overexpressed ALDH1A1 showed increased cell growth and invasion. We found that ALDH1A1 promotes the phosphorylation of AKT, and inhibiting AKT phosphorylation mitigates the ALDH1A1's effects on tumor growth and migration. In summary, our findings suggest ALDH1A1 as a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39128802

The aim of the study was to compare the migration abilities of glioma cells with those of other cancer cells and elucidate the migratory profiles underlying the differential migration of glioma cells using a fiber-based quantitative migration assay. Here, wound healing and transwell assays were used to assess cell mobility in four cell lines: U87-MG glioblastoma cells, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, and MKN45 gastric cancer cells. We also assessed cell mobility using a fiber model that mimics nerve fibers. Time-lapse video microscopy was used to observe cell migration and morphology. The cytoskeleton arrangement was assessed in the fiber model and compared with that in the conventional cell culture model. The conventional evaluation of cell migration ability revealed that the migration ability of breast cancer and glioblastoma cell lines was higher than that of colon cancer and gastric cancer cell lines. The fiber model confirmed that the glioblastoma cell line had a significantly higher migration ability than other cell lines. Tubulin levels were significantly higher in the glioblastoma cells than in other cell lines.

"""Dual-sgRNA CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of PD-L1 in human U87 glioblastoma tumor cells inhibits proliferation, invasion, and tumor-associated macrophage polarization.""","""Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) plays a key role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) immunosuppression, vitality, proliferation, and migration, and is therefore a promising target for treating GBM. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing can delete both cell surface and intracellular PD-L1. This systemic deliverable genomic PD-L1 deletion system can be used as an effective anti-GBM therapy by inhibiting tumor growth and migration, and overcoming immunosuppression. To target PD-L1 for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we first identified two single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences located on PD-L1 exon 3. The first sgRNA recognizes the forward strand of human PD-L1 near the beginning of exon 3 that allows editing by Cas9 at approximately base pair 82 (g82). The second sgRNA recognizes the forward strand of exon 3 that directs cutting at base pair 165 (g165). A homology-directed repair template (HDR) combined with the dual-sgRNAs was used to improve PD-L1 knockout specificity and efficiency. sgRNAs g82 and g165 were cloned into the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 assembly system and co-transfected with the HDR template in human U87 GBM cells (g82/165 + HDR). T7E1 analysis suggests that the dual-sgRNA CRISPR/Cas9 strategy with a repair template was capable of editing the genomic level of PD-L1. This was further confirmed by examining PD-L1 protein levels by western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Western blot analysis showed that the dual-sgRNAs with the repair template caused a 64% reduction of PD-L1 protein levels in U87 cells, while immunostaining showed a significant reduction of intracellular PD-L1. PD-L1 deletion inhibited proliferation, growth, invasion and migration of U87 cells, indicating intracellular PD-L1 is necessary for tumor progression. Importantly, U87 cells treated with g82/165 + HDR polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) toward an M1 phenotype, as indicated by an increase in TNF-Î± and a decrease in IL-4 secretions. This was further confirmed with flow cytometry that showed an increase in the M1 markers Ly6C + and CD80 +, and a decrease in the M2 marker CD206 + both in vitro and in vivo.

Fatty acids have been studied as an adjuvant cancer treatment in breast, colorectal and GBM. The fatty acid can alter tumoural cell metabolism causing a modification of eicosanoids production. This study has observed some cellular aspects modified by fatty acid treatment in vitro, using GBM cells (human and rat). Modifications in cell behaviour were analyzed like cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion cell capacity after treatment with fatty acid (gamma-linolenic acid).

Accumulating evidences show that baicalin induces autophagy and apoptosis to suppress the cancer growth. Moreover, the antineoplastic role of baicalin in human glioblastoma cells remains to be uncovered. Methods: Both U87 and U251 human glioblastoma cell lines were employed in the present study. Cell viability was tested by Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony-forming assay; Flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and Ca2+ content. Cell immunofluorescence assays were used for analyzing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), light chain 3 beta (LC3B), 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-imidacarbocyanineiodide (JC-1), and Ca2+ content. The protein levels were tested by Western blot. The SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Baicalin suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of human glioblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Baicalin induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and led to mitochondrial apoptosis. The maturation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-LC3B indicated the activation of autophagy potentially through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine decreased the apoptotic cell ratio. Besides, baicalin increased the intercellular Ca2+ content; meanwhile, chelation of free Ca2+ by 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid inhibited both apoptotic and autophagy. Finally, baicalin suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that baicalin exerts cytotoxic effects on human glioblastoma cells by the autophagy-related apoptosis through Ca2+ movement to the cytosol.

"""Role of Nucleobindin-2 in the Clinical Pathogenesis and Treatment Resistance of Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) stands as the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor, typically resulting in a median survival period of approximately thirteen to fifteen months after undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) is a protein involved in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis. In this study, we assessed the impact of NUCB2 expression on tumor progression and prognosis of GBM. We further evaluated the relationship between NUCB2 expression and the sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in GBM cells. Additionally, we compared the survival of mice intracranially implanted with GBM cells. High NUCB2 expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM. Knockdown of NUCB2 reduced cell viability, migration ability, and invasion ability of GBM cells. Overexpression of NUCB2 resulted in reduced apoptosis following temozolomide treatment and increased levels of DNA damage repair proteins after radiotherapy. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with NUCB2 knockdown GBM cells exhibited longer survival compared to the control group. NUCB2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes in patients with GBM. Additionally, NUCB2 not only contributes to tumor progression but also influences the sensitivity of GBM cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, targeting NUCB2 protein expression may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37830634

In addition, the involvement of the nuclear factorâÎºB (NFâÎºB) signaling pathway in the action of PROX1 was examined. It was identified that overexpression of PROX1 significantly increased the proliferation and colony formation of glioblastoma cells, compared with empty vectorâtransfected controls. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PROX1 promoted the growth of GBM xenograft tumors. Western blot analysis revealed that PROX1 overexpression induced nuclear accumulation of NFâÎºB p65 and upregulated the expression levels of the NFâÎºB responsive genes cyclin D1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9. An NFâÎºB reporter assay demonstrated that PROX1âoverexpressing glioblastoma cells had significantly greater NFâÎºBâdependent reporter activities compared with empty vectorâtransfected controls.

"""Allopregnanolone Promotes Migration and Invasion of Human Glioblastoma Cells through the Protein Tyrosine Kinase c-Src Activation.""","""Glioblastomas (GBs) are the most aggressive and common primary malignant brain tumors. Steroid hormone progesterone (P4) and its neuroactive metabolites, such as allopregnanolone (3Î±-THP) are synthesized by neural, glial, and malignant GB cells. P4 promotes cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion of human GB cells at physiological concentrations. It has been reported that 3Î±-THP promotes GB cell proliferation. Here we investigated the effects of 3Î±-THP on GB cell migration and invasion, the participation of the enzymes involved in its metabolism (AKR1C1-4), and the role of the c-Src kinase in 3Î±-THP effects in GBs. 3Î±-THP 100 nM promoted migration and invasion of U251, U87, and LN229 human-derived GB cell lines. We observed that U251, LN229, and T98G cell lines exhibited a higher protein content of AKR1C1-4 than normal human astrocytes. AKR1C1-4 silencing did not modify 3Î±-THP effects on migration and invasion. 3Î±-THP activated c-Src protein at 10 min (U251 cells) and 15 min (U87 and LN229 cells). Interestingly, the pharmacological inhibition of c-Src decreases the promoting effects of 3Î±-THP on cell migration and invasion.

"""Cross-activating c-Met/beta1 integrin complex drives metastasis and invasive resistance in cancer.""","""The molecular underpinnings of invasion, a hallmark of cancer, have been defined in terms of individual mediators but crucial interactions between these mediators remain undefined. In xenograft models and patient specimens, we identified a c-Met/Î²1 integrin complex that formed during significant invasive oncologic processes: breast cancer metastases and glioblastoma invasive resistance to antiangiogenic VEGF neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab. Inducing c-Met/Î²1 complex formation through an engineered inducible heterodimerization system promoted features crucial to overcoming stressors during metastases or antiangiogenic therapy: migration in the primary site, survival under hypoxia, and extravasation out of circulation. c-Met/Î²1 complex formation was up-regulated by hypoxia, while VEGF binding VEGFR2 sequestered c-Met and Î²1 integrin, preventing their binding. Complex formation promoted ligand-independent receptor activation, with integrin-linked kinase phosphorylating c-Met and crystallography revealing the c-Met/Î²1 complex to maintain the high-affinity Î²1 integrin conformation. Site-directed mutagenesis verified the necessity for c-Met/Î²1 binding of amino acids predicted by crystallography to mediate their extracellular interaction. Far-Western blotting and sequential immunoprecipitation revealed that c-Met displaced Î±5 integrin from Î²1 integrin, creating a complex with much greater affinity for fibronectin (FN) than Î±5Î²1. Thus, tumor cells adapt to microenvironmental stressors induced by metastases or bevacizumab by coopting receptors, which normally promote both cell migration modes: chemotaxis, movement toward concentrations of environmental chemoattractants, and haptotaxis, movement controlled by the relative strengths of peripheral adhesions. Tumor cells then redirect these receptors away from their conventional binding partners, forming a powerful structural c-Met/Î²1 complex whose ligand-independent cross-activation and robust affinity for FN drive invasive oncologic processes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28973887

The NR4A2 ligand, 1,1-bis (31-indoly1)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)methane (DIM-C-pPhCl) inhibits markers of neuroinflammation and degeneration in mouse models and in this study we investigated expression and function of NR4A2 in glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: Established and patient-derived cell lines were used as models and the expression and functions of NR4A2 were determined by western blots and NR4A2 gene silencing by antisense oligonucleotides respectively. Effects of NR4A2 knockdown and DIM-C-pPhCl on cell growth, induction of apoptosis (Annexin V Staining) and migration/invasion (Boyden chamber and spheroid invasion assay) and transactivation of NR4A2-regulated reporter genes were determined. Tumor growth was investigated in athymic nude mice bearing U87-MG cells as xenografts. Results: NR4A2 knockdown and DIM-C-pPhCl inhibited GBM cell and tumor growth, induced apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion of GBM cells. DIM-C-pPhCl and related analogs also inhibited NR4A2-regulated transactivation (luciferase activity) confirming that DIM-C-pPhCl acts as an NR4A2 antagonist and blocks NR4A2-dependent pro-oncogenic responses in GBM. Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first time that NR4A2 is pro-oncogenic in GBM and thus a potential druggable target for patients with tumors expressing this receptor.

"""Tracking tumour evolution in glioma through liquid biopsies of cerebrospinal fluid.""","""Diffuse gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumours in adults and include glioblastomas and World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III tumours (sometimes referred to as lower-grade gliomas). Genetic tumour profiling is used to classify disease and guide therapy1,2, but involves brain surgery for tissue collection; repeated tumour biopsies may be necessary for accurate genotyping over the course of the disease3-10. While the detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with primary brain tumours remains challenging11,12, sequencing of ctDNA from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may provide an alternative way to genotype gliomas with lower morbidity and cost13,14. We therefore evaluated the representation of the glioma genome in CSF from 85 patients with gliomas who underwent a lumbar puncture because they showed neurological signs or symptoms. Here we show that tumour-derived DNA was detected in CSF from 42 out of 85 patients (49.4%) and was associated with disease burden and adverse outcome. The genomic landscape of glioma in the CSF included a broad spectrum of genetic alterations and closely resembled the genomes of tumour biopsies. Alterations that occur early during tumorigenesis, such as co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) and mutations in the metabolic genes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH21,2, were shared in all matched ctDNA-positive CSF-tumour pairs, whereas growth factor receptor signalling pathways showed considerable evolution.

"""Activation of membrane progesterone receptor-alpha increases proliferation, migration, and invasion of human glioblastoma cells.""","""Background and aims: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive brain tumor due to its high capacity to migrate and invade normal brain tissue. The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) contributes to the progression of glioblastoma by promoting proliferation, migration, and cellular invasion through the activation of its intracellular receptor (PR). However, the use of PR antagonist RU486 partially blocks the effects of P4, suggesting the participation of signaling pathways such as those mediated by membrane receptors to P4 (mPRs). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of mPRÎ± subtype activation on proliferation, migration, and invasion of human glioblastoma cells. Methods: We treated human glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 with the specific mPRÎ± agonist Org OD 02-0, and evaluated its effects on cell number, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we measured the phosphorylation of the kinases Src and Akt in both cell lines upon Org OD 02-0 treatment. Results: Org OD 02-0 (100 nM) augmented the number of U87 and U251 cells by increasing cell proliferation. The treatment with this agonist also increased U87 and U251 cell migration and invasion. Both proliferation and cell invasion decreased when mPRÎ± expression was silenced. Finally, we observed that Org OD 02-0 increased the content of p-Src and p-Akt in both cell lines.

Eight of the 12 patients were diagnosed antemortem with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, while the other 4 patients were diagnosed at autopsy only. All 11 autopsied patients had multifocal or diffuse meningeal tumor distant from the primary site; 8 patients had spinal subarachnoid seeding with tumor encroachment of cauda equina and spinal nerve roots, and 9 patients had tumor invasion into the lateral ventricles. Three patients had symptomatic spinal cord compression at the thoracic or lumbar level, and 10 patients had hydrocephalus. These 12 patients with meningeal gliomatosis were compared with the other 41 autopsied malignant glioma patients without the complication (controls); the patients with meningeal gliomatosis were significantly younger (mean age, 40 versus 57 years; p less than 0.005). Patients with meningeal gliomatosis lived somewhat longer (median, 49 weeks) compared to controls (35 weeks), but the difference was not statistically significant. With the advance of chemotherapy, patients with malignant glioma are living longer and the incidence of meningeal gliomatosis may rise.

Accordingly, while WT Î133p53Î± reduces apoptosis to promote DNA repair, mutant R273H also reduces apoptosis but fails to maintain genomic stability, increasing the risks of accumulation of mutations and tumor's deriving towards a more aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, using 2D and 3D spheroids culture, we show that WT Î133p53Î± reduces cell proliferation, EMT, and invasion, while the mutant Î133p53Î± R273H enhances all three processes, confirming its oncogenic potential and strongly suggesting a similar in vivo activity. Importantly, the effects on cell growth and invasion are independent of mutant full-length p53Î±, indicating that these activities are actively carried by mutant Î133p53Î± R273H. Furthermore, both WT and mutant Î133p53Î± reduce cellular senescence in a senescence inducer-dependent manner (temozolomide or radiation) because they regulate different senescence-associated target genes.

The purpose of the current study was to examine higher order diffusion characteristics in human glioblastoma prior to surgical resection using the fourth-order diffusion tensor model. Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma participated in the study. Diffusion-weighted images were collected in 21 directions. The second-order (traditional) and fourth-order diffusion tensors were calculated and compared in regions of contrast enhancement, T2 signal abnormality, and normal-appearing white matter. Results: Orientation distribution functions were strikingly different between the two tensor models, particularly in regions with tumor heterogeneity and/or regions of suspected tumor invasion. Image contrast was significantly higher in fourth-order scalar measures compared to second-order scalars. Results of particular eigenvalues and scalars using the fourth-order tensor showed differences between T2 abnormal regions and contrast enhancement, whereas second-order eigenvalues and scalars did not show differences. This suggests that higher order diffusion images could potentially be more sensitive to tumor invasion.

We observed 78-88% of the miR-379/miR-656 cluster (C14MC) miRNAs were downregulated in three sub-types of diffuse gliomas, which was also corroborated with analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. The miRNA expression levels decreased with increasing tumor grade, indicating this downregulation as an early event in gliomagenesis. Higher expression of the C14MC miRNAs significantly improved glioblastioma prognosis (Pearson's r = 0.62; p < 3.08e-22). ENCODE meta-data analysis, followed by reporter assays validated existence of two novel internal regulators within C14MC. CRISPR activation of the most efficient internal regulator specifically induced members of the downstream miRNA sub-cluster and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Luciferase assays validated novel targets for miR-134 and miR-485-5p, two miRNAs from C14MC with the most number of target genes relevant for glioma. Overexpression of miR-134 and miR-485-5p in human glioblastoma cells suppressed invasion and proliferation, respectively.

In this work, the growth and invasiveness of human glioblastoma spheroids xenografted into nude rat brains were assessed after radiosurgery. Temporary in vitro as well as long-term in vivo radiation effects were studied. Methods: Glioblastoma biopsy spheroids were irradiated with 12 or 24 Gy. Short-term in vitro spheroid viability and tumour cell migration was determined by microscopic techniques. Pre-irradiated glioblastoma spheroids were implanted into brains of immunosuppressed rats. Long-term tumour development was assessed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and animal survival was recorded. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the sectioned rat brains. Results: Both un-irradiated and irradiated spheroids remained viable during 2 months in culture, but a dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth and migration was seen. MR imaging 4 weeks after implantation also showed a dose-dependent inhibition in tumour development. Median animal survival times were 25.5 days (control group), 43 days (12 Gy group) and 96 days (24 Gy group). The study of in vivo long-term radiation effects on the remaining viable tumour population showed no difference in Ki-67 labelling index and microvascular density before and after radiosurgery. Conclusions: A dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth and invasion, as well as a dose-dependent increase in animal survival was observed. The model system described is well suited for assessing the radiobiological effects of Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The results indicate that radiosurgery of malignant gliomas might be effective in controlling tumour progression in selected glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16955221
"""High expression of PCBP2 is associated with progression and poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Background: Poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) has been found to have ambiguous functions in a variety of cancers. However, the specific biological function of PCBP2 and its mechanism in glioblastoma remain unclear. We investigated the expression of PCBP2 in 143 glioblastoma specimens to explore the linkage between PCBP2 expression and clinicopathological parameters as well as clinical significance. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of PCBP2 on glioblastoma progression were discussed in vitro. Methods: The transcriptional and translational levels of PCBP2 in 143 glioblastoma patients were detected by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The association of prognostic outcomes and PCBP2 expression was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: PCBP2 expression was markedly increased in higher stages of glioblastoma compared with those in lower stages (P<0.001). High expression of PCBP2 was associated with higher clinical stage and histological grade (P<0.001). Further research suggested that PCBP2 upregulation was connected with poorer prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (P<0.001). Moreover, PCBP2 knockdown could significantly decreased the colony formation and invasion capability of glioblastoma cells (P<0.01). Conversely, PCBP2 overexpression could increase the colony formation and invasion capability (P<0.01). Conclusion: These findings indicated that PCBP2 might be a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28787701
