Title,Abstract,Link
Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Defining histopathologic features are necrosis and endothelial proliferation, resulting in the assignment of grade IV, the highest grade in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors. The classic clinical term ""secondary glioblastoma"" refers to a minority of glioblastomas that evolve from previously diagnosed WHO grade II or grade III gliomas. Specific point mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 appear to define molecularly these tumors that are associated with younger age and more favorable outcome; the vast majority of glioblastomas are IDH wild-type. Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) signaling. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. Promoter methylation of the gene encoding the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide and guides choice of first-line treatment in elderly patients. Current developments focus on targeting the molecular characteristics that drive the malignant phenotype, including altered signal transduction and angiogenesis, and more recently, various approaches of immunotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948367
Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.,"Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541850
A Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoid Model and Biobank Recapitulates Inter- and Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity.,"Glioblastomas exhibit vast inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models are limited in preserving the cellular and mutational diversity of parental tumors and require a prolonged generation time. Here, we report methods for generating and biobanking patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) that recapitulate the histological features, cellular diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of their corresponding parental tumors. GBOs can be generated quickly with high reliability and exhibit rapid, aggressive infiltration when transplanted into adult rodent brains. We further demonstrate the utility of GBOs to test personalized therapies by correlating GBO mutational profiles with responses to specific drugs and by modeling chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. Our studies show that GBOs maintain many key features of glioblastomas and can be rapidly deployed to investigate patient-specific treatment strategies. Additionally, our live biobank establishes a rich resource for basic and translational glioblastoma research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883794
Glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas: a clinical review.,"Importance:
        
      
      Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications.
    


          Evidence review:
        
      
      Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis.
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193082
Recent Developments in Glioblastoma Therapy: Oncolytic Viruses and Emerging Future Strategies.,Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. Standard treatment protocols and traditional immunotherapy are poorly effective as they do not significantly increase the long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) may be an effective alternative approach. Combining OVs with some modern treatment options may also provide significant benefits for glioblastoma patients. Here we review virotherapy for glioblastomas and describe several OVs and their combination with other therapies. The personalized use of OVs and their combination with other treatment options would become a significant area of research aiming to develop the most effective treatment regimens for glioblastomas.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851761
Glioblastoma stem cells: lessons from the tumor hierarchy in a lethal cancer.,"Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of all human cancers. Glioblastomas display striking cellular heterogeneity, with stem-like glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex. Although the original identification of GSCs dates back more than a decade, the purification and characterization of GSCs remains challenging. Despite these challenges, the evidence that GSCs play important roles in tumor growth and response to therapy has grown. Like normal stem cells, GSCs are functionally defined and distinguished from their differentiated tumor progeny at core transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulatory levels, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality will be universally effective against a heterogenous GSC population. Glioblastomas induce a systemic immunosuppression with mixed responses to oncoimmunologic modalities, suggesting the potential for augmentation of response with a deeper consideration of GSCs. Unfortunately, the GSC literature has been complicated by frequent use of inferior cell lines and a lack of proper functional analyses. Collectively, glioblastoma offers a reliable cancer to study cancer stem cells to better model the human disease and inform improved biologic understanding and design of novel therapeutics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160393
Glioblastoma stem cell metabolism and immunity.,"Despite enormous efforts being invested in the development of novel therapies for brain malignancies, there remains a dire need for effective treatments, particularly for pediatric glioblastomas. Their poor prognosis has been attributed to the fact that conventional therapies target tumoral cells, but not glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are characterized by self-renewal, tumorigenicity, poor differentiation, and resistance to therapy. These characteristics represent the fundamental tools needed to recapitulate the tumor and result in a relapse. The mechanisms by which GSCs alter metabolic cues and escape elimination by immune cells are discussed in this article, along with potential strategies to harness effector immune cells against GSCs. As cellular immunotherapy is making significant advances in a variety of cancers, leveraging this underexplored reservoir may result in significant improvements in the treatment options for brain malignancies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38530545
A comprehensive profile of recurrent glioblastoma.,"In spite of relentless efforts to devise new treatment strategies, primary glioblastomas invariably recur as aggressive, therapy-resistant relapses and patients rapidly succumb to these tumors. Many therapeutic agents are first tested in clinical trials involving recurrent glioblastomas. Remarkably, however, fundamental knowledge on the biology of recurrent glioblastoma is just slowly emerging. Here, we review current knowledge on recurrent glioblastoma and ask whether and how therapies change intra-tumor heterogeneity, molecular traits and growth pattern of glioblastoma, and to which extent this information can be exploited for therapeutic decision-making. We conclude that the ability to characterize and predict therapy-induced changes in recurrent glioblastoma will determine, whether, one day, glioblastoma can be contained in a state of chronic disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041580
The definition of primary and secondary glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. The vast majority of glioblastomas (~90%) develop rapidly de novo in elderly patients, without clinical or histologic evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastomas). Secondary glioblastomas progress from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. They manifest in younger patients, have a lesser degree of necrosis, are preferentially located in the frontal lobe, and carry a significantly better prognosis. Histologically, primary and secondary glioblastomas are largely indistinguishable, but they differ in their genetic and epigenetic profiles. Decisive genetic signposts of secondary glioblastoma are IDH1 mutations, which are absent in primary glioblastomas and which are associated with a hypermethylation phenotype. IDH1 mutations are the earliest detectable genetic alteration in precursor low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and in oligodendrogliomas, indicating that these tumors are derived from neural precursor cells that differ from those of primary glioblastomas. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical, histopathologic, genetic, and expression features of primary and secondary glioblastomas and the biologic consequences of IDH1 mutations. We conclude that this genetic alteration is a definitive diagnostic molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas and more reliable and objective than clinical criteria. Despite a similar histologic appearance, primary and secondary glioblastomas are distinct tumor entities that originate from different precursor cells and may require different therapeutic approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23209033
"Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms of recurrent glioblastoma.","Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors. Despite the availability of standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), i.e., Stupp protocol, which involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains refractory to treatment and recurrence is inevitable. Moreover, the biology of recurrent glioblastoma remains unclear. Increasing evidence has shown that intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapeutic resistance. However, the interaction between intracellular heterogeneity and drug resistance in recurrent GBMs remains controversial. The aim of this study was to map the transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in recurrent and drug-resistant GBMs at a single-cell resolution and further explore the mechanism of drug resistance of GBMs. We analyzed six tumor tissue samples from three patients with primary GBM and three patients with recurrent GBM in which recurrence and drug resistance developed after treatment with the standard Stupp protocol using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using unbiased clustering, nine major cell clusters were identified. Upregulation of the expression of stemness-related and cell-cycle-related genes was observed in recurrent GBM cells. Compared with the initial GBM tissues, recurrent GBM tissues showed a decreased proportion of microglia, consistent with previous reports. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and the blood-brain barrier permeability were high, and the O6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-related signaling pathway was activated in recurrent GBM. Our results delineate the single-cell map of recurrent glioblastoma, tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms, providing new insights into treatment strategies for recurrent glioblastomas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36853018
Glioblastoma and brain connectivity: the need for a paradigm shift.,"Despite substantial advances in cancer treatment, for patients with glioblastoma prognosis remains bleak. The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reveals intricate functional interplays between glioblastoma and the cellular architecture of the brain, encompassing neurons, glia, and vessels. New findings underscore the role of structural and functional connections within hierarchical networks, known as the connectome. These connections contribute to the location, spread, and recurrence of a glioblastoma, and a patient's overall survival, revealing a complex interplay between the tumour and the CNS. This mounting evidence prompts a paradigm shift, challenging the perception of glioblastomas as mere foreign bodies within the brain. Instead, these tumours are intricately woven into the structural and functional fabric of the brain. This radical change in thinking holds profound implications for the understanding and treatment of glioblastomas, which could unveil new prognostic factors and surgical strategies and optimise radiotherapy. Additionally, a connectivity approach suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation could disrupt pathological neuron-glioma interactions within specific networks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38876751
Understanding glioblastoma at the single-cell level: Recent advances and future challenges.,"Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38814900
Identification of hypoxic macrophages in glioblastoma: Unveiling therapeutic insights from tumour microenvironment analysis.,"Tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs) exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in glioblastoma. Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic studies identified a monocyte-derived TAM subset localized in the peri-necrotic niche, driven by hypoxic cues to acquire ahypoxia response signature. These hypoxia-TAMs destabilize endothelial adherens junctions through adrenomedullin paracrine signaling, promoting the formation of hyperpermeable neovasculature that impedes drug delivery. Blocking adrenomedullin produced by hypoxia-TAMs restores vascular integrity, increases drug deliveryinto tumors, and provides combinatorial therapeutic benefits. Here we discuss the heterogeneity of TAMs regarding functional states and locations in glioblastomas, and propose future directions for studying the temporospatial dynamics of multifaceted TAM. HIGHLIGHTS: Single-cell omics reveal a functionally and spatially distinct hypoxia-TAM subset in glioblastoma. Adrenomedullin secreted by hypoxia-TAM destabilizes tumor vasculature and its blockade enhances vessel integrity and drug delivery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39297872
[Glioblastoma in 2017].,"Glioblastomas are serious tumours of the central nervous system. Recurrence is systematic and prognosis poor. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy follow surgery, when surgery is possible, to lengthen survival, while preserving quality of life as much as possible. In this respect, symptomatic treatments and supportive care are necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28160825
Single-cell characterization of macrophages in glioblastoma reveals MARCO as a mesenchymal pro-tumor marker.,"Background:
        
      
      Macrophages are the most common infiltrating immune cells in gliomas and play a wide variety of pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. However, the different subpopulations of macrophages and their effects on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We combined new and previously published single-cell RNA-seq data from 98,015 single cells from a total of 66 gliomas to profile 19,331 individual macrophages.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Unsupervised clustering revealed a pro-tumor subpopulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages characterized by the scavenger receptor MARCO, which is almost exclusively found in IDH1-wild-type glioblastomas. Previous studies have implicated MARCO as an unfavorable marker in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; here, we find that bulk MARCO expression is associated with worse prognosis and mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, MARCO expression is significantly altered over the course of treatment with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors in a response-dependent manner, which we validate with immunofluorescence imaging.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These findings illustrate a novel macrophage subpopulation that drives tumor progression in glioblastomas and suggest potential therapeutic targets to prevent their recruitment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34011400
Perioperative Management of Patients with Glioblastoma.,"The clinical presentation of glioblastomas is varied, and definitive diagnosis requires pathologic examination and study of the tissue. Management of glioblastomas includes surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with surgery playing an important role in the prognosis of these patients. Awake craniotomy plays a crucial role in tumors in or adjacent to eloquent areas, allowing surgeons to maximize resection, while minimizing iatrogenic deficits. However, the prognosis remains dismal. This article presents the perioperative management of patients with glioblastoma including tools and surgical adjuncts to maximize extent of resection and minimize poor outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223018
"Exosomes: Their role in the diagnosis, progression, metastasis, and treatment of glioblastoma.","Exosomes are crucial for the growth and spread of glioblastomas, an aggressive form of brain cancer. These tiny vesicles play a crucial role in the activation of signaling pathways and intercellular communication. They can also transfer a variety of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor to recipient cells. Exosomes can influence the immune response by regulating the activity of immune cells, and they are crucial for the growth and metastasis of glioblastoma cells. In addition, exosomes contribute to drug resistance during treatment, which is a major obstacle in the treatment of glioblastoma. By studying them, the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma can be improved. Due to their high biocompatibility and lack of toxicity, they have become an attractive option for drug delivery. The development of exosomes as carriers of specific therapeutic agents could overcome some of the obstacles to effective treatment of glioblastoma. In this review, we address the potential of exosomes for the treatment of glioblastoma and show how they can be modified for this purpose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806071
Glioblastoma stem cells.,"Glioblastomas are highly malignant primary brain tumors with one of the worst survival rates among all human cancers. With a more profound understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and acquired resistance to conventional radio- and chemotherapy, novel therapeutic targets might be discovered to optimize therapeutic approaches. In this regard, the identification of a small cellular subpopulation, called glioblastoma stem cell or stem-like cells or glioma-initiating cells or brain tumor propagating cells, has gained attention. In this article, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge about this tumor cell population and discuss future directions for basic and clinical research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21253762
Therapeutics and Research Related to Glioblastoma: Advancements and Future Targets.,"Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has been recognized as one of the most lethal and fatal human tumors. It has a dismal prognosis, and survival after diagnosis is less than 15 months. Surgery and radiotherapy are the only available treatment options at present. However, numerous approaches have been made to upgrade in vivo and in vitro models with the primary goal of assessing abnormal molecular pathways that would be suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Novel drugs, delivery systems, and immunotherapy strategies to establish new multimodal therapies that target the molecular pathways involved in tumor initiation and progression in glioblastoma are being studied. The goal of this review was to describe the pathophysiology, neurodegeneration mechanisms, signaling pathways, and future therapeutic targets associated with glioblastomas. The key features have been detailed to provide an up-to-date summary of the advancement required in current diagnosis and therapeutics for glioblastoma. The role of nanoparticulate system graphene quantum dots as suitable therapy for glioblastoma has also been discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268863
Risk factors for glioblastoma are shared by other brain tumor types.,"The reported risk factors for glioblastoma (GBM), i.e., ionizing radiation, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Neurofibromatosis I, and Turcot syndrome, also increase the risk of other brain tumor types. Risk factors for human GBM are associated with different oncogenic mutation profiles. Pedigreed domestic dogs with a shorter nose and flatter face (brachycephalic dogs) display relatively high rates of glioma formation. The genetic profiles of canine gliomas are also idiosyncratic. The association of putatively different mutational patterns in humans and canines with GBM suggests that different oncogenic pathways can result in GBM formation. Strong epidemiological evidence for an association between exposure to chemical carcinogens and an increased risk for development of GBM is currently lacking. Ionizing radiation induces point mutations, frameshift mutations, double-strand breaks, and chromosomal insertions or deletions. Mutational profiles associated with chemical exposures overlap with the broad mutational patterns seen with ionizing radiation. Weak statistical associations between chemical exposures and GBM reported in epidemiology studies are biologically plausible. Molecular approaches comparing reproducible patterns seen in spontaneous GBM with analogous patterns found in GBMs resected from patients with known significant exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals can address difficulties presented by traditional exposure assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520250
