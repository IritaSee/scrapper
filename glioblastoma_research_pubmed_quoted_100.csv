"""Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Defining histopathologic features are necrosis and endothelial proliferation, resulting in the assignment of grade IV, the highest grade in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors. The classic clinical term 'secondary glioblastoma' refers to a minority of glioblastomas that evolve from previously diagnosed WHO grade II or grade III gliomas. Specific point mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 appear to define molecularly these tumors that are associated with younger age and more favorable outcome; the vast majority of glioblastomas are IDH wild-type. Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) signaling. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. Promoter methylation of the gene encoding the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide and guides choice of first-line treatment in elderly patients. Current developments focus on targeting the molecular characteristics that drive the malignant phenotype, including altered signal transduction and angiogenesis, and more recently, various approaches of immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26948367
"""Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541850
"""A Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoid Model and Biobank Recapitulates Inter- and Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity.""","""Glioblastomas exhibit vast inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models are limited in preserving the cellular and mutational diversity of parental tumors and require a prolonged generation time. Here, we report methods for generating and biobanking patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) that recapitulate the histological features, cellular diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of their corresponding parental tumors. GBOs can be generated quickly with high reliability and exhibit rapid, aggressive infiltration when transplanted into adult rodent brains. We further demonstrate the utility of GBOs to test personalized therapies by correlating GBO mutational profiles with responses to specific drugs and by modeling chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. Our studies show that GBOs maintain many key features of glioblastomas and can be rapidly deployed to investigate patient-specific treatment strategies. Additionally, our live biobank establishes a rich resource for basic and translational glioblastoma research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883794
"""Glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas: a clinical review.""","""Importance: Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. Objective: To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications. Evidence review: Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system. Findings: Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis. Conclusions and relevance: Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193082
"""Recent Developments in Glioblastoma Therapy: Oncolytic Viruses and Emerging Future Strategies.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. Standard treatment protocols and traditional immunotherapy are poorly effective as they do not significantly increase the long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) may be an effective alternative approach. Combining OVs with some modern treatment options may also provide significant benefits for glioblastoma patients. Here we review virotherapy for glioblastomas and describe several OVs and their combination with other therapies. The personalized use of OVs and their combination with other treatment options would become a significant area of research aiming to develop the most effective treatment regimens for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851761
"""Glioblastoma stem cells: lessons from the tumor hierarchy in a lethal cancer.""","""Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of all human cancers. Glioblastomas display striking cellular heterogeneity, with stem-like glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex. Although the original identification of GSCs dates back more than a decade, the purification and characterization of GSCs remains challenging. Despite these challenges, the evidence that GSCs play important roles in tumor growth and response to therapy has grown. Like normal stem cells, GSCs are functionally defined and distinguished from their differentiated tumor progeny at core transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulatory levels, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality will be universally effective against a heterogenous GSC population. Glioblastomas induce a systemic immunosuppression with mixed responses to oncoimmunologic modalities, suggesting the potential for augmentation of response with a deeper consideration of GSCs. Unfortunately, the GSC literature has been complicated by frequent use of inferior cell lines and a lack of proper functional analyses. Collectively, glioblastoma offers a reliable cancer to study cancer stem cells to better model the human disease and inform improved biologic understanding and design of novel therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160393
"""Glioblastoma stem cell metabolism and immunity.""","""Despite enormous efforts being invested in the development of novel therapies for brain malignancies, there remains a dire need for effective treatments, particularly for pediatric glioblastomas. Their poor prognosis has been attributed to the fact that conventional therapies target tumoral cells, but not glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are characterized by self-renewal, tumorigenicity, poor differentiation, and resistance to therapy. These characteristics represent the fundamental tools needed to recapitulate the tumor and result in a relapse. The mechanisms by which GSCs alter metabolic cues and escape elimination by immune cells are discussed in this article, along with potential strategies to harness effector immune cells against GSCs. As cellular immunotherapy is making significant advances in a variety of cancers, leveraging this underexplored reservoir may result in significant improvements in the treatment options for brain malignancies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38530545
"""A comprehensive profile of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""In spite of relentless efforts to devise new treatment strategies, primary glioblastomas invariably recur as aggressive, therapy-resistant relapses and patients rapidly succumb to these tumors. Many therapeutic agents are first tested in clinical trials involving recurrent glioblastomas. Remarkably, however, fundamental knowledge on the biology of recurrent glioblastoma is just slowly emerging. Here, we review current knowledge on recurrent glioblastoma and ask whether and how therapies change intra-tumor heterogeneity, molecular traits and growth pattern of glioblastoma, and to which extent this information can be exploited for therapeutic decision-making. We conclude that the ability to characterize and predict therapy-induced changes in recurrent glioblastoma will determine, whether, one day, glioblastoma can be contained in a state of chronic disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041580
"""The definition of primary and secondary glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor. The vast majority of glioblastomas (~90%) develop rapidly de novo in elderly patients, without clinical or histologic evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastomas). Secondary glioblastomas progress from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. They manifest in younger patients, have a lesser degree of necrosis, are preferentially located in the frontal lobe, and carry a significantly better prognosis. Histologically, primary and secondary glioblastomas are largely indistinguishable, but they differ in their genetic and epigenetic profiles. Decisive genetic signposts of secondary glioblastoma are IDH1 mutations, which are absent in primary glioblastomas and which are associated with a hypermethylation phenotype. IDH1 mutations are the earliest detectable genetic alteration in precursor low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and in oligodendrogliomas, indicating that these tumors are derived from neural precursor cells that differ from those of primary glioblastomas. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical, histopathologic, genetic, and expression features of primary and secondary glioblastomas and the biologic consequences of IDH1 mutations. We conclude that this genetic alteration is a definitive diagnostic molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas and more reliable and objective than clinical criteria. Despite a similar histologic appearance, primary and secondary glioblastomas are distinct tumor entities that originate from different precursor cells and may require different therapeutic approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23209033
"""Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous brain tumors. Despite the availability of standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), i.e., Stupp protocol, which involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains refractory to treatment and recurrence is inevitable. Moreover, the biology of recurrent glioblastoma remains unclear. Increasing evidence has shown that intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapeutic resistance. However, the interaction between intracellular heterogeneity and drug resistance in recurrent GBMs remains controversial. The aim of this study was to map the transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in recurrent and drug-resistant GBMs at a single-cell resolution and further explore the mechanism of drug resistance of GBMs. We analyzed six tumor tissue samples from three patients with primary GBM and three patients with recurrent GBM in which recurrence and drug resistance developed after treatment with the standard Stupp protocol using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using unbiased clustering, nine major cell clusters were identified. Upregulation of the expression of stemness-related and cell-cycle-related genes was observed in recurrent GBM cells. Compared with the initial GBM tissues, recurrent GBM tissues showed a decreased proportion of microglia, consistent with previous reports. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and the blood-brain barrier permeability were high, and the O6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-related signaling pathway was activated in recurrent GBM. Our results delineate the single-cell map of recurrent glioblastoma, tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms, providing new insights into treatment strategies for recurrent glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36853018
"""Glioblastoma and brain connectivity: the need for a paradigm shift.""","""Despite substantial advances in cancer treatment, for patients with glioblastoma prognosis remains bleak. The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reveals intricate functional interplays between glioblastoma and the cellular architecture of the brain, encompassing neurons, glia, and vessels. New findings underscore the role of structural and functional connections within hierarchical networks, known as the connectome. These connections contribute to the location, spread, and recurrence of a glioblastoma, and a patient's overall survival, revealing a complex interplay between the tumour and the CNS. This mounting evidence prompts a paradigm shift, challenging the perception of glioblastomas as mere foreign bodies within the brain. Instead, these tumours are intricately woven into the structural and functional fabric of the brain. This radical change in thinking holds profound implications for the understanding and treatment of glioblastomas, which could unveil new prognostic factors and surgical strategies and optimise radiotherapy. Additionally, a connectivity approach suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation could disrupt pathological neuron-glioma interactions within specific networks.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38876751
"""Understanding glioblastoma at the single-cell level: Recent advances and future challenges.""","""Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38814900
"""Identification of hypoxic macrophages in glioblastoma: Unveiling therapeutic insights from tumour microenvironment analysis.""","""Tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs) exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in glioblastoma. Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic studies identified a monocyte-derived TAM subset localized in the peri-necrotic niche, driven by hypoxic cues to acquire ahypoxia response signature. These hypoxia-TAMs destabilize endothelial adherens junctions through adrenomedullin paracrine signaling, promoting the formation of hyperpermeable neovasculature that impedes drug delivery. Blocking adrenomedullin produced by hypoxia-TAMs restores vascular integrity, increases drug deliveryinto tumors, and provides combinatorial therapeutic benefits. Here we discuss the heterogeneity of TAMs regarding functional states and locations in glioblastomas, and propose future directions for studying the temporospatial dynamics of multifaceted TAM. HIGHLIGHTS: Single-cell omics reveal a functionally and spatially distinct hypoxia-TAM subset in glioblastoma. Adrenomedullin secreted by hypoxia-TAM destabilizes tumor vasculature and its blockade enhances vessel integrity and drug delivery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39297872
"""[Glioblastoma in 2017].""","""Glioblastomas are serious tumours of the central nervous system. Recurrence is systematic and prognosis poor. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy follow surgery, when surgery is possible, to lengthen survival, while preserving quality of life as much as possible. In this respect, symptomatic treatments and supportive care are necessary.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28160825
"""Single-cell characterization of macrophages in glioblastoma reveals MARCO as a mesenchymal pro-tumor marker.""","""Background: Macrophages are the most common infiltrating immune cells in gliomas and play a wide variety of pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. However, the different subpopulations of macrophages and their effects on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Methods: We combined new and previously published single-cell RNA-seq data from 98,015 single cells from a total of 66 gliomas to profile 19,331 individual macrophages. Results: Unsupervised clustering revealed a pro-tumor subpopulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages characterized by the scavenger receptor MARCO, which is almost exclusively found in IDH1-wild-type glioblastomas. Previous studies have implicated MARCO as an unfavorable marker in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; here, we find that bulk MARCO expression is associated with worse prognosis and mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, MARCO expression is significantly altered over the course of treatment with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors in a response-dependent manner, which we validate with immunofluorescence imaging. Conclusions: These findings illustrate a novel macrophage subpopulation that drives tumor progression in glioblastomas and suggest potential therapeutic targets to prevent their recruitment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34011400
"""Perioperative Management of Patients with Glioblastoma.""","""The clinical presentation of glioblastomas is varied, and definitive diagnosis requires pathologic examination and study of the tissue. Management of glioblastomas includes surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with surgery playing an important role in the prognosis of these patients. Awake craniotomy plays a crucial role in tumors in or adjacent to eloquent areas, allowing surgeons to maximize resection, while minimizing iatrogenic deficits. However, the prognosis remains dismal. This article presents the perioperative management of patients with glioblastoma including tools and surgical adjuncts to maximize extent of resection and minimize poor outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223018
"""Exosomes: Their role in the diagnosis, progression, metastasis, and treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Exosomes are crucial for the growth and spread of glioblastomas, an aggressive form of brain cancer. These tiny vesicles play a crucial role in the activation of signaling pathways and intercellular communication. They can also transfer a variety of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor to recipient cells. Exosomes can influence the immune response by regulating the activity of immune cells, and they are crucial for the growth and metastasis of glioblastoma cells. In addition, exosomes contribute to drug resistance during treatment, which is a major obstacle in the treatment of glioblastoma. By studying them, the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma can be improved. Due to their high biocompatibility and lack of toxicity, they have become an attractive option for drug delivery. The development of exosomes as carriers of specific therapeutic agents could overcome some of the obstacles to effective treatment of glioblastoma. In this review, we address the potential of exosomes for the treatment of glioblastoma and show how they can be modified for this purpose.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806071
"""Glioblastoma stem cells.""","""Glioblastomas are highly malignant primary brain tumors with one of the worst survival rates among all human cancers. With a more profound understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and acquired resistance to conventional radio- and chemotherapy, novel therapeutic targets might be discovered to optimize therapeutic approaches. In this regard, the identification of a small cellular subpopulation, called glioblastoma stem cell or stem-like cells or glioma-initiating cells or brain tumor propagating cells, has gained attention. In this article, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge about this tumor cell population and discuss future directions for basic and clinical research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21253762
"""Therapeutics and Research Related to Glioblastoma: Advancements and Future Targets.""","""Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has been recognized as one of the most lethal and fatal human tumors. It has a dismal prognosis, and survival after diagnosis is less than 15 months. Surgery and radiotherapy are the only available treatment options at present. However, numerous approaches have been made to upgrade in vivo and in vitro models with the primary goal of assessing abnormal molecular pathways that would be suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Novel drugs, delivery systems, and immunotherapy strategies to establish new multimodal therapies that target the molecular pathways involved in tumor initiation and progression in glioblastoma are being studied. The goal of this review was to describe the pathophysiology, neurodegeneration mechanisms, signaling pathways, and future therapeutic targets associated with glioblastomas. The key features have been detailed to provide an up-to-date summary of the advancement required in current diagnosis and therapeutics for glioblastoma. The role of nanoparticulate system graphene quantum dots as suitable therapy for glioblastoma has also been discussed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268863
"""Risk factors for glioblastoma are shared by other brain tumor types.""","""The reported risk factors for glioblastoma (GBM), i.e., ionizing radiation, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Neurofibromatosis I, and Turcot syndrome, also increase the risk of other brain tumor types. Risk factors for human GBM are associated with different oncogenic mutation profiles. Pedigreed domestic dogs with a shorter nose and flatter face (brachycephalic dogs) display relatively high rates of glioma formation. The genetic profiles of canine gliomas are also idiosyncratic. The association of putatively different mutational patterns in humans and canines with GBM suggests that different oncogenic pathways can result in GBM formation. Strong epidemiological evidence for an association between exposure to chemical carcinogens and an increased risk for development of GBM is currently lacking. Ionizing radiation induces point mutations, frameshift mutations, double-strand breaks, and chromosomal insertions or deletions. Mutational profiles associated with chemical exposures overlap with the broad mutational patterns seen with ionizing radiation. Weak statistical associations between chemical exposures and GBM reported in epidemiology studies are biologically plausible. Molecular approaches comparing reproducible patterns seen in spontaneous GBM with analogous patterns found in GBMs resected from patients with known significant exposures to potentially carcinogenic chemicals can address difficulties presented by traditional exposure assessment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520250
"""Management of Elderly Patients with Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose of review: Glioblastoma represents one of the major challenges in neurooncology and approximately half of the patients are 60 years or older. We summarize the particular situation of elderly glioblastoma patients with a focus on therapeutic considerations. Recent findings: Favorable molecular markers such as mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 genes are virtually absent in glioblastomas in elderly patients. Treatment options are similar to the situation in young patients and comprise surgical resection, radiation therapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. The performance status as well as comorbidities may have a stronger impact on the individual treatment decision than in young patients. The MGMT promoter methylation status allows for a stratification of treatment beyond the surgical intervention. In patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors, monotherapy with temozolomide is superior to radiotherapy alone. Similarly, the benefit conferred by combined temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone is largely restricted to patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors. At recurrence, no standard treatment has been established. The prognosis for elderly patients with glioblastoma remains poor. The MGMT promoter methylation status helps guiding treatment decisions and withholding inactive, but potentially harmful treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324304

"""Role of surgery in multifocal glioblastoma.""","""The management of multifocal glioblastomas is a point of constant discussion amongst neuro-oncologists. Best outcomes in glioblastoma management come from gross total resection (GTR) followed by concomitant radiation and chemotherapy (CCRT). Multifocal disease is resistant to GTR. Conventional management of these lesion is usually biopsy only followed by CCRT. Recent evidence has shown that there may be some benefit to attempting GTR of the largest lesion whenever safe to do so.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35320251
"""Optimizing glioblastoma resection: intraoperative mapping and beyond.""","""The management of glioblastomas starts with surgical resection if possible, along with subsequent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Several retrospective studies have suggested that extent of resection plays a role in the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. The importance of extent of resection must be balanced with preserving patient's functional status for tumors in eloquent areas. Here we review the preoperative imaging modalities such as functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the intraoperative techniques such as motor and language mapping, intraoperative MRI, and intraoperative techniques such as 5-aminolevulinic acid administration, that allow maximal safe operative resection of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25363008
"""Blood-brain barrier, cytotoxic chemotherapies and glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults. The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major limitation reducing efficacy of anti-cancer drugs in the treatment of GBM patients. Areas covered: Virtually all GBM recur after the first-line treatment, at least partly, due to invasive tumor cells protected from chemotherapeutic agents by the intact BBB in the brain adjacent to tumor. The passage through the BBB, taken by antitumor drugs, is poorly and heterogeneously documented in the literature. In this review, we have focused our attention on: (i) the BBB, (ii) the passage of chemotherapeutic agents across the BBB and (iii) the strategies investigated to overcome this barrier. Expert commentary: A better preclinical knowledge of the crossing of the BBB by antitumor drugs will allow optimizing their clinical development, alone or combined with BBB bypassing strategies, towards an increased success rate of clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27310463
"""Leveraging extrachromosomal DNA to fine-tune trials of targeted therapy for glioblastoma: opportunities and challenges.""","""Glioblastoma evolution is facilitated by intratumour heterogeneity, which poses a major hurdle to effective treatment. Evidence indicates a key role for oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in accelerating tumour evolution and thus resistance to treatment, particularly in glioblastomas. Oncogenes contained within ecDNA can reach high copy numbers and expression levels, and their unequal segregation can result in more rapid copy number changes in response to therapy than is possible through natural selection of intrachromosomal genomic loci. Notably, targeted therapies inhibiting oncogenic pathways have failed to improve glioblastoma outcomes. In this Perspective, we outline reasons for this disappointing lack of clinical translation and present the emerging evidence implicating ecDNA as an important driver of tumour evolution. Furthermore, we suggest that through detection of ecDNA, patient selection for clinical trials of novel agents can be optimized to include those most likely to benefit based on current understanding of resistance mechanisms. We discuss the challenges to successful translation of this approach, including accurate detection of ecDNA in tumour tissue with novel technologies, development of faithful preclinical models for predicting the efficacy of novel agents in the presence of ecDNA oncogenes, and understanding the mechanisms of ecDNA formation during cancer evolution and how they could be attenuated therapeutically. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of routine ecDNA characterization in the clinic and how this process could be integrated with other methods of molecular stratification to maximize the potential for clinical translation of precision medicines.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36131011

Median total dose, dose per fraction and equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) were 45.0 Gy, 3.0 Gy and 46.0 Gy, respectively. Median number of fractions was 15, median treatment time 3 weeks. Ten patients received temozolomide. Six factors were evaluated for survival including location of glioblastoma, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), gender, age, EQD2 and temozolomide. Results: KPS ≥60 showed a trend for improved survival (p=0.141). For other factors including EQD2, no significant association with survival was found.

"""Glioblastoma metastases: a literature review and a description of six clinical observations.""","""Introduction: since the 1990s, the literature has described cases of glioblastoma metastases with the development of foci located at a distance from the primary tumor. However, the pathogenesis of this process remains unclear until the end. This focus is believed to result, on the one hand, from tumor metastasis from the primary site and, on the other hand, from multifocal growth. This article presents a literature review and a description of clinical observations of patients with glioblastoma metastases. Material and methods: The study included 6 patients (1 female and 5 males) with brain glioblastomas who received treatment at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute (5 patients) and the Department of Neurosurgery of the Research Center of Neurology (1 patient) in the period from 2010 to 2014. Neurophysiological control was used if the tumor was localized near the eloquent cortical areas and pathways; 4 of 6 patients were operated on using the methods of intraoperative fluorescence diagnosis (5-ALA agent--Alasens). Results: Four patients had metastases within one hemisphere, two had metastases in the contralateral hemisphere in the period of 5 to 18 months after the first operation. The primary tumor site was located near the ventricular system in two patients. In one patient, the lateral ventricle was opened during the first operation. In another patient, the prepontine cistern was opened during the first operation. In two patients, the primary tumor site was located at a distance from the lateral ventricles, however, the tumor was located near them during recurrence. Based on metabolic navigation, fluorescence of the tumor was observed in the four patients during both the first and repeated operations. Conclusions: The close relationship between primary glioblastomas and metastases and the cerebrospinal fluid circulation pathways may confirm the fact of dissemination of tumor cells with cerebrospinal fluid flow. In our opinion, there should be an increased suspicion of the possibility for metastases of glioblastomas that are closely associated with the cerebrospinal fluid circulation pathways. Metabolic navigation with 5-ALA is effective both during primary surgery in patients with glioblastomas and during resection of glioblastoma metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26146042
"""Temporal change of DNA methylation subclasses between matched newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.""","""The longitudinal transition of phenotypes is pivotal in glioblastoma treatment resistance and DNA methylation emerged as an important tool for classifying glioblastoma phenotypes. We aimed to characterize DNA methylation subclass heterogeneity during progression and assess its clinical impact. Matched tissues from 47 glioblastoma patients were subjected to DNA methylation profiling, including CpG-site alterations, tissue and serum deconvolution, mass spectrometry, and immunoassay. Effects of clinical characteristics on temporal changes and outcomes were studied. Among 47 patients, 8 (17.0%) had non-matching classifications at recurrence. In the remaining 39 cases, 28.2% showed dominant DNA methylation subclass transitions, with 72.7% being a mesenchymal subclass. In general, glioblastomas with a subclass transition showed upregulated metabolic processes. Newly diagnosed glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition displayed increased stem cell-like states and decreased immune components at diagnosis and exhibited elevated immune signatures and cytokine levels in serum. In contrast, tissue of recurrent glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition showed increased immune components but decreased stem cell-like states. Survival analyses revealed comparable outcomes for patients with and without subclass transitions. This study demonstrates a temporal heterogeneity of DNA methylation subclasses in 28.2% of glioblastomas, not impacting patient survival. Changes in cell state composition associated with subclass transition may be crucial for recurrent glioblastoma targeted therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38244080
"""Therapeutic strategies targeting glioblastoma stem cells.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common, aggressive and lethal brain tumor in adults. However, current therapeutic protocols have low success rates and average overall survival is less than 15 months. The resistance to therapy is largely a result of the remarkable cellular and phenotypical heterogeneity that characterizes this type of tumor. The discovery of a subpopulation of cells exhibiting stem cell properties within the tumor bulk has profound implications for therapy as increasing evidence indicates that these cells, glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), are responsible for the origin, maintenance and recurrence of the glioblastomas. These findings highlight the need to characterize GSCs in order to find novel treatments directly targeted specifically against them.

"""Differentiating brain metastasis from glioblastoma by time-dependent diffusion MRI.""","""Background: This study was designed to investigate the use of time-dependent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in distinguishing between glioblastomas and brain metastases. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted involving 65 patients with glioblastomas and 27 patients with metastases using a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence with oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE, 50 Hz) and a conventional pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE, 0 Hz) sequence. In addition to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from two sequences (ADC50Hz and ADC0Hz), we generated maps of the ADC change (cADC): ADC50Hz - ADC0Hz and the relative ADC change (rcADC): (ADC50Hz - ADC0Hz)/ ADC0Hz × 100 (%). Results: The mean and the fifth and 95th percentile values of each parameter in enhancing and peritumoral regions were compared between glioblastomas and metastases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the best discriminating indices were compared. In enhancing regions, none of the indices of ADC0Hz and ADC50Hz showed significant differences between metastases and glioblastomas. The mean cADC and rcADC values of metastases were significantly higher than those of glioblastomas (0.24 ± 0.12 × 10-3mm2/s vs. 0.14 ± 0.03 × 10-3mm2/s and 23.3 ± 9.4% vs. 14.0 ± 4.7%; all p < 0.01). In peritumoral regions, no significant difference in all ADC indices was observed between metastases and glioblastomas. The AUC values for the mean cADC (0.877) and rcADC (0.819) values in enhancing regions were significantly higher than those for ADC0Hz5th (0.595; all p < 0.001). Conclusions: The time-dependent diffusion MRI parameters may be useful for differentiating brain metastases from glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37553578
"""Molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its clinical relevance.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common intracranial malignancy and constitutes about 50 % of all gliomas. Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor histological heterogeneity had been recognized by the early 1980-ies. Recent works using novel molecular platforms provided molecular definitions of these tumors. Based on comprehensive genomic sequence analyses, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) cataloged somatic mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in glioblastoma. Robust transcriptome and epigenome studies also revealed inter-tumor heterogeneity. Integration and cluster analyses of multi-dimensional genomic data lead to a new classification of glioblastoma tumors into subtypes with distinct biological features and clinical correlates. However, multiple observations also revealed tumor area-specific patterns of genomic imbalance. In addition, genetic alterations have been identified that were common to all areas analyzed and other alterations that were area specific. Analyses of intra-tumor transcriptome variations revealed that in more than half of the examined cases, fragments from the same tumor mass could be classified into at least two different glioblastoma molecular subgroups. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of molecular genetic profiles in glioblastoma may explain the difficulties encountered in the validation of oncologic biomarkers, and contribute to a biased selection of patients for single target therapies, treatment failure or drug resistance. In this paper, we summarize the currently available literature concerning inter- and intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas, and call attention to the importance of this topic in relation to the growing efforts in routine molecular diagnostics and personalized therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156108
"""Mitochondrial energy metabolism and apoptosis regulation in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of gliomas and is associated with short survival. Recent advancements in molecular genetics resulted in the identification of glioma genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic hallmarks, and multidimensional data allowed clustering of glioblastomas into molecular subtypes. Parallel with these developments, much scientific attention has been attracted by the exploration of two functional processes linked to mitochondrial regulation. One of these processes involves genomic and mitochondrial gene mutations, mitochondrial protein expression modifications and altered metabolic regulation that define glioblastoma. The second mitochondrially-centered process involves complex molecular interactions and pathways that influence the extrinsic or the intrinsic mechanisms of apoptosis regulation and may underlie the uncontrolled spreading, recurrence and drug resistance of glioblastoma. While the available data are not yet comprehensive, these two complex processes represent important aspects of tumor cell biology, which may provide complementary opportunities for therapeutic manipulations of this highly resistant tumor type.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451120
"""The potential of advanced MR techniques for precision radiotherapy of glioblastoma.""","""As microscopic tumour infiltration of glioblastomas is not visible on conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, an isotropic expansion of 1-2 cm around the visible tumour is applied to define the clinical target volume for radiotherapy. An opportunity to visualize microscopic infiltration arises with advanced MR imaging. In this review, various advanced MR biomarkers are explored that could improve target volume delineation for radiotherapy of glioblastomas. Various physiological processes in glioblastomas can be visualized with different advanced MR techniques. Combining maps of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), vessel size imaging (VSI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or amide proton transfer (APT) can provide early information on tumour infiltration and high-risk regions of future recurrence. Oxygen consumption is increased 6 months prior to tumour progression being visible on conventional MR imaging. However, presence of the Warburg effect, marking a switch from an infiltrative to a proliferative phenotype, could result in CMRO2 to appear unaltered in high-risk regions. Including information on biomarkers representing angiogenesis (rCBV and VSI) and hypercellularity (ADC) or protein concentration (APT) can omit misinterpretation due to the Warburg effect. Future research should evaluate these biomarkers in radiotherapy planning to explore the potential of advanced MR techniques to personalize target volume delineation with the aim to improve local tumour control and/or reduce radiation-induced toxicity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35129718

Efforts are ongoing to target newer molecules that could be used for drug development. This review provides up-to-date information on the drugs and their molecular targets, which are currently in different stages of clinical trials.

"""GZ17-6.02 Inhibits the Growth of EGFRvIII+ Glioblastoma.""","""Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is amplified in over 50% of glioblastomas and promotes tumor formation and progression. However, attempts to treat glioblastoma with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been unsuccessful thus far. The current standard of care is especially poor in patients with a constitutively active form of EGFR, EGFRvIII, which is associated with shorter survival time. This study examined the effect of GZ17-6.02, a novel anti-cancer agent undergoing phase 1 studies, on two EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma stem cells: D10-0171 and D317. In vitro analyses showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibited the growth of both D10-0171 and D317 cells with IC50 values of 24.84 and 28.28 µg/mL respectively. RNA sequencing and reverse phase protein array analyses revealed that GZ17-6.02 downregulates pathways primarily related to steroid synthesis and cell cycle progression. Interestingly, G17-6.02's mechanism of action involves the downregulation of the recently identified glioblastoma super-enhancer genes WSCD1, EVOL2, and KLHDC8A. Finally, a subcutaneous xenograft model showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibits glioblastoma growth in vivo. We conclude that GZ17-6.02 is a promising combination drug effective at inhibiting the growth of a subset of glioblastomas and our data warrants further preclinical studies utilizing xenograft models to identify patients that may respond to this drug.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456993
"""Current insights on extracellular vesicle-mediated glioblastoma progression: Implications in drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most fatal tumors of the central nervous system with high rate of disease progression, diagnosis, prognosis and low survival rate. Therapeutic approaches that relied on surgical resection and chemotherapy have been unable to curb the disease progression and subsequently leading to increase in incidences of GBM reoccurrence. Scope of the review: In the recent times, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been observed as one of the key reasons for the uncontrolled growth of GBM. EVs are shown to have the potential to contribute to the disease progression via mediating drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The GBM-derived EVs (GDEVs) with its cargo contents act as the biological trojan horse and lead to disease progression after being received by the recipient target cells. This review article highlights the biophysical, biochemical properties of EVs, its cargo contents and its potential role in the growth and progression of GBM by altering tumour microenvironment. Major conclusions: EVs are being explored for serving as novel disease biomarkers in a variety of cancer types such as adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, color rectal cancer, gliomas and glioblastomas. Improvement in the EV isolation protocols, polymer-based separation techniques and transcriptomics, have made EVs a key diagnostic marker to unravel the progression and early GBM diagnosis. GDEVs role in tumour progression is under extensive investigations. General significance: Attempts have been also made to discuss and compare the usage of EVs as potential therapeutic targets versus existing therapies targeting drug resistance and EMT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902452
"""Pharmacometabolomics Informs Quantitative Radiomics for Glioblastoma Diagnostic Innovation.""","""Applications of omics systems biology technologies have enormous promise for radiology and diagnostics in surgical fields. In this context, the emerging fields of radiomics (a systems scale approach to radiology using a host of technologies, including omics) and pharmacometabolomics (use of metabolomics for patient and disease stratification and guiding precision medicine) offer much synergy for diagnostic innovation in surgery, particularly in neurosurgery. This synthesis of omics fields and applications is timely because diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors still challenges decision-making. Considering the vast heterogeneity in brain tumors, disease phenotypes, and interindividual variability in surgical and chemotherapy outcomes, we believe that diagnostic accuracy can be markedly improved by quantitative radiomics coupled to pharmacometabolomics and related health information technologies while optimizing economic costs of traditional diagnostics. In this expert review, we present an innovation analysis on a systems-level multi-omics approach toward diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors. For this, we suggest that glioblastomas serve as a useful application paradigm. We performed a literature search on PubMed for articles published in English between 2006 and 2016. We used the search terms 'radiomics,' 'glioblastoma,' 'biomarkers,' 'pharmacogenomics,' 'pharmacometabolomics,' 'pharmacometabonomics/pharmacometabolomics,' 'collaborative informatics,' and 'precision medicine.' A list of the top 4 insights we derived from this literature analysis is presented in this study. For example, we found that (i) tumor grading needs to be better refined, (ii) diagnostic precision should be improved, (iii) standardization in radiomics is lacking, and (iv) quantitative radiomics needs to prove clinical implementation. We conclude with an interdisciplinary call to the metabolomics, pharmacy/pharmacology, radiology, and surgery communities that pharmacometabolomics coupled to information technologies (chemoinformatics tools, databases, collaborative systems) can inform quantitative radiomics, thus translating Big Data and information growth to knowledge growth, rational drug development and diagnostics innovation for glioblastomas, and possibly in other brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28816643
"""A peculiar case of pure intraventricular glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (formerly named glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common primary central nervous system tumor, representing 45% of all cases and 15% of all intracranial neoplasms [1]. Its typical radiologic findings and localization make it often a lesion easy to diagnose. In MRI it usually appears as an irregularly shaped cystic lesion with ring contrast enhancement in T1-weighted images, localized in subcortical white matter and deep gray matter nuclei of the cerebral hemispheres. It involves more frequently the frontotemporal region followed by parietal lobes [1]. Few articles in literature described cases of intraventricular glioblastomas, defining those as secondary ventricular tumors because of their probable origin primarily from cerebral tissue with consequent transependymal development [2, 3]. Atypical presentations of these tumors make it more difficult to clearly differentiate them from other lesions more commonly located in the ventricular system. We describe a case with a unique radiological presentation: an intraventricular glioblastoma lying entirely within the ventricular walls, involving all the ventricular system, without mass effect or nodular parenchymal lesions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37382731
"""Surgical management and outcome of newly diagnosed glioblastoma without contrast enhancement (low-grade appearance): a report of the RANO resect group.""","""Background: Resection of the contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor represents the standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. However, some tumors ultimately diagnosed as glioblastoma lack contrast enhancement and have a 'low-grade appearance' on imaging (non-CE glioblastoma). We aimed to (a) volumetrically define the value of non-CE tumor resection in the absence of contrast enhancement, and to (b) delineate outcome differences between glioblastoma patients with and without contrast enhancement. Methods: The RANO resect group retrospectively compiled a global, eight-center cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma per WHO 2021 classification. The associations between postoperative tumor volumes and outcome were analyzed. Propensity score-matched analyses were constructed to compare glioblastomas with and without contrast enhancement. Results: Among 1323 newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, we identified 98 patients (7.4%) without contrast enhancement. In such patients, smaller postoperative tumor volumes were associated with more favorable outcome. There was an exponential increase in risk for death with larger residual non-CE tumor. Accordingly, extensive resection was associated with improved survival compared to lesion biopsy. These findings were retained on a multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic and clinical markers. Compared to CE glioblastoma, patients with non-CE glioblastoma had a more favorable clinical profile and superior outcome as confirmed in propensity score analyses by matching the patients with non-CE glioblastoma to patients with CE glioblastoma using a large set of clinical variables. Conclusions: The absence of contrast enhancement characterizes a less aggressive clinical phenotype of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Maximal resection of non-CE tumors has prognostic implications and translates into favorable outcome.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665776
"""Cytomegalovirus and glioblastoma: a review of evidence for their association and indications for testing and treatment.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and most fatal primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Despite progress in characterizing the genetic and molecular mechanisms of glioblastomas, advances in treatment that translate into substantial improvement in prognosis have yet to be realized. A role for cytomegalovirus in glioblastoma pathogenesis was proposed more than a decade ago and has generated considerable debate as a possible therapeutic target. Independent groups have had variable success in detecting cytomegalovirus infection in tumor cells; the overall consensus is that very low levels of viral proteins and nucleic acids can be observed. Although cytomegalovirus has not been found to be oncogenic in this context, a possible oncomodulatory role has been suggested. A recent clinical trial evaluating valganciclovir as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on tumor growth or overall survival, although retrospective analysis subsequently indicted a significant survival benefit. In light of the publicity of that report, patients and neuro-oncologists are requesting cytomegalovirus testing to justify antiviral treatment. Based on questions on the significance of cytomegalovirus infection in glioblastomas and the lack of a clear clinical benefit of valganciclovir, we reviewed this topic and conclude that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing and treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25289896
"""Glioblastoma Molecular Classification Tool Based on mRNA Analysis: From Wet-Lab to Subtype.""","""Most glioblastoma studies incorporate the layer of tumor molecular subtype based on the four-subtype classification system proposed in 2010. Nevertheless, there is no universally recognized and convenient tool for glioblastoma molecular subtyping, and each study applies a different set of markers and/or approaches that cause inconsistencies in data comparability and reproducibility between studies. Thus, this study aimed to create an applicable user-friendly tool for glioblastoma classification, with high accuracy, while using a significantly smaller number of variables. The study incorporated a TCGA microarray, sequencing datasets, and an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas (LUHS cohort). The models were constructed by applying the Agilent G4502 dataset, and they were tested using the Affymetrix HG-U133a and Illumina Hiseq cohorts, as well as the LUHS cases. Two classification models were constructed by applying a logistic regression classification algorithm, based on the mRNA levels of twenty selected genes. The classifiers were translated to a RT-qPCR assay and validated in an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas. The classification accuracy of the 20-gene and 5-gene classifiers varied between 90.7-91% and 85.9-87.7%, respectively. With this work, we propose a cost-efficient three-class (classical, mesenchymal, and proneural) tool for glioblastoma molecular classification based on the mRNA analysis of only 5-20 genes, and we provide the basic information for classification performance starting from the wet-lab stage. We hope that the proposed classification tool will enable data comparability between different research groups.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36555518
"""Insular glioblastoma: surgical challenges, survival outcomes and prognostic factors.""","""Background: Insular gliomas are unique, challenging and evoke a lot of interest amongst neurosurgeons. Publications on insular glioma generally focus on the surgical intricacies and extent of resection pertaining to the low-grade gliomas. Insular glioblastomas (iGBM) have not been analysed separately before. Methods: Histologically proven WHO grade IV gliomas involving the insula over a 9-year period were studied. Their clinical presentation, radiological features, surgical findings and survival outcomes were assessed. Statistical methods were used to determine the favourable predictors of survival. Results: Out of 27 patients (M:F = 2.9:1), 18 (66%) patients had a tumour extension beyond the insula, 10 (37%) of whom had basal ganglia involvement. Total, near total and subtotal excisions were performed in 7 (26%), 9 (33%) and 11 (40.7%) patients, respectively. Twenty-three patients had glioblastoma, while four had gliosarcoma. IDH mutation was negative in six of the seven patients where it was done. Median overall survival was 5 months. Multivariate analysis showed that a female gender (p = 0.013), seizures in the preoperative period (p = 0.048) and completion of adjuvant therapy (p = 0.003) were associated with a longer survival. Conclusion: Insular glioblastomas have a poor prognosis. Insular location and certain tumour characteristics often limit the extent of resection of iGBMs. Moreover, postoperative complications sometimes negate the advantages of a radical resection. A female gender, presentation with seizures and completion of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy appear to be good prognostic factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356607
"""Individualized targeted therapy for glioblastoma: fact or fiction?""","""Purpose: This review will address the current state of individualized cancer therapy for glioblastoma. Glioblastomas are highly malignant primary brain tumors presumably originating from neuroglial progenitor cells. Median survival is less than 1 year. Design: Recent developments in the morphologic, clinical, and molecular classification of glioblastoma were reviewed, and their impact on clinical decision making was analyzed. Results: Glioblastomas can be classified by morphology, clinical characteristics, complex molecular signatures, single biomarkers, or imaging parameters. Some of these characteristics, including age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score, provide important prognostic information. In contrast, few markers help to choose between various treatment options. Promoter methylation of the O-methylguanine methyltransferase gene seems to predict benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy. Hence, it is used as an entry criterion for alkylator-free experimental combination therapy with radiotherapy. Screening for a specific type of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is currently being explored as a biomarker for selecting patients for vaccination. Positron emission tomography for the detection of ανβ3/5 integrins could be used to select patients for treatment with anti-integrin antiangiogenic approaches. Discussion: Despite extensive efforts at defining biological markers as a basis for selecting therapies, most treatment decisions for glioblastoma patients are still based on age and performance status. However, several ongoing clinical trials may enrich the repertoire of criteria for clinical decision making in the very near future. The concept of individualized or personalized targeted cancer therapy has gained significant attention throughout oncology. Yet, data in support of such an approach to glioblastoma, the most malignant subtype of glioma, are limited, and personalized medicine plays a minor role in current clinical neuro-oncology practice. In essence, this concept proposes that tumors that are currently lumped together based on common morphologic features can be subclassified in a way that the resulting subentities are more homogeneous, for example, in molecular signatures and will therefore be amenable to selective therapeutic interventions. At present, the major 'biomarkers' used to allocate treatment in glioblastoma are age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and these markers have so far survived all efforts at more sophisticated approaches to the management of this disease. Treatment allocation basically means intensity of treatment, especially the use of the standard-of-care or radiotherapy alone beyond age 65 to 70 years or below a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of 60.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290256

Results: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging usually revealed a large lesion with minimal edema, heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and a discrete border. Subtotal tumor resection was performed in two patients and gross total resection in three patients. Immunostaining of the tumor cells with antisera to glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin was variably positive. Adjuvant therapy included local radiation and chemotherapy in all followed patients. Tumor recurrence was seen in two patients. Patients were followed from 2 months to 3.5 years (mean, 12 months). Two patients were dead at last follow-up with a mean survival of 9.5 months. Conclusions: The prognosis for pediatric patients with cerebellar glioblastomas is dismal, even when compared to adult counterparts or other malignant posterior fossa tumors in children. Cerebellar glioblastomas have a tendency to recur and disseminate despite treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The poor outcomes seen with this tumor suggest that the optimal treatment strategy has yet to be elucidated and much work needs to be done.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23299302

"""Molecular mechanisms of necrosis in glioblastoma: the role of glutamate excitotoxicity.""","""Glioblastomas continue to rank among the most lethal primary human tumors. Despite treatment with the most rigorous surgical interventions along with the most optimal chemotherapeutic and radiation regimens, the median survival is just 12-15 mo for patients with glioblastoma. Among the histological hallmarks of glioblastoma, necrosis has been demonstrated to be a powerful predictor of poor patient prognosis. Over the years, there have been many advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma formation, yet the mechanisms that lead to tumor necrosis remain unclear. One pathway that may lead to necrosis in glioblastoma involves the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which has been shown to accumulate in the peritumoral fluid as a result of decreased cellular uptake by glioblastoma cells. This accumulation leads to subsequent glutamate excitotoxicity and probable necrosis through a massive elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and reduction in cellular ATP levels. We propose that a pathway involving tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) leads to decreased glutamate uptake through coordinated downregulation of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), the glutamate transporter responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the human brain. In addition, we suggest that AEG-1 signaling, loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and ionotropic glutamate receptor activity lead to AKT pathway activation, which results in nutrient overconsumption and necrosis. Together, these pathways provide a new perspective on glioblastoma necrosis involving the process of glutamate excitotoxicity. Future research should address the components of these molecular pathways in order to better understand the mechanism of necrosis in glioblastoma and to begin to develop targeted therapies that may improve patient prognosis in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19770591

More recently, the progress from single gene to whole-genome analysis of DNA methylation has allowed a better subclassification of glioblastomas. Here, we review the clinically relevant information that can be obtained by studying MGMT gene and whole-genome DNA methylation changes in glioblastomas, also highlighting benefits, including those of liquid biopsy, and pitfalls of the different detection methods.

Primary outcome parameters were extent of resection (EOR) using the 2021 RANO criteria, progression free- and overall survival. Results: A total of 483 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (CNS WHO grade 4) were assessed. 134 patients presented with ML (72 multifocal (MF), 62 multicentric (MC)). The median PFS and OS did not differ among MC and MF glioblastomas. The EOR was a significant predictor of PFS and OS in ML glioblastoma. complete-, near total-, and subtotal resection significantly prolonged PFS (p < 0.0001) and OS (p < 0.0001) compared to biopsy alone. Standard radiotherapy (p = 0.045) and hypofractionated (p < 0.0001) radiotherapy and adjuvant treatment (Stupp protocol) prolonged PFS (p = 0.0012) and OS (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis Karnfosky performance score, EOR, and concomitant adjuvant treatment remained significant factors influencing OS. Propensity score matching of patients with ML and solitary lesion tumors showed similar PFS and OS (p = 0.08).

In glioblastoma it is associated with a poor prognosis and more extensive infiltrative phenotype. CXCR4 can be targeted by the diagnostic PET agent [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor and its therapeutic counterpart [177Lu]Lu-Pentixather. We aimed to investigate the expression of CXCR4 in glioblastoma tissue to further examine the potential of these PET agents. Methods: CXCR4 mRNA expression was examined using the R2 genomics platform. Glioblastoma tissue cores were stained for CXCR4. CXCR4 staining in tumor cells was scored. Stained tissue components (cytoplasm and/or nuclei of the tumor cells and blood vessels) were documented. Clinical characteristics and information on IDH and MGMT promoter methylation status were collected. Seven pilot patients with recurrent glioblastoma underwent [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET; residual resected tissue was stained for CXCR4. Results: Two large mRNA datasets (N = 284; N = 540) were assesed. Of the 191 glioblastomas, 426 cores were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Seventy-eight cores (23 tumors) were CXCR4 negative, while 18 cores (5 tumors) had both strong and extensive staining. The remaining 330 cores (163 tumors) showed a large inter- and intra-tumor variation for CXCR4 expression; also seen in the resected tissue of the seven pilot patients-not directly translatable to [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET results. Both mRNA and immunohistochemical analysis showed CXCR4 negative normal brain tissue and no significant correlation between CXCR4 expression and IDH or MGMT status or survival. Conclusion: Using immunohistochemistry, high CXCR4 expression was found in a subset of glioblastomas as well as a large inter- and intra-tumor variation. Caution should be exercised in directly translating ex vivo CXCR4 expression to PET agent uptake. However, when high CXCR4 expression can be identified with [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor, these patients might be good candidates for targeted radionuclide therapy with [177Lu]Lu-Pentixather in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33550492

PETs were performed at 0H, 48H, 168H, 240H, and 336H post-injection. Tumor induction was confirmed using [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and immunohistochemistry. Radiotracer uptake was estimated in all pre-defined Volumes-of-Interest. Results: Anti-VEGF mAbs showed 100 % Radiochemical-Purity. [89Zr]-DFO-bevacizumab showed a significantly higher bioavailability in whole-blood. A significant increase in the tumor uptake was detectable at 168H PET with [89Zr]-DFO-bevacizumab meanwhile with [89Zr]-DFO-aflibercept it was only detectable at 336H. [89Zr]-DFO-bevacizumab tumor uptake was significantly higher than that of [89Zr]-DFO-aflibercept in all the scans. Tumor induction was confirmed in all animal models. Conclusion: MAbs detect VEGF-expression in glioblastoma models. Tumors were earlier targeted by Bevacizumab. The lower blood availability of aflibercept resulted in a lower tumor uptake than bevacizumab in all the scans.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38224761

Recent preclinical and clinical investigations have revealed that agents targeting angiogenesis may have efficacy against this type of tumor. Antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor are being studied in this patient population. Unfortunately, treatment inevitably fails. This review provides an update on recent research on the mechanisms by which tumor cells acquire resistance, and discusses recent preclinical and experimental development of novel new-generation anti-angiogenic agents that overcome this problem, especially those based on the molecular mechanisms of tumor vessel formation. The tumor vasculature not only nourishes glioblastomas, but also provides a specialized microenvironment for tumor stem-like cells and for the brain tumor.

Patient-derived models, such as organoids and explants, have recently emerged as useful models to study such heterogeneity, although the extent to which they can recapitulate GBM genomic features remains unclear. Here, we analyze bulk exome and single-cell genome and transcriptome profiles of 12 IDH wild-type GBMs, including two recurrent tumors, and of patient-derived explants (PDEs) and gliomasphere (GS) lines derived from these tumors. We find that PDEs are genetically similar to, and variably retain gene expression characteristics of, their parent tumors. Notably, PDEs appear to exhibit similar levels of transcriptional heterogeneity compared with their parent tumors, whereas GS lines tend to be enriched for cells in a more uniform transcriptional state.

"""EGFR-dependent mechanisms in glioblastoma: towards a better therapeutic strategy.""","""Glioblastoma is a particularly resilient cancer, and while therapies may be able to reach the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier, they then have to deal with a highly invasive tumor that is very resistant to DNA damage. It seems clear that in order to kill aggressive glioma cells more efficiently and with fewer side effects on normal tissue, there must be a shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. Since the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in almost 50% of glioblastomas, it currently represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets. In fact, it has been associated with several distinct steps in tumorigenesis, from tumor initiation to tumor growth and survival, and also with the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. However, inhibitors of the EGFR kinase have produced poor results with this type of cancer in clinical trials, with no clear explanation for the tumor resistance observed. Here we will review what we know about the expression and function of EGFR in cancer and in particular in gliomas. We will also evaluate which are the possible molecular and cellular escape mechanisms. As a result, we hope that this review will help improve the design of future EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24671641

We review key concepts and mechanisms relevant to EGFR-targeted treatment resistance at a systems level.

Different anti-angiogenic strategies have been developed: inhibition of pro-angiogenic factors and/or receptors and/or downstream cell signaling, inactivation of endothelial cells, inhibition of cellular adhesion molecules and/or extracellular matrix remodeling. Inhibitors of angiogenesis are separated into endogenous inhibitors such as angiostatin, trombospondin or alpha interferon and natural or synthetic inhibitors such as thalidomide, antibodies against angiogenic growth factors or inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors.

"""Vascular heterogeneity and targeting: the role of YKL-40 in glioblastoma vascularization.""","""Malignant glioblastomas (GBM) are highly malignant brain tumors that have extensive and aberrant tumor vasculature, including multiple types of vessels. This review focuses on recent discoveries that the angiogenic factor YKL-40 (CHI3L1) acts on glioblastoma-stem like cells (GSCs) to drive the formation of two major forms of tumor vascularization: angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). GSCs possess multipotent cells able to transdifferentiate into vascular pericytes or smooth muscle cells (PC/SMCs) that either coordinate with endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate angiogenesis or assemble in the absence of ECs to form blood-perfused channels via VM. GBMs express high levels of YKL-40 that drives the divergent signaling cascades to mediate the formation of these distinct microvascular circulations. Although a variety of anti-tumor agents that target angiogenesis have demonstrated transient benefits for patients, they often fail to restrict tumor growth, which underscores the need for additional therapeutic tools. We propose that targeting YKL-40 may compliment conventional anti-angiogenic therapies to provide a substantial clinical benefit to patients with GBM and several other types of solid tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26439689

"""Antiangiogenesis treatment for glioblastoma multiforme: challenges and opportunities.""","""Angiogenesis is a major hallmark of cancer cells, and glioblastomas are among the most angiogenic tumors. The cascade of angiogenesis is probably initiated by hypoxia, leading to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Both VEGF and bFGF have paracrine effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, or both, causing the formation of hyperpermeable tumor blood vessels. Advanced MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced, dynamic susceptibility, and arterial spin labeling MRI, have provided semiquantitative measurements of tumor vascular permeability and perfusion. A decrease in vascular permeability and perfusion can be detected after antiangiogenesis drug treatment, either with monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab that sequesters VEGF, or small-molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, antiangiogenesis therapies are being increasingly adopted for treating glioblastomas. However, caution must be exercised because neural stem cells are also sensitive to antiangiogenesis drugs and the combined effect of ionizing radiation.

"""Role of microRNAs in mechanisms of glioblastoma resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.""","""Low-grade gliomas and multiform glioblastoma are characterized by highly pronounced anaplasia, malignization, proliferation, and invasiveness; moreover, they are highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. The very low efficiency of traditional approaches in the treatment of patients with glioblastomas is due to the intensive invasive growth of the tumor resulting in deep infiltration of adjacent normal perivascular and nervous tissue and formation of areas of perineural infiltration differently remote from the tumor epicenter. MicroRNAs are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene activities, and their expression is markedly increased in tumors, in particular in gliomas. MicroRNAs have been shown to promote the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of tumor stem and non-stem cells. However, a population of microRNA possessing antitumor effects is also detected in gliomas. As a rule, the expression of antitumor microRNAs is suppressed in tumors. In this review, we consider microRNAs, their influence on radio- and chemoresistance of gliomas, and prospects for their use as specific agents in targeted therapy of gliomas. The pool of these microRNAs has distinct therapeutic value, because on use in combined therapy it can decrease the resistance of glioma tumor stem cells to existing pharmaceuticals and improve the efficiency of radio- and chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23590435

Methods: We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. Results: When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered.

"""Potential therapeutic implications of cancer stem cells in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor. Despite recent therapeutic advances in other cancers, the treatment of glioblastomas remains ineffective and essentially palliative. The treatment failure is a result of a number of causes, but we and others have demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) display relative resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs also contribute to tumor growth through the stimulation of angiogenesis, which has been shown to be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas. Cancer stem cells also have been hypothesized as a contributor to systemic metastases. While glioblastomas rarely metastasize beyond the central nervous system, glioblastomas invade into brain structures to prevent surgical cure and GSCs have an extremely invasive phenotype. Collectively, these studies and others suggest that GSCs may be important therapeutic targets not only to achieve cure but even reduce tumor relapse and improve overall survival. Many recent studies suggest that GSCs share core regulatory pathways with normal embryonic and somatic stem cells, but display important distinctions that provide clues into useful treatment targets. The cancer stem cell hypothesis may also modify our approaches in tumor imaging and biomarker development, but clinical validation waits.

"""A Syx-RhoA-Dia1 signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive tumors that lack effective treatments. Here, we show that the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx promotes GBM cell growth both in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts derived from patients with GBM. Growth defects upon Syx depletion are attributed to prolonged mitosis, increased DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis, mediated by altered mRNA and protein expression of various cell cycle regulators. These effects are phenocopied by depletion of the Rho downstream effector Dia1 and are due, at least in part, to increased phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and reduced activity of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. Furthermore, targeting Syx signaling cooperates with radiation treatment and temozolomide (TMZ) to decrease viability in GBM cells, irrespective of their inherent response to TMZ. The data indicate that a Syx-RhoA-Dia1-YAP/TAZ signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in GBM and argue for its targeting for cancer treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427593

Temozolomide mechanism of action is complex and we have recently evidenced a temozolomide-associated anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo on preclinical human glioblastoma models. We describe in the current review the temozolomide-associated antiangiogenic activity. We also describe here the major signaling pathways that can be constitutively activated in migrating glioma cells, and which render these cells resistant to proapoptotic insults such as conventional chemotherapies. In light of this resistance, we therefore describe the targeted therapies and local drug delivery systems which could be used to complement conventional treatments.

At the time of death, 3 patients had apparent tumor control at their primary site. We evaluated DNA from both primary and metastatic glioblastomas for genetic alterations commonly found in glioblastomas: TP53 mutations, CDKN2A/p16 deletions, EGFR amplification, and allelic loss of chromosomes 1p, 10q and 19q. Four of 6 cases had TP53 mutations and only single cases had EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/p16 deletions, or allelic loss of 1p, 10q and 19q; 2 cases had no detectable genetic alterations. In 2 cases, the primary and metastatic tumors had identical genotypes. Remarkably, however, 2 cases had different TP53 alterations in the primary and metastatic lesions, or among the metastatic tumors, which suggests that some metastatic deposits may represent emergence of subclones that were not necessarily dominant in the primary tumor. The present observations and a review of the recent literature demonstrate that metastatic glioblastomas tend to occur in younger adults who do not follow long clinical courses, and may be characterized by TP53 mutations and differential clonal selection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11138924

As in other solid tumors, populations of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) endowed with tumor initiating and therapeutic resistance properties have been identified.

In one direction, endothelial cells and their secreted proteins are able to sustain GSC properties while, in turn, GSCs can promote neoangiogenesis, modulate endothelial cell functions and may even transdifferentiate into endothelial cells.

Sequential preoperative examinations using fluorine-18-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) could depict the degree of glucose metabolism with hypoxic condition. However, molecular mechanism of glucose metabolism under hypoxia in glioblastoma has been unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the key molecules of hypoxic glucose metabolism. Methods: Using surgically obtained specimens, gene expressions associated with glucose metabolism were analyzed in patients with glioblastoma (n = 33) who underwent preoperative 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG PET to identify affected molecules according to hypoxic condition. Tumor in vivo metabolic activities were semiquantitatively evaluated by lesion-normal tissue ratio (LNR). Protein expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. To evaluate prognostic value, relationship between gene expression and overall survival was explored in another independent nonoverlapping clinical cohort (n = 17) and validated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (n = 167). Results: Among the genes involving glucose metabolic pathway, mRNA expression of glucose-6-phosphatase 3 (G6PC3) correlated with 18F-FDG LNR (P = 0.03). In addition, G6PC3 mRNA expression in 18F-FMISO high-accumulated glioblastomas was significantly higher than that in 18F-FMISO low-accumulated glioblastomas (P < 0.01). Protein expression of G6PC3 was consistent with mRNA expression, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. These findings indicated that the G6PC3 expression might be facilitated by hypoxic condition in glioblastomas. Next, we investigated the clinical relevance of G6PC3 in terms of prognosis. Among the glioblastoma patients who received gross total resection, mRNA expressions of G6PC3 in the patients with poor prognosis (less than 1-year survival) were significantly higher than that in the patients who survive more than 3 years. Moreover, high mRNA expression of G6PC3 was associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma, as validated by TCGA database. Conclusion: G6PC3 was affluently expressed in glioblastoma tissues with coincidentally high 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO accumulation. Further, it might work as a prognostic biomarker of glioblastoma. Therefore, G6PC3 is a potential key molecule of glucose metabolism under hypoxia in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38449509

"""Assessment of treatment response to dendritic cell vaccine in patients with glioblastoma using a multiparametric MRI-based prediction model.""","""Purpose: Autologous tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax-L) is a promising treatment modality for glioblastomas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential utility of multiparametric MRI-based prediction model in evaluating treatment response in glioblastoma patients treated with DCVax-L. Methods: Seventeen glioblastoma patients treated with standard-of-care therapy + DCVax-L were included. When tumor progression (TP) was suspected and repeat surgery was being contemplated, we sought to ascertain the number of cases correctly classified as TP + mixed response or pseudoprogression (PsP) from multiparametric MRI-based prediction model using histopathology/mRANO criteria as ground truth. Multiparametric MRI model consisted of predictive probabilities (PP) of tumor progression computed from diffusion and perfusion MRI-derived parameters. A comparison of overall survival (OS) was performed between patients treated with standard-of-care therapy + DCVax-L and standard-of-care therapy alone (external controls). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to compare OS between two groups of patients using PsP, Ki-67, and MGMT promoter methylation status as stratification variables. Results: Multiparametric MRI model correctly predicted TP + mixed response in 72.7% of cases (8/11) and PsP in 83.3% (5/6) with an overall concordance rate of 76.5% with final diagnosis as determined by histopathology/mRANO criteria. There was a significant concordant correlation coefficient between PP values and histopathology/mRANO criteria (r = 0.54; p = 0.026). DCVax-L-treated patients had significantly prolonged OS than those treated with standard-of-care therapy (22.38 ± 12.8 vs. 13.8 ± 9.5 months, p = 0.040). Additionally, glioblastomas with PsP, MGMT promoter methylation status, and Ki-67 values below median had longer OS than their counterparts.

"""The clinical characteristics and outcomes of incidentally discovered glioblastoma.""","""Objective: With an increase in the number of imaging examinations and the development of imaging technology, a small number of glioblastomas (GBMs) are identified by incidental radiological images. These incidentally discovered glioblastomas (iGBMs) are rare, and their clinical features are not well understood. Here, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of iGBM. Methods: Data of newly diagnosed iGBM patients who were treated at our institution between August 2005 and October 2019 were reviewed. An iGBM was defined as a GBM without a focal sign, discovered on radiological images obtained for reasons unrelated to the tumor. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 315 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, four (1.3%) were classified as having iGBM. Health screening was the most common reason for tumor discovery (75.0%). The preoperative Karnofsky performance status score was 100 in three patients. Tumors were found on the right side in three cases. The mean volume of preoperative enhanced tumor lesion was 16.8 cm3. The median duration from confirmation of an enhanced lesion to surgery was 13.5 days. In all cases, either total (100%) or subtotal (95-99%) resections were achieved. The median PFS and OS were 10.5 and 20.0 months, respectively. Conclusions: The iGBMs were often small and in the right non-eloquent area, and the patients had good performance status. We found that timely therapeutic intervention provided iGBM patients with favorable outcomes.

Materials and methods: Forty-one patients (twenty glioblastomas and twenty-one brain metastases) were retrospectively evaluated. MRIs were analyzed with Olea Sphere® 3.0. Lesions' volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn on enhanced 3D T1 MP-RAGE and projected on ADC and rCBV co-registered maps. Another two VOIs were drawn in the region of hyperintense cerebral edema, surrounding the lesion, respectively, within 5 mm around the enhancing tumor and into residual edema. Perfusion curves were obtained, and the value of signal recovery (SR) was reported. A two-sample T test was obtained to compare all parameters of GB and BM groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: According to ROC analysis, the area under the curve was 88%, 78% and 74%, respectively, for mean ADC VOI values of the solid component, the mean and max rCBV values in the perilesional edema and the PSR. The cumulative ROC curve of these parameters reached an area under the curve of 95%. Using perilesional max rCBV > 1.37, PSR > 75% and mean lesional ADC < 1 × 10-3 mm2 s-1 GB could be differentiated from solitary BM (sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 86%). Conclusion: Lower values of ADC in the enhancing tumor, a higher percentage of SR in perfusion curves and higher values of rCBV in the peritumoral edema closed to the lesion are strongly indicative of GB than solitary BM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35316518
"""Present and potential future issues in glioblastoma treatment.""","""The treatment of glioblastomas requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes the presently incurable nature of the disease into consideration. Treatments are multimodal and include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current recommendations are that patients with glioblastomas should undergo maximum surgical resection, followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the novel alkylating drug temozolomide. This is then to be followed by additional adjuvant temozolomide for a period of up to 6 months. Major advances in surgical and imaging technologies used to treat glioblastoma patients are described. These technologies include magnetic resonance imaging and metabolic data that are helpful in the diagnosis and guiding of surgical resection. However, glioblastomas almost invariably recur near their initial sites. Disease progression usually occurs within 6 months and leads rapidly to death. A number of signaling pathways can be activated constitutively in migrating glioma cells, thus rendering these cells resistant to proapoptotic insults, such as conventional chemotherapies. Therefore, the molecular and cellular therapies and local drug delivery that could be used to complement conventional treatments are described, and some of the currently ongoing clinical trials are reviewed, with respect to these new approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16759163

"""Association between post-operative hPG(80) (circulating progastrin) detectable level and worse prognosis in glioblastoma.""","""Background: Patients with glioblastomas have a dismal prognosis, and there is no circulating predictive or prognostic biomarker. Circulating progastrin, hPG80, is a tumor-promoting peptide present in the blood of patients with various cancers that has been shown to have prognostic value. We evaluated the prognostic value of plasma hPG80 in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild type glioblastoma after surgery. Patients and methods: A multicentric retrospective study in glioblastoma patients treated with standard radio-chemotherapy was conducted. The hPG80 levels were measured in plasma EDTA samples collected after surgery with an ELISA DxPG80.lab kit (Biodena Care, Montpellier, France), which has a detection threshold of 1.2 pM. The relationship between post-operative hPG80 plasma levels, in combination with other known prognostic factors, and patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Results: Sixty-nine patients were assessable. Plasma samples were collected after tumor biopsy (B), partial resection (PR), and complete resection (CR) for 22, 25, and 22 patients, respectively. At a median concentration of 5.37 pM (interquartile range 0.00-13.90 pM), hPG80 was detected in 48 (70%) patients (hPG80+). CR was associated with significant lower values of hPG80 levels: the median value was 0.7 versus 9.1 pM for PR (P = 0.02) and 8.3 pM for B (P = 0.004). The hPG80 detection rate was also significantly lower: 50% (CR) versus 72% (PR) versus 86% (B) (P = 0.005). The median follow-up was 39 months [22.4 months-not reached]. hPG80 post-operative detection was associated with numerically shorter PFS (6.4 versus 9.4 months, P = 0.13) and OS (14.5 versus 20.9 months, P = 0.11). In multivariate analysis, hPG80 was a prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.034).

"""OCT4B Isoform Promotes Anchorage-Independent Growth of Glioblastoma Cells.""","""OCT4, also known as POU5F1 (POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1), is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and is one of the reprogramming factors required for generating induced pluripotent stem cells. The human OCT4 encodes three isoforms, OCT4A, OCT4B, and OCT4B1, which are generated by alternative splicing. Currently, the functions and expression patterns of OCT4B remain largely unknown in malignancies, especially in human glioblastomas. Here, we demonstrated the function of OCT4B in human glioblastomas. Among the isoform of OCT4B, OCT4B-190 (OCT4B19kDa) was highly expressed in human glioblastoma stem cells and glioblastoma cells and was mainly detected in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Overexpression of OCT4B19kDa promoted colony formation of glioblastoma cells when grown in soft agar culture conditions. Clinical data analysis revealed that patients with gliomas that expressed OCT4B at high levels had a poorer prognosis than patients with gliomas that expressed OCT4B at low levels. Thus, OCT4B19kDa may play a crucial role in regulating cancer cell survival and adaption in a rigid environment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30622231

Not all glioblastomas are amenable to surgical resection and anatomic location is one potentially limiting factor. Glioblastomas that invade the corpus callosum and cross midline to the contralateral hemisphere-butterfly glioblastomas (bGBMs)-are one subgroup of tumors traditionally deemed inoperable. Methods: We evaluate the management of bGBMs at our institution to assess whether surgical resection is feasible, safe, and more effective than biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed our institutional brain tumor registry for all adult patients treated for glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV) between 2004 and 2016 to identify all bGBMs. Results: Survival between biopsy and resection was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier model. Twenty-nine (3.8%) of 764 newly diagnosed GBMs were identified as bGBM. Of these, 9 patients (31.0%) underwent surgical resection and 20 patients (69.0%) underwent biopsy. Five patients (55.6%) in the surgical resection group had 98% extent of resection or greater. Median survival of our entire cohort of patients was 3.3 months. Median survival was higher in the surgical resection groups (7.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.0019). Increased age is independently associated with increased risk of death, and adjuvant therapy is independently associated with prolonged survival.

All patients had confirmed tumor residues according to findings of histopathological and/or long-term clinical and radiological follow-ups. Lesion characterization data, including SUVmax and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) on PET/CT were attained. PET/CT and MRI findings were compared in terms of number of lesions. The correlation between immunohistochemistry, molecular expression, and PET/CT parameters was also evaluated. Results: 18 F-FAPI PET/CT detected 16 FAPI-avid out of 23 lesions in 12 patients described on MRI. MRI was statistically different from 18 F-FAPI PET/CT for lesion detection according to the exact McNemar statistical test (P = 0.0156). The SUVmax and TBR of the glioblastomas was 7.08 ± 3.55 and 19.95 ± 13.22, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 18 F-FAPI PET were 69.6% and 100%, respectively. Neither the Ki-67 index nor the molecular expression was correlated with the FAPI-PET/CT parameters. Conclusion: 18 F-FAPI PET/CT detects glioblastomas at a lower rate than MRI. However, the 100% PPV of the examination may make it useful for differentiating controversial lesions detected on MRI.

Imaging tumor blood flow may help assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments. We determined the clinical usefulness of stable xenon CT performed preoperatively in patients with glioblastoma. This is a prospective cohort study. We determined absolute tumor blood flow before surgery in 38 patients with glioblastoma using stable xenon CT. We also histologically examined tumor specimens obtained from surgery and quantified their vascularity (by CD31 and CD105 immunostain), necrosis (by hematoxylin and eosin stain), and the presence of neuronal processes (by neurofilament immunostain). According to the xenon CT blood flow map, there are 3 types of glioblastoma. Type I glioblastomas have unimodal high blood flow histograms; histologically there is little necrosis and vascular proliferation. Type II glioblastomas have unimodal low blood flow histograms; histologically there is prominent necrosis and vascular proliferation. We propose that in type II glioblastoma, the abnormal vessels induced by hypoxia are inefficient at promoting blood flow. Type III glioblastomas have multimodal blood flow histograms. Histologically there is significant neuronal tissue within the tumor. Patients with type III glioblastomas were more likely to develop a post-surgical deficit, consistent with the inclusion of normal tissue within the tumor.

Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapy is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy in the treatment of glioblastomas, since these cells can select and lyse therapy-resistant glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLCs). Immunotherapy with super-charged NK cells has a potential as antitumor approach since we found their efficiency to kill patient-derived GSLCs in 2D and 3D models, potentially reversing the immunosuppression also seen in the patients. In addition to their potent cytotoxicity, NK cells secrete IFN-γ, upregulate GSLC surface expression of CD54 and MHC class I and increase sensitivity of GSLCs to chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, NK cell localization in peri-vascular regions in glioblastoma tissues and their close contact with GSLCs in tumorospheres suggests their ability to infiltrate glioblastoma tumors and target GSLCs.

In 107 glioblastomas aged from 17 to 35 years, mutually exclusive BRAF-V600E (15%), H3F3A-K27M (15.9%), H3F3A-G34R/V (2.8%) and IDH1-R132H (16.8%) mutations were identified in over half of the cases. EGFR amplification and TERTp mutation were only detected in 3.7% and 8.4% in young adult glioblastomas, respectively. BRAF-V600E identified a clinically favorable subset of glioblastomas with younger age, frequent CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and was more amendable to surgical resection. H3F3A-K27M mutated glioblastomas were tightly associated with midline locations and showed dismal prognosis. IDH1-R132H was associated with older age and favorable outcome.

A total of six cases originally diagnosed as 'gliosarcomas' were compared with four cases of glioblastoma multiforme. No clinical or prognostic features were defined which would clearly separate 'gliosarcomas' from glioblastoma multiforme. Macroscopically, biopsies from 'gliosarcomas' ranged from firm, apparently well-circumscribed tumours to poorly circumscribed lesions with a soft consistency resembling glioblastoma multiforme. Histology revealed a continuous spectrum in which 'gliosarcomas' with large reticulin-rich areas of spindle cells merged with typical glioblastomas containing only small islands of spindle cells and reticulin staining. Immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); S100 protein and alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) showed that the majority of cells in reticulin-poor areas of 'gliosarcoma' and glioblastomas expressed S100 protein and GFAP; many expressed ASMA and some expressed both GFAP and ASMA. Spindle cells in reticulin-rich areas of 'gliosarcomas' and glioblastomas most frequently expressed ASMA but many cells also expressed S100 protein and GFAP; some cells expressed both GFAP and ASMA. The results of this study and a review of the literature suggests that there is a clinical, radiological and pathological continuum with glioblastoma and 'gliosarcoma' at different ends of the spectrum.

"""Major Contribution of Caspase-9 to Honokiol-Induced Apoptotic Insults to Human Drug-Resistant Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Temozolomide (TMZ)-induced chemoresistance to human glioblastomas is a critical challenge now. Our previous studies showed that honokiol, a major bioactive constituent of Magnolia officinalis (Houpo), can kill human glioblastoma cells and suppresses glioblastoma growth. This study was further aimed to evaluate the effects of honokiol on human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells and the possible mechanisms. The results by data mining in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and immunohistochemistry displayed that expression of caspase-9 mRNA and protein in human glioblastomas was induced. Human TMZ-resistant U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells were selected and prepared from human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells. Compared to human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells, TMZ did not affect viability of U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells. Interestingly, treatment with honokiol suppressed proliferation and survival of human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Compared to caspase-8 activation, honokiol chiefly increased activity of caspase-9 in U87-MG-R9 cells. Successively, levels of cleaved caspase-3 and activities of caspase-3 and caspase-6 in human TMZ-tolerant glioblastoma cells were augmented following honokiol administration. In parallel, honokiol triggered DNA fragmentation of U87-MG-R9 cells. Accordingly, treatment of human TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells with honokiol induced cell apoptosis but did not affect cell necrosis. Fascinatingly, suppressing caspase-9 activity using its specific inhibitors repressed honokiol-induced caspase-6 activation, DNA fragmentation, and cell apoptosis. Taken together, this study has shown the major roles of caspase-9 in transducing honokiol-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells. Thus, honokiol may be clinically applied as a drug candidate for treatment of glioblastoma patients with chemoresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32210117
"""CD47 Promotes Human Glioblastoma Invasion Through Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway.""","""Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) overexpression is common in various malignancies. This study investigated whether CD47 promotes human glioblastoma invasion and, if so, the underlying mechanisms involved. CD47 expression was found to be stronger in tissues of patients with glioblastoma and in various cancer cell lines than in normal controls. CD47 downregulation via siRNA suppressed invasion in vitro, whereas CD47 overexpression through plasmid transfection exerted the opposite effect. However, overexpression or knocking down of CD47 had no effect on cell proliferation. Moreover, CD47 expression was related to Akt phosphorylation at the cellular molecular level. Suppression of Akt with a specific inhibitor impaired the invasion ability of CD47-overexpressing cells, indicating that stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway served as the downstream regulator of CD47-triggered invasion. These results suggest that CD47 might be a useful predictor of poor prognosis and metastasis and a potential target for treating glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29321087
"""Prognostic value of 11C-methionine volume-based PET parameters in IDH wild type glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: 11C-Methionine (11C-MET) PET prognostication of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type glioblastomas is inadequate as conventional parameters such as standardized uptake value (SUV) do not adequately reflect tumor heterogeneity. We retrospectively evaluated whether volume-based parameters such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion methionine metabolism (TLMM) outperformed SUV for survival correlation in patients with IDH wild type glioblastomas. Methods: Thirteen IDH wild type glioblastoma patients underwent preoperative 11C-MET PET. Both SUV-based parameters and volume-based parameters were calculated for each lesion. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing and Cox regression analysis were used for correlation between PET parameters and overall survival. Results: Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 393 days. MTV (HR 1.136, p = 0.007) and TLMM (HR 1.022, p = 0.030) were inversely correlated with overall survival. SUV-based 11C-MET PET parameters did not show a correlation with survival. In a paired analysis with other clinical parameters including age and radiotherapy dose, MTV and TLMM were found to be independent factors. Conclusions: MTV and TLMM, and not SUV, significantly correlate with overall survival in patients with IDH wild type glioblastomas. The incorporation of volume-based 11C-MET PET parameters may lead to a better outcome prediction for this heterogeneous patient population.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35213602

Methods: This multicenter study included 327 patients with IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype glioblastoma in the 2016 World Health Organization classification who preoperatively underwent MRI. Isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status was determined by immunohistochemistry, high-resolution melting analysis, and/or IDH1/2 sequencing. Three radiologists independently reviewed the tumor location, tumor contrast enhancement, noncontrast-enhancing tumor (nCET), and peritumoral edema. Two radiologists independently measured the maximum tumor size and mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficients of the tumor. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with an odds ratio (OR) were performed. Results: The tumors were IDH-wildtype glioblastoma in 306 cases and IDH-mutant glioblastoma in 21. Interobserver agreement for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations was moderate to excellent. The univariate analyses revealed a significant difference in age, seizure, tumor contrast enhancement, and nCET ( P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis revealed significant difference in age for all 3 readers (reader 1, odds ratio [OR] = 0.960, P = 0.012; reader 2, OR = 0.966, P = 0.048; reader 3, OR = 0.964, P = 0.026) and nCET for 2 readers (reader 1, OR = 3.082, P = 0.080; reader 2, OR = 4.500, P = 0.003; reader 3, OR = 3.078, P = 0.022).

"""Expression and Prognostic Value of CD80 and CD86 in the Tumor Microenvironment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Strategies to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) have opened new therapeutic avenues with dramatic yet heterogeneous intertumoral efficacy in multiple cancers, including glioblastomas (GBMs). Therefore, investigating molecular actors of TME may help understand the interactions between tumor cells and TME. Immune checkpoint proteins such as a Cluster of Differentiation 80 (CD80) and CD86 are expressed on the surface of tumor cells and infiltrative tumor lymphocytes. However, their expression and prognostic value in GBM microenvironment are still unclear. Methods: In this study, we investigated, in a retrospective local discovery cohort and a validation TCGA dataset, expression of CD80 and CD86 at mRNA level and their prognostic significance in response to standard of care. Furthermore, CD80 and CD86 at the protein level were investigated in the discovery cohort. Results: Both CD80 and CD86 are expressed heterogeneously in the TME at mRNA and protein levels. In a univariate analysis, the mRNA expression of CD80 and CD86 was not significantly correlated with OS in both local OncoNeuroTek dataset and TCGA datasets. CD80 and CD86 mRNA high expression was significantly associated with shorter progression free survival (PFS) (p < 0.05). These findings were validated using the TCGA cohort; higher CD80 and CD86 expressions were correlated with shorter PFS (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, CD86 mRNA expression was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in the TCGA dataset only (p < 0.05). Conclusion: CD86 could be used as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of GBM patients treated with immunotherapy; however, additional studies are needed to validate these findings.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35022089
"""Prognostic significance of MRI contrast enhancement in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype according to WHO 2021 classification.""","""Background and objectives: Contrast enhancement in glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is common but not systematic. In the era of the WHO 2021 Classification of CNS Tumors, the prognostic impact of a contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement is not clearly elucidated. Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective, single-centre cohort study at a tertiary neurosurgical oncology centre (January 2006 - December 2022). We screened adult patients with a newly-diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype in order to assess the prognosis role of the contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement. Results: We included 1149 glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype: 26 (2.3%) had a no contrast enhancement, 45 (4.0%) had a faint and patchy contrast enhancement, 118 (10.5%) had a nodular contrast enhancement, and 960 (85.5%) had a ring-like contrast enhancement. Overall survival was longer in non-contrast enhanced glioblastomas (26.7 months) than in contrast enhanced glioblastomas (10.9 months) (p < 0.001). In contrast enhanced glioblastomas, a ring-like pattern was associated with shorter overall survival than in faint and patchy and nodular patterns (10.0 months versus 13.0 months, respectively) (p = 0.033). Whatever the presence of a contrast enhancement and the pattern of contrast enhancement, surgical resection was an independent predictor of longer overall survival, while age ≥ 70 years, preoperative KPS score < 70, tumour volume ≥ 30cm3, and postoperative residual contrast enhancement were independent predictors of shorter overall survival. Conclusion: A contrast enhancement is present in the majority (97.7%) of glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype and, regardless of the pattern, is associated with a shorter overall survival. The ring-like pattern of contrast enhancement is typical in glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype (85.5%) and remains an independent predictor of shorter overall survival compared to other patterns (faint and patchy and nodular).""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38913230

"""Induction of apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppression of ERK/NF-kappaB signalling participate in anti-glioblastoma of imipramine.""","""Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of brain tumour, with poor prognosis even after standard treatment such as surgical resection, temozolomide and radiation therapy. The overexpression of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in glioblastomas is recognized as an important treatment target. Thus, an urgent need regarding glioblastomas is the development of a new, suitable agent that may show potential for the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has anti-inflammatory actions against inflamed glial cells; additionally, imipramine can induce glioblastoma toxicity via the activation of autophagy. However, whether imipramine can suppress glioblastoma progression via the induction of apoptosis and blockage of ERK/NF-κB signalling remains unclear. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of imipramine on apoptotic signalling and ERK/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression by using cell proliferation (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT] assay), flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cell invasion/migration assay analysis in vitro. The ERK and NF-κB inhibitory capacity of imipramine is detected by NF-κB reporter gene assay and Western blotting. Additionally, a glioblastoma-bearing animal model was used to validate the therapeutic efficacy and general toxicity of imipramine. Our results demonstrated that imipramine successfully triggered apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppressed the invasion/migration ability of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, imipramine effectively suppressed glioblastoma progression in vivo via the inhibition of the ERK/NF-κB pathway. In summary, imipramine is a potential anti-glioblastoma drug which induces apoptosis and has the capacity to inhibit ERK/NF-κB signalling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149465
"""A deep convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of glioblastoma brain tumor: Joint spatial pyramid module and attention mechanism network.""","""This study proposes a deep convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of glioblastoma brain tumors, aiming sat replacing the manual segmentation method that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. There are many challenges for automatic segmentation to finely segment sub-regions from multi-sequence magnetic resonance images because of the complexity and variability of glioblastomas, such as the loss of boundary information, misclassified regions, and subregion size. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a spatial pyramid module and attention mechanism to the automatic segmentation algorithm, which focuses on multi-scale spatial details and context information. The proposed method has been tested in the public benchmarks BraTS 2018, BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020 and BraTS 2021 datasets.

Importantly, these combinations exhibited minimal effects on the growth of normal stem cells. In this study, we extended our investigation to include a patient-derived GBM stem cell line. Our results showed that the combinations of modulators of histone and DNA covalent modifying enzymes that synergistically suppress D54 and U87 cell line growth also impair the viability of the patient-derived GBM stem cell line.

"""Epigenetically regulated lncRNAs dissect the intratumoural heterogeneity and facilitate immune evasion of glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors that occupied a highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TIME). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose expression can be modified by DNA methylation, are emerging as critical regulators in the immune system. However, knowledge about the epigenetic changes in lncRNAs and their contribution to the immune heterogeneity of glioma is still lacking. Methods: In this study, we integrated paired methylome and transcriptome datasets of glioblastomas and identified 2 robust immune subtypes based on lncRNA methylation features. The immune characteristics of glioma subtypes were compared. Furthermore, immune-related lncRNAs were identified and their relationships with immune evasion were evaluated. Results: Glioma immunophenotypes exhibited distinct immune-related characteristics as well as clinical and epigenetic features. 149 epigenetically regulated (ER) lncRNAs were recognized that possessed inverse variation in epigenetic and transcriptional levels between glioma subtypes. Immune-related lncRNAs were further identified through the investigation of their correlation with immune cell infiltrations and immune-related pathways. In particular, the 'Hot' glioma subtype with higher immunoactivity while a worse survival outcome was found to character immune evasion features. We finally prioritized candidate ER lncRNAs associated with immune evasion markers and response to glioma immunotherapy. Among them, CD109-AS1 and LINC02447 were validated as novel immunoevasive biomarkers for glioma through in vitro experiments.

After fully automated segmentation, radiomic features were extracted. Three conventional machine learning classifiers, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), adaptive boosting (Adaboost), and support vector machine with the linear kernel (SVC), combined with one of four feature selection methods, including forward sequential feature selection, F score, mutual information, and LASSO, were trained. Additionally, one ensemble classifier based on the three classifiers was used.

A lot of experimental models are used to evaluate various properties of glioblastoma. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane model is one of them. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate histology and survival of glioblastoma tumors taken immediately from operating theatre and transplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Glioblastoma samples obtained from 10 patients were transplanted onto 200 eggs. Overall, we used 15 tumors; only 5 of them were not glioblastomas as it was revealed later. RESULTS. The transplanted tumors survive up to 6 days. Transplants do not survive longer because during embryo's development the nourishing membrane dries. Transplanted glioblastomas exhibited the same features as original glioblastomas - necrosis, endothelium proliferation, cellular polymorphism - while transplanted glioblastomas also showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, Ki67, S100 protein, neurofilament immunoreactivity, and infiltration of macrophages (CD68) and T cells (CD3(+), CD8(+)). Transplanted glioblastomas did not show any immunoreactivity of p53. Invasion of vessels from the chicken into transplanted tumor is not observed. Chicken erythrocytes did not appear within the transplants, and tumor cells invade chicken tissue at the minimum. CONCLUSION. Our data show that transplanted pieces of glioblastoma survive with all cytological features. The presence of macrophages (marker CD68) and T cells (markers CD3(+) and CD8(+)) can be registered in the transplant. The data revealed that transplanted glioblastoma remains as insulated unit, which survives from nourishment of the chorioallantoic membrane apparently only by diffusion.

An integrin-targeting NIRF probe, IRDye 800CW-cyclic-RGD peptide (IRDye 800CW-RGD), was tested by in vivo and ex vivo NIRF imaging. Results: We show that the IRDye 800CW-RGD peptide: (i) specifically binds to integrin receptors; (ii) is selectively localized to glioblastoma tissue with overexpressed integrin receptors and is retained over prolonged periods of time; (iii) is associated with minimal autofluorescence and photobleaching because of imaging at 800 nm; (iv) provides delineation of tumor tissue with high precision because of a high tumor-to-normal brain fluorescence ratio (79.7 ± 6.9, 31.2 ± 2.8, and 16.3 ± 1.3) in the U-87 MG, RCAS-PDGF, and TS543 models, respectively; P < 0.01); and (v) enables fluorescence-guided glioblastoma resection. Importantly, small foci of residual fluorescence were observed after resection was completed using white light imaging alone, and these fluorescent foci were shown to represent residual tumor tissue by histology. Conclusions: NIRF imaging with the IRDye 800CW-RGD probe provides a simple, rapid, low-cost, nonradioactive, and highly translatable approach for improved intraoperative glioblastoma visualization and resection.

All patients with histologically proven intramedullary spinal cord glioblastoma treated in our department were included in this study. Results: Four patients with intramedullary spinal cord glioblastoma were identified between 2006 and 2015, all of whom were female. Mean age at the time of surgery was 33.5 years (range 14-50 years). Tumors were located in the cervical region in 2 patients and in the thoracic region in 2 patients. All 4 patients underwent microsurgical biopsy of the tumor.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in performing supratotal resections (SpTRs) for glioblastoma. Objective: To address the published results, which have varied in part due to lack of consensus on the definition and appropriate use of SpTR. Methods: A crowdsourcing approach was used to survey 21 neurosurgical oncologists representing 14 health systems nationwide. Participants were presented with 11 definitions of SpTR and asked to rate the appropriateness of each definition. Participants reviewed T1-weighed postcontrast and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging for 22 anatomically distinct glioblastomas. Participants were asked to assess the tumor location's eloquence, the perceived equipoise of enrolling patients in a randomized trial comparing gross total to SpTR, and their personal treatment plans. Results: Most neurosurgeons surveyed (n = 18, 85.7%) agree that GTR plus resection of some noncontrast enhancement is an appropriate definition for SpTR. Overall, moderate inter-rater agreement existed regarding eloquence, equipoise, and personal treatment plans. The 4 neurosurgeons who had performed >10 SpTRs for glioblastomas in the past year were more likely to recommend it as their treatment plan (P < .005). Cases were divided into 3 anatomically distinct groups based upon perceived eloquence. Anterior temporal and right frontal glioblastomas were considered the best randomization candidates.

We compared HMGA2 expression between glioblastoma and normal brain tissue. In addition, we analyzed and compared HMGA2 expression in the border and center zones of tumors. Correlation tests between HMGA expression and clinical parameters such as MGMT-status and survival were performed. Methods: Samples from 23 patients with WHO grade 4 glioblastomas were analyzed for HMGA2 expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated with clinical parameters. The areas from the tumor center and border were analyzed separately. Two normal brain tissue specimens were used as the controls. Results: Our results confirm that HMGA2 is higher expressed in glioblastoma compared to healthy brain tissue (qPCR, P=0.013; IHC, P=0.04). Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher HMGA2 expression in the border zone of the tumor than in the tumor center zone (P=0.012). Survival analysis revealed a tendency for shorter survival when HMGA2 was highly expressed in the border zone.

Despite the inability of histologic and molecular genetic studies to identify distinguishing features between RIGs and pediatric GBMs, gene microarrays suggested significant differences between these 2 tumor types, at least those occurring in pediatric patients. Pediatric RIGs show greater homogeneity of gene expression than do de novo pediatric GBMs. Greater overlap was detected in gene expression patterns between RIGs and pilocytic astrocytomas than between RIGs and GBMs, medulloblastomas, ependymomas, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, or rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting a common precursor cell for RIG and pilocytic astrocytoma.

"""Regulation of Fibroblast Activation Protein by Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 in Glioblastoma Microenvironment.""","""The proline-specific serine protease fibroblast activation protein (FAP) can participate in the progression of malignant tumors and represents a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target. Recently, we demonstrated an increased expression of FAP in glioblastomas, particularly those of the mesenchymal subtype. Factors controlling FAP expression in glioblastomas are unknown, but evidence suggests that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) can trigger mesenchymal changes in these tumors. Here, we investigated whether TGFbeta promotes FAP expression in transformed and stromal cells constituting the glioblastoma microenvironment. We found that both FAP and TGFbeta-1 are upregulated in glioblastomas and display a significant positive correlation. We detected TGFbeta-1 immunopositivity broadly in glioblastoma tissues, including tumor parenchyma regions in the immediate vicinity of FAP-immunopositive perivascular stromal cells. Wedemonstrate for the first time that TGFbeta-1 induces expression of FAP in non-stem glioma cells, pericytes, and glioblastoma-derived endothelial and FAP+ mesenchymal cells, but not in glioma stem-like cells. In glioma cells, this effect is mediated by the TGFbeta type I receptor and canonical Smad signaling and involves activation of FAP gene transcription. We further present evidence of FAP regulation by TGFbeta-1 secreted by glioma cells. Our results provide insight into the previously unrecognized regulation of FAP expression by autocrine and paracrine TGFbeta-1 signaling in a broad spectrum of cell types present in the glioblastoma microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33494271
"""[Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme: a case report].""","""Introduction: Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme (CGM) accounts for less than 1% of all intracranial glioblastomas; it spreads quickly locally, above all towards the brain stem and adjacent leptomeninges, and has a poor prognosis. Case report: We report the case of a 55 year old patient who presented a continuous feeling of dizziness, instability and sickness, with occasionally vomiting and double vision that had started two months before being admitted to hospital. A physical exploration revealed hypaesthesia of the right side of the face, tactile and algesic hypaesthesia in the left side of the body and nystagmus in the bilateral horizontal gaze. Results of the general physical exploration were normal. A magnetic resonance (MR) brain scan revealed a 3 cm expansive lesion in the middle cerebellar peduncle and right cerebellar hemisphere, which was hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2. Administering contrast showed it to be heterogeneous, with irregular annular enhancement, and perilesional edema. Subtotal excision of the lesion was performed and pathological analysis allowed a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme to be made; radio and chemotherapy were continued. Conclusion: CGM is infrequent and 46.7 years is the mean age of onset. 59% of tumours are located in the hemispheres, they tend to spread locally, and remote metastases have also been reported. Initial clinical manifestations are intracranial hypertension, and gait and balance disorders. Differential diagnosis is provided by MR and includes metastasis, infarction and abscesses. Treatment involves radical surgical excision followed by local radiotherapy. The use of chemotherapy has been reported but its role in the treatment of this entity is still not altogether clear.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15152353

Standard of care is resection followed by chemo-radiation therapy. Despite this aggressive approach, >80% of glioblastomas recur in proximity to the resection cavity. Brachytherapy is an attractive strategy for improving local control. GammaTile® is a newly US FDA-cleared device which incorporates 131Cs radiation emitting seeds in a resorbable collagen-based carrier tile for surgically targeted radiation therapy to achieve highly conformal radiation at the time of surgery.

"""Application of blood brain barrier models in pre-clinical assessment of glioblastoma-targeting CAR-T based immunotherapies.""","""Human blood brain barrier (BBB) models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become an important tool for the discovery and preclinical evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) targeting cell and gene-based therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a revolutionary form of gene-modified cell-based immunotherapy with potential for targeting solid tumors, such as glioblastomas. Crossing the BBB is an important step in the systemic application of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of glioblastomas and other CNS malignancies. In addition, even CAR-T therapies targeting non-CNS antigens, such as the well-known CD19-CAR-T therapies, are known to trigger CNS side-effects including brain swelling due to BBB disruption. In this study, we used iPSC-derived brain endothelial-like cell (iBEC) transwell co-culture model to assess BBB extravasation of CAR-T based immunotherapies targeting U87MG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells overexpressing the tumor-specific mutated protein EGFRvIII (U87vIII). Two types of anti-EGFRvIII targeting CAR-T cells, with varying tonic signaling profiles (CAR-F263 and CAR-F269), and control Mock T cells were applied on the luminal side of BBB model in vitro. CAR-F263 and CAR-F269 T cells triggered a decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and an increase in BBB permeability. CAR-T cell extravasation and U87vIII cytotoxicity were assessed from the abluminal compartment using flow cytometry and Incucyte real-time viability imaging, respectively. A significant decrease in U87vIII cell viability was observed over 48 h, with the most robust cytotoxicity response observed for the constitutively activated CAR-F263. CAR-F269 T cells showed a similar cytotoxic profile but were approximately four fold less efficient at killing the U87vIII cells compared to CAR-F263, despite similar transmigration rates. Visualization of CAR-T cell extravasation across the BBB was further confirmed using BBTB-on-CHIP models. The described BBB assay was able to discriminate the cytotoxic efficacies of different EGFRvIII-CARs and provide a measure of potential alterations to BBB integrity. Collectively, we illustrate how BBB models in vitro can be a valuable tool in deciphering the mechanisms of CAR-T-induced BBB disruption, accompanying toxicity and effector function on post-barrier target cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35650594
"""Expression of 19 microRNAs in glioblastoma and comparison with other brain neoplasia of grades I-III.""","""Several biomarkers have been proposed as useful parameters to better specify the prognosis or to delineate new target therapy strategies for glioblastoma patients. MicroRNAs could represent putative target molecules, considering their role in tumorigenesis, cancer progression and their specific tissue expression. Although several studies have tried to identify microRNA signature for glioblastoma, a microRNA profile is still far from being well-defined. In this work the expression of 19 microRNAs (miR-7, miR-9, miR-9∗, miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-31, miR-34a, miR-101, miR-137, miR-182, miR-221, miR-222, miR-330, miR-519d) was evaluated in sixty formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded glioblastoma samples using a locked nucleic acid real-time PCR. Moreover, a comparison of miRNA expressions was performed between primary brain neoplasias of different grades (grades IV-I). The analysis of 14 validated miRNA expression in the 60 glioblastomas, using three different non-neoplastic references as controls, revealed a putative miRNA signature: mir-10b and miR-21 were up-regulated, while miR-7, miR-31, miR-101, miR-137, miR-222 and miR-330 were down-regulated in glioblastomas. Comparing miRNA expression between glioblastoma group and gliomas of grades I-III, 3 miRNAs (miR-10b, mir-34a and miR-101) showed different regulation statuses between high-grade and low-grade tumors. miR-10b was up-regulated in high grade and significantly down-regulated in low-grade gliomas, suggesting that could be a candidate for a GBM target therapy. This study provides further data for the identification of a miRNA profile for glioblastoma and suggests that different-grade neoplasia could be characterized by different expression of specific miRNAs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24412053

Among these, pediatric glioblastomas (GBMs) comprise 2.9% of all central nervous system tumors and have a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the imaging findings can be a prognostic factor for survival in children with GBMs. Materials and methods: The imaging studies and clinical data from 64 pediatric patients with pathology-proven GBMs were evaluated. Contrast enhancement patterns were classified into focal, ring-like, and diffuse, based on preoperative postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression to evaluate the prognostic value of imaging findings. Results: Patients with ring-enhanced GBMs who underwent gross total resection or subtotal resection were found to have a significantly shorter progression-free survival ( P = 0.03) comparing with other enhancing and nonenhancing glioblastomas. Conclusions: In this study, we analyzed survival factors in children with pediatric glioblastomas.

"""Multimodal imaging-defined subregions in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: impact on overall survival.""","""Background: Although glioblastomas are heterogeneous brain-infiltrating tumors, their treatment is mostly focused on the contrast-enhancing tumor mass. In this study, we combined conventional MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and amino acid PET to explore imaging-defined glioblastoma subregions and evaluate their potential prognostic value. Methods: Contrast-enhanced T1, T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from DWI, and alpha-[11C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-PET images were analyzed in 30 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Five tumor subregions were identified based on a combination of MRI contrast enhancement, T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities, and AMT uptake on PET. ADC and AMT uptake tumor/contralateral normal cortex (T/N) ratios in these tumor subregions were correlated, and their prognostic value was determined. Results: A total of 115 MRI/PET-defined subregions were analyzed. Most tumors showed not only a high-AMT uptake (T/N ratio > 1.65, N = 27) but also a low-uptake subregion (N = 21) within the contrast-enhancing tumor mass. High AMT uptake extending beyond contrast enhancement was also common (N = 25) and was associated with low ADC (r = -0.40, P = 0.05). Higher AMT uptake in the contrast-enhancing tumor subregions was strongly prognostic for overall survival (hazard ratio: 7.83; 95% CI: 1.98-31.02, P = 0.003), independent of clinical and molecular genetic prognostic variables. Nonresected high-AMT uptake subregions predicted the sites of tumor progression on posttreatment PET performed in 10 patients. Conclusions: Glioblastomas show heterogeneous amino acid uptake with high-uptake regions often extending into non-enhancing brain with high cellularity; nonresection of these predict the site of posttreatment progression. High tryptophan uptake values in MRI contrast-enhancing tumor subregions are a strong, independent imaging marker for longer overall survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30346623

"""Papillary glioblastoma exhibiting a neuroradiological cyst with a mural nodule: A case report.""","""Rationale: Glioblastomas are malignant, infiltrating gliomas classified as grade IV by the World Health Organization. Genetically, most glioblastomas do not exhibit the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 gene mutation and rarely harbor the 1p/19q co-deletion. Neuroradiologically, glioblastomas rarely form a cyst with a mural nodule lesion. Patient concerns: In this study, a 78-year-old woman, with speech difficulty and forgetfulness, had a cystic tumor with a mural nodule in the right frontoparietal lobe. Therefore, partial tumor resection was performed. Diagnosis: Histopathology of the tumor, a glioblastoma, exhibited pseudopapillary features with non-hyalinized capillary cores and rich mini-gemistocytic cells. Genetic analysis of the tumor revealed co-deletion of 1p36/19q13, with wild-type IDH. Interventions: The patient underwent a combination of postoperative radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy before leaving the hospital. After discharge, she was treated by 20 courses of temozolomide chemotherapy. Outcomes: The patient is free from tumor recurrence 23 months after the operation. Lessons: We present a unique case of glioblastoma that exhibited novel neuroradiological, histopathological, and genetic features with a favorable prognosis for the patient. Therefore, a compilation of similar cases with clinicopathological and genetic analyses to characterize this unique glioblastoma is critical.

"""Alterations of the Glymphatic System in Glioblastomas: A Systematic Review.""","""Background/aim: The glioblastomas, aggressive brain tumors with a poor prognosis, have drawn interest in their interaction with the glymphatic system-an emerging brain drainage network. This review explores the relationship between glioblastomas and the glymphatic system, aiming to elucidate their impact on disease progression. The aim of the study was to address the alterations in the glymphatic system in the presence of glioblastoma, and their implications for disease pathogenesis and prognosis. Materials and methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic literature review, identifying studies on the glymphatic system in glioblastomas. Four high-quality studies were selected based on stringent criteria. Data extraction involved categorizing key findings, and thematic analysis uncovered recurring patterns in glymphatic alterations associated with glioblastomas. Results: Out of 356 studies, four meeting the high-quality criteria were included. These studies revealed modifications in lymphatic outflow, factors contributing to glymphatic dysfunction, impediments to cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and emerging roles in glioma management. The findings allow a comprehensive understanding of alterations within the glymphatic system in the presence of glioblastoma. Conclusion: The glymphatic system in glioblastomas exhibits changes, including diminished lymphatic outflow, disruptions and obstacles to fluid drainage, which represent new dimensions in glioma management. These alterations affect drug delivery, immunotherapy, and imaging interpretation. Future research should prioritize elucidating molecular mechanisms, developing therapeutic strategies, optimizing drug delivery, exploring immunotherapy, and translating findings into clinical practice.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39060078

"""MRI Atlas of IDH Wild-Type Supratentorial Glioblastoma: Probabilistic Maps of Phenotype, Management, and Outcomes.""","""Background Tumor location is a main prognostic parameter in patients with glioblastoma. Probabilistic MRI-based brain atlases specifying the probability of tumor location associated with important demographic, clinical, histomolecular, and management data are lacking for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastomas. Purpose To correlate glioblastoma location with clinical phenotype, surgical management, and outcomes by using a probabilistic analysis in a three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based atlas. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included all adults surgically treated for newly diagnosed IDH wild-type supratentorial glioblastoma in a tertiary adult surgical neuro-oncology center (2006-2016). Semiautomated tumor segmentation and spatial normalization procedures to build a 3D MRI-based atlas were validated. The authors performed probabilistic analyses by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping technology. The Liebermeister test was used for binary data, and the generalized linear model was used for continuous data. Results A total of 392 patients (mean age, 61 years ± 13; 233 men) were evaluated. The authors identified the preferential location of glioblastomas according to subventricular zone, age, sex, clinical presentation, revised Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis class, Karnofsky performance status, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status, surgical management, and survival. The superficial location distant from the eloquent area was more likely associated with a preserved functional status at diagnosis (348 of 392 patients [89%], P < .05), a large surgical resection (173 of 392 patients [44%], P < .05), and prolonged overall survival (163 of 334 patients [49%], P < .05). In contrast, deep location and location within eloquent brain areas were more likely associated with an impaired functional status at diagnosis (44 of 392 patients [11%], P < .05), a neurologic deficit (282 of 392 patients [72%], P < .05), treatment with biopsy only (183 of 392 patients [47%], P < .05), and shortened overall survival (171 of 334 patients [51%], P < .05). Conclusion The authors identified the preferential location of isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastomas according to parameters of interest and provided an image-based integration of multimodal information impacting survival results.

This study explored the association between LVC and tumor origin and prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from 115 glioma patients were retrospectively reviewed, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the occurrence of LVC as a function of survival in 43 glioblastoma patients. The mRNA expression profiles were compared by microarray analysis in LV-contacting and non-LV-contacting glioblastomas (LVCGs and NLVCGs, respectively). The sphere-forming and invasive capabilities of LVCG- and NLVCG-derived stem cells were compared in primary glioma stem cell cultures with tumorsphere formation and Matrigel assays, respectively. LVC was more frequently detected in high-grade gliomas which, along with LVCGs, were significantly larger than low-grade gliomas and NLVCGs. LVC parameters were not independent predictors of glioblastoma patient prognosis; the expression profiles (including stemness genes expression) were similar between LVCGs and NLVCGs, and no significant differences were observed in tumorsphere-forming capacity and invasiveness between stem cells derived from the two glioblastoma types.

"""Sulindac induces differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells making them more sensitive to oxidative stress.""","""Glioblastoma tumors (GBM) are very heterogeneous, being comprised of several cell subtypes, including glioblastoma stem cells (GSC). These tumors have a high rate of recurrence after initial treatment and one of the most prevalent theories to explain this is the cancer stem cell theory, which proposes that glioblastomas arise from mutations that transform normal neural stem cells (NSC) into GSC, which are highly resistant to oxidative stress and anti-cancer therapies. Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been shown to protect the normal cells against oxidative damage by initiating a preconditioning response, but selectively sensitizes several cancer cell lines to agents that affect mitochondrial respiration, resulting in enhanced killing of the cancer cells. These effects of sulindac are independent of its NSAID activity. There is little information on the effect of sulindac on normal and cancer stem cells. To study the effect of sulindac on both normal and cancer stem cells, we have isolated normal neural stem cells (NSC), from mice hippocampi and glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) from a glioma cell line, U87. As expected from previous studies sulindac can protect normal astrocytes against oxidative stress. Sulindac induces differentiation of both NSC and GSC cells and sulindac upregulates neurogenesis in NSC. The differentiated NSC are also protected from oxidative stress damage, whereas the differentiation of GSC by sulindac increases the sensitivity of these cells to agents that cause oxidative stress. The S epimer of sulindac is more effective than the R epimer in inducing neuronal differentiation in both NSC and GSC. These results indicate that the ability of sulindac to induce GSC differentiation may have therapeutic value in preventing tumour recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29788733

In the future, the gene expression profile will probably be a stronger prognostic factor than histological grade, but the most relevant gene clusters, whose expression may be correlated with survival, remain to be identified. Long survivors are characterized by younger age, better neurological status, and a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.

Although current treatment strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have achieved clinical effects and prolonged the survival of patients, the gradual development of resistance against current therapies has led to a high recurrence rate and treatment failure. Mechanisms underlying the development of resistance involve multiple factors, including drug efflux, DNA damage repair, glioma stem cells, and a hypoxic tumor environment, which are usually correlative and promote each other. As many potential therapeutic targets have been discovered, combination therapy that regulates multiple resistance-related molecule pathways is considered an attractive strategy. In recent years, nanomedicine has revolutionized cancer therapies with optimized accumulation, penetration, internalization, and controlled release. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration efficiency is also significantly improved through modifying ligands on nanomedicine and interacting with the receptors or transporters on the BBB.

Therefore, in order to better treat these tumors, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms which are responsible for this behavior. Previous work suggested that gap junction proteins, the connexins, facilitate the aggressive nature of glioma cells. Here, we show that one of them-connexin43 (Cx43)-is implicated in the formation and function of invadopodia responsible for invasion capacity of U251 human glioblastoma cells. Immunofluorescent approaches-combined with confocal analyses-revealed that Cx43 was detected in all the formation stages of invadopodia exhibiting proteolytic activity. Clearly, Cx43 appeared to be localized in invadopodia at low cell density and less associated with the establishment of gap junctions. Accordingly, lower extracellular matrix degradation correlated with less mature invadopodia and MMP2 activity when Cx43 expression was decreased by shRNA strategies. Moreover, the kinetics of invadopodia formation could be dependent on Cx43 dynamic interactions with partners including Src and cortactin. Interestingly, it also appeared that invadopodia formation and MMP2 activity are dependent on Cx43 hemichannel activity.

We examined 141 primary glioblastomas (pGBMs) and 25 secondary glioblastomas (sGBMs). NLRs, PLRs, and LMRs were calculated before surgery. IDH mutations were detected immunohistochemically after tumor resection, and patients' clinical outcomes were analyzed after classification into GBM, pGBM, and IDH-wild type glioblastoma (IDH-wt GBM) groups. To make comparisons, we set cutoffs for NLR, PLR and LMR of 4.0, 175.0, and 3.7, respectively.

Long- term/short-term survival-related DEGs were defined as those with increased/decreased expression values and survival time. The following DEGs were identified; 161 between intermediate and short-term glioblastomas, 465 between long-term and short-term and 624 between long-term and intermediate tumors. The common FLRT1 and LINGO1 up-regulated DEGs and common down-regulated C7orf31 were identified in these three DEG sets. PPI networks were established, and VEGFA was the key DEG in each PPI network. The short-term survival-related DEGs were enriched in 3 cancer-related pathways. Moreover, FLRT1 and LINGO1 were long-term survival-related DEGs and C7orf31 and VEGFA were short-term survival DEGs.

Methods: The French brain tumor database and the Club de Neuro-Oncologie of the Société Française de Neurochirurgie retrospectively identified adult patients with cerebellar glioblastoma diagnosed between 2003 and 2017. Diagnosis was confirmed by a centralized neuropathological review. Results: Data from 118 cerebellar glioblastoma patients were analyzed (mean age 55.9 years, 55.1% males). The clinical presentation associated raised intracranial pressure (50.8%), static cerebellar syndrome (68.6%), kinetic cerebellar syndrome (49.2%) and/or cranial nerve disorders (17.8%). Glioblastomas were hemispheric (55.9%), vermian (14.4%) or both (29.7%). Hydrocephalus was present in 49 patients (41.5%).

This opens up opportunities for new therapeutic strategies giving rise to the new research field of cancer neuroscience at the interface between oncology and neuroscience. It has been observed that glioblastomas as well as other incurable brain tumor entities, form multicellular tumor networks through long cell projections called tumor microtubes that are molecularly controlled by neuronal developmental mechanisms. These networks provide the tumor with efficient communication and resilience to external perturbations and are tumor-intrinsic continuously activated by pacemaker-like tumor cells. In addition, neuron-tumor networks have been discovered that also exploit direct glutamatergic synaptic contacts between nerve cells and tumor cells.

Areas of new CE were investigated by use of EPMR diffusion-weighted imaging and PAMR perfusion imaging (by arterial spin-labeling). PAMR was acquired, on average, 29.9 days later than EPMR (range 20-37 days). During this period an increased area of CE was observed for 17/37 patients. For 3/17 patients these regions were confined to areas of reduced EPMR diffusion, suggesting postsurgical infarct. For the other 14/17 patients, these areas suggested progression. For 11/17 patients the co-occurrence of hyperperfusion in PAMR perfusion suggested progression. PAMR perfusion and EPMR diffusion did not give consistent results for 3/17 patients for whom small new areas of CE were observed, presumably because of the poor spatial resolution of perfusion imaging.

"""An extent of resection threshold for recurrent glioblastoma and its risk for neurological morbidity.""","""Object: Despite improvements in the medical and surgical management of patients with glioblastoma, tumor recurrence remains inevitable. For recurrent glioblastoma, however, the clinical value of a second resection remains uncertain. Specifically, what proportion of contrast-enhancing recurrent glioblastoma tissue must be removed to improve overall survival and what is the neurological cost of incremental resection beyond this threshold? Methods: The authors identified 170 consecutive patients with recurrent supratentorial glioblastomas treated at the Barrow Neurological Institute from 2001 to 2011. All patients previously had a de novo glioblastoma and following their initial resection received standard temozolomide and fractionated radiotherapy. Results: The mean clinical follow-up was 22.6 months and no patient was lost to follow-up. At the time of recurrence, the median preoperative tumor volume was 26.1 cm(3). Following re-resection, median postoperative tumor volume was 3.1 cm(3), equating to an 87.4% extent of resection (EOR). The median overall survival was 19.0 months, with a median progression-free survival following re-resection of 5.2 months. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, the variables of age, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, and EOR were predictive of survival following repeat resection (p = 0.0001). Interestingly, a significant survival advantage was noted with as little as 80% EOR. Recursive partitioning analysis validated these findings and provided additional risk stratification at the highest levels of EOR. Overall, at 7 days after surgery, a deterioration in the NIH stroke scale score by 1 point or more was observed in 39.1% of patients with EOR ≥ 80% as compared with 16.7% for those with EOR < 80% (p = 0.0049). This disparity in neurological morbidity, however, did not endure beyond 30 days postoperatively (p = 0.1279). Conclusions: For recurrent glioblastomas, an improvement in overall survival can be attained beyond an 80% EOR. This survival benefit must be balanced against the risk of neurological morbidity, which does increase with more aggressive cytoreduction, but only in the early postoperative period. Interestingly, this putative EOR threshold closely approximates that reported for newly diagnosed glioblastomas, suggesting that for a subset of patients, the survival benefit of microsurgical resection does not diminish despite biological progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24484232

"""Genetic pathways to glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas, the most frequent and malignant human brain tumors, may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). These glioblastoma subtypes constitute distinct disease entities that affect patients of different ages and develop through different genetic pathways. Our recent population-based study in the Canton of Zürich, Switzerland, shows that primary glioblastomas develop in older patients (mean age, 62 years) and typically show LOH on chromosome 10q (69%) and other genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, p16INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients (mean, 45 years) and frequently show TP53 mutations (65%) and LOH 10q (63%). Common to both primary and secondary glioblastoma is LOH on 10q, distal to the PTEN locus; a putative suppressor gene at 10q25-qter may be responsible for the glioblastoma phenotype. Of the TP53 point mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57% were located in hotspot codons 248 and 273, while in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more widely distributed. Furthermore, G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites were more frequent in secondary than in primary glioblastomas (56% vs 30%). These data suggest that the TP53 mutations in these glioblastoma subtypes arise through different mechanisms. There is evidence that G:C-->A:T transition mutations at CpG sites in the TP53 gene are significantly more frequent in low-grade astrocytomas with promoter methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene than in those without methylation. This suggests that, in addition to deamination of 5-methylcytosine (the best known mechanism of formation of G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites), involvement of alkylating agents that produce O6-methylguanine or related adducts recognized by MGMT cannot be excluded in the pathway leading to secondary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15822813

Material: 11 giant cell glioblastomas and 16 non-giant cell glioblastomas were assessed with immunocytochemical staining for CD34. Method: Standard immunocytochemical techniques were used, to reflect the staining patterns likely to be seen in routine diagnostic practice. Positive staining refers to staining of neoplastic cells.

"""Glioblastomas: Hijacking Metabolism to Build a Flexible Shield for Therapy Resistance.""","""Significance: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most lethal tumors despite the almost exclusive localization to the brain. This is largely due to therapeutic resistance. Radiation and chemotherapy significantly increase the survival for GBM patients, however, GBMs always recur, and the median overall survival is just over a year. Proposed reasons for such intractable resistance to therapy are numerous and include tumor metabolism, in particular, the ability of tumor cells to reconfigure metabolic fluxes on demand (metabolic plasticity). Understanding how the hard-wired, oncogene-driven metabolic tendencies of GBMs intersect with flexible, context-induced metabolic rewiring promises to reveal novel approaches for combating therapy resistance. Recent Advances: Personalized genome-scale metabolic flux models have recently provided evidence that metabolic flexibility promotes radiation resistance in cancer and identified tumor redox metabolism as a major predictor for resistance to radiation therapy (RT). It was demonstrated that radioresistant tumors, including GBM, reroute metabolic fluxes to boost the levels of reducing factors of the cell, thus enhancing clearance of reactive oxygen species that are generated during RT and promoting survival. Critical Issues: The current body of knowledge from published studies strongly supports the notion that robust metabolic plasticity can act as a (flexible) shield against the cytotoxic effects of standard GBM therapies, thus driving therapy resistance. The limited understanding of the critical drivers of such metabolic plasticity hampers the rational design of effective combination therapies. Future Directions: Identifying and targeting regulators of metabolic plasticity, rather than specific metabolic pathways, in combination with standard-of-care treatments have the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

Lymphocytes were categorized as absent, present, or abundant in histopathologic images from 171 TCGA glioblastomas. Associations were examined between lymphocytes and histologic features, mutations, copy number alterations, CpG island methylator phenotype, transcriptional class, and survival. We validated histologic findings using CD3G gene expression. Results: We found a positive correlation between TILs and glioblastomas with gemistocytes, sarcomatous cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells. Lymphocytes were enriched in the mesenchymal transcriptional class and strongly associated with mutations in NF1 and RB1. These mutations are frequent in the mesenchymal class and characteristic of gemistocytic, sarcomatous, epithelioid, and giant cell histologies. Conversely, TILs were rare in glioblastomas with small cells and oligodendroglioma components. Lymphocytes were depleted in the classical transcriptional class and in EGF receptor (EGFR)-amplified and homozygous PTEN-deleted glioblastomas. These alterations are characteristic of glioblastomas with small cells and glioblastomas of the classical transcriptional class. No association with survival was shown. Conclusions: TILs were enriched in glioblastomas of the mesenchymal class, strongly associated with mutations in NF1 and RB1 and typical of histologies characterized by these mutations. Conversely, TILs were depleted in the classical class, EGFR-amplified, and homozygous PTEN-deleted tumors and rare in histologies characterized by these alterations.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23864165
"""STAT-1 expression in human glioblastoma and peritumoral tissue.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is a very aggressive brain tumour with poor prognosis despite radical surgery or radiotherapy. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are important elements in intracellular signalling and part of the JAK-STAT pathway. They are activated by growth factors and cytokines and translocate into the nucleus upon activation to exert their function as transcription factors. STAT-1 can be induced by interferons and has also been found to be important in sensitizing tumours to chemotherapeutic drugs. Materials and methods: Forty-six glioblastoma samples have been analysed for the expression of STAT-1 by immunohistochemistry. Results: In our study performed by immunohistochemistry, 22 out of 46 glioblastomas (48%) were strongly positive for staining with a STAT-1 antibody, 9 (20%) showed an intermediate reactivity, 8 (17%) low immunoreactivity, and 7 (15%) were completely negative. In the tumour tissue, STAT-1 expression was mostly localized in the cytoplasm. This location of STAT-1 suggests the predominant presence of an inactive form of STAT-1. Tumour giant cells were frequently strongly stained. Part of the peritumoral brain tissue showed strongly positively reactive glial cells. Interestingly, within the infiltration area strong STAT-1 expression was found in reactive astrocytes, glia, and particularly in microglial components. Conclusion: The expression of STAT-1 in the majority of glioblastomas, together with its documented role in apoptosis and in the action of chemotherapeutic drugs on tumour cell lines point to a possible function of this protein in the response of glioblastomas to chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18225539
"""The prognostic IDH1( R132 ) mutation is associated with reduced NADP+-dependent IDH activity in glioblastoma.""","""Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) occur at high frequency in gliomas and seem to be a prognostic factor for survival in glioblastoma patients. In our set of 98 glioblastoma patients, IDH1 ( R132 ) mutations were associated with improved survival of 1 year on average, after correcting for age and other variables with Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with IDH1 mutations were on average 17 years younger than patients without mutation. Mutated IDH1 has a gain of function to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate by NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, but it is unknown whether NADPH production in gliomas is affected by IDH1 mutations. We assessed the effect of IDH1 (R132 ) mutations on IDH-mediated NADPH production in glioblastomas in situ. Metabolic mapping and image analysis was applied to 51 glioblastoma samples of which 16 carried an IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. NADP+-dependent IDH activity was determined in comparison with activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and all other NADPH-producing dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The occurrence of IDH1 mutations correlated with approx. twofold diminished NADP+-dependent IDH activity, whereas activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and the other NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases was not affected in situ in glioblastoma. The total NADPH production capacity in glioblastoma was provided for 65% by IDH activity and the occurrence of IDH1 (R132 ) mutation reduced this capacity by 38%. It is concluded that NADPH production is hampered in glioblastoma with IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. Moreover, mutated IDH1 consumes rather than produces NADPH, thus likely lowering NADPH levels even further. The low NADPH levels may sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy, thus explaining the prolonged survival of patients with mutated glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20127344
"""Aberrant NF-kappaB activity is critical in focal necrosis formation of human glioblastoma by regulation of the expression of tissue factor.""","""Focal necrosis is a key pathologic feature that distinguishes glioblastoma from lower grade glioma. The presence of necrosis in a glioblastoma could promote its rapid growth and clinical progression. Focal necrosis of glioblastoma seems to be associated with thrombosis that result from hyper-coagulability. In the present study, we found that glioblastoma cells had a high level of constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity, which was directly correlated with necrosis in glioblastomas. We also found a direct correlation between NF-kappaB activity and the expression of tissue factor (TF), a potent procoagulant factor in gliomas. Inhibition of TF by an inhibitory antibody prevented the procoagulant activity of glioblastoma cells, indicating a TF-dependent mechanism. Blockade of NF-kappaB activation significantly inhibited TF expression and the procoagulant activity of glioblastoma cells in vitro. Blockade of NF-kappaB activation also significantly inhibited in vivo expression of TF, which was directly correlated with decreased necrosis formation and tumor growth of glioblastoma cells in nude mice. Collectively, these results suggest that elevated NF-kappaB activity in glioblastomas cells plays a critical role in necrosis formation of glioblastoma and that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in glioblastoma can suppress necrosis formation and progressive growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18575745
"""beta-catenin and Gli1 are prognostic markers in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common primary malignancies of the central nervous system, are highly aggressive and heterogeneous, and remain a dramatic therapeutic challenge. Markers mirroring the complex molecular profile of GBMs that are predictive of patient outcomes are needed to define novel multi-targeted treatment strategies. Resistance to current GBM therapies is partly due to a subpopulation of stem-like and other self-renewing cells (hereafter called glioma stem-like cancer cells, GSCC), which are therefore of key interest as therapeutic entry points. Wnt and Hedgehog are among the main pathways involved in GSCC renewal. β-catenin and Gli1 are markers of Wnt and Hedgehog activation respectively and both pathways are known to be altered in gliomas. To date, there are no investigations of Gli1 protein expression in GBM tissue, and recently a high expression of β-catenin has been found to have a poor prognostic impact in GBM patients in a study. We have therefore quantified the positivity for β-catenin, Gli1, as well as Ki-67, p53, and EGFR proteins on immunohistochemically-stained GBM sections from 106 patients in an investigation for potential predictive biomarkers. Correlation between these markers and survival was evaluated by pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficient and by bi-dimensional hierarchical clustering, followed by survival estimations using linear regression models and classification trees. We demonstrated that both β-catenin and, for the first time, Gli1 proteins are highly predictive markers of short survival, being found in 75 and 90% of the highly predictive trees, respectively, whereas Ki-67, p53 and EGFR were under 30% and thus, not considered as predictive. Our results indicate a role of β-catenin and Gli1 in GBM malignant behaviour, and suggest that inhibiting members of Wnt and Hedgehog pathways could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21321483
"""The need of radiotherapy optimization for glioblastomas considering immune responses.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common of malignant primary brain tumors and one of the tumors with the poorest prognosis for which the overall survival rate has not significantly improved despite recent advances in treatment techniques and therapeutic drugs. Since the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the immune response to tumors has attracted increasing attention. Treatments affecting the immune system have been attempted for various tumors, including glioblastomas, but little has been shown to be effective. It has been found that the reason for this is that glioblastomas have a high ability to evade attacks from the immune system, and that the lymphocyte depletion associated with treatment can reduce its immune function. Currently, research to elucidate the resistance of glioblastomas to the immune system and development of new immunotherapies are being vigorously carried out. Targeting of radiation therapy for glioblastomas varies among guidelines and clinical trials. Based on early reports, target definitions with wide margins are common, but there are also reports that narrowing the margins does not make a significant difference in treatment outcome. It has also been suggested that a large number of lymphocytes in the blood are irradiated by the irradiation treatment to a wide area in a large number of fractionations, which may reduce the immune function, and the blood is being recognized as an organ at risk. Recently, a randomized phase II trial comparing two types of target definition in radiotherapy for glioblastomas was conducted, and it was reported that the overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly better in a small irradiation field group. We review recent findings on the immune response and the immunotherapy to glioblastomas and the novel role of radiotherapy and propose the need to develop an optimal radiotherapy that takes radiation effects on the immune function into account.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37071249
"""Distinct transcription profiles of primary and secondary glioblastoma subgroups.""","""Glioblastomas are invasive and aggressive tumors of the brain, generally considered to arise from glial cells. A subset of these cancers develops from lower-grade gliomas and can thus be clinically classified as 'secondary,' whereas some glioblastomas occur with no prior evidence of a lower-grade tumor and can be clinically classified as 'primary.' Substantial genetic differences between these groups of glioblastomas have been identified previously. We used large-scale expression analyses to identify glioblastoma-associated genes (GAG) that are associated with a more malignant phenotype via comparison with lower-grade astrocytomas. We have further defined gene expression differences that distinguish primary and secondary glioblastomas. GAGs distinct to primary or secondary tumors provided information on the heterogeneous properties and apparently distinct oncogenic mechanisms of these tumors. Secondary GAGs primarily include mitotic cell cycle components, suggesting the loss of function in prominent cell cycle regulators, whereas primary GAGs highlight genes typical of a stromal response, suggesting the importance of extracellular signaling. Immunohistochemical staining of glioblastoma tissue arrays confirmed expression differences. These data highlight that the development of gene pathway-targeted therapies may need to be specifically tailored to each subtype of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16397228

We recruited a series of 67 IDH-mutant primary glioblastomas/astrocytoma IV without a prior low-grade astrocytoma and examined them using DNA-methylation profiling, targeted sequencing, RNA sequencing and TERT promoter sequencing, and correlated the molecular findings with clinical parameters. The median OS of 39.4 months of 64 cases and PFS of 25.9 months of 57 cases were better than the survival data of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and IDH-mutant secondary glioblastomas retrieved from datasets. The molecular features often seen in glioblastomas, such as EGFR amplification, combined +7/-10, and TERT promoter mutations were only observed in 6/53 (11.3%), 4/53 (7.5%), and 2/67 (3.0%) cases, respectively, and gene fusions were found only in two cases. The main mechanism for telomere maintenance appeared to be alternative lengthening of telomeres as ATRX mutation was found in 34/53 (64.2%) cases. In t-SNE analyses of DNA-methylation profiles, with an exceptional of one case, a majority of our cases clustered to IDH-mutant high-grade astrocytoma subclass (40/53; 75.5%) and the rest to IDH-mutant astrocytoma subclass (12/53; 22.6%). The latter was also enriched with G-CIMP high cases (12/12; 100%). G-CIMP-high status and MGMT promoter methylation were independent good prognosticators for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.002, respectively) and TP53 mutation was an independent poor prognosticator (p = 0.013) when correlated with other clinical parameters. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B was not correlated with OS (p = 0.197) and PFS (p = 0.278). PDGFRA amplification or mutation was found in 16/59 (27.1%) of cases and was correlated with G-CIMP-low status (p = 0.010). Aside from the three well-known pathways of pathogenesis in glioblastomas, chromatin modifying and mismatch repair pathways were common aberrations (88.7% and 20.8%, respectively), the former due to high frequency of ATRX involvement. We conclude that IDH-mutant primary glioblastomas have better prognosis than secondary glioblastomas and have major molecular differences from other commoner glioblastomas.

"""Characterisation of the tumour microenvironment in primary and recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Aims: Glioblastoma patients have a dismal prognosis, due to inevitable tumour recurrence and respond poorly to immunotherapy. Tumour-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) dominate the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment and have been implicated in tumour progression and immune evasion. Early recurrent glioblastomas contain focal reactive regions with occasional fibrosis, chronic inflammation, TAMs and tumour cells. Surgical specimens from these tumours are rare and provide crucial insights into glioblastoma recurrence biology. This study aimed to characterise TAM- and lymphocyte phenotypes in primary vs early- and late-recurrent glioblastomas. Methods: Patient-matched primary and recurrent glioblastomas were compared between patients with early recurrences (n = 11, recurrence ≤6 months) and late recurrences (n = 12, recurrence after 12-19 months). Double-immunofluorescence stains combining Iba1 with HLA-DR, CD14, CD68, CD74, CD86, CD163, CD204 and CD206 along with stains for CD20, CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 were quantified with software-based classifiers. Results: Reactive regions in early recurrent tumours contained more TAMs (31.4% vs 21.7%, P = 0.01), which showed increased expression of CD86 (59.4% vs 38.4%, P = 0.04), CD204 (48.5% vs 28.4%, P = 0.03), CD206 (25.5% vs 14.4%, P = 0.04) and increased staining intensity for CD163 (86.4 vs 57.7 arbitrary units, P = 0.02), compared to late recurring tumours. Reactive regions contained more B-lymphocytes compared to patient-matched primary tumours (0.71% vs 0.40%, P = 0.04). Fractions of total, cytotoxic and regulatory T-lymphocytes did not differ. Conclusions: Early recurrent glioblastomas showed enrichment for TAMs, expressing both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers and B-lymphocytes.

"""Bioengineered Bacteriophage-Like Nanoparticles as RNAi Therapeutics to Enhance Radiotherapy against Glioblastomas.""","""Since glioblastomas (GBMs) are radioresistant malignancies and most GBM recurrences occur in radiotherapy, increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy by gene-silencing has recently attracted attention. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and RNA loading in nanoparticles leads to batch-to-batch variations of the RNA therapeutics, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Here, we bioengineer bacteriophage Qβ particles with a designed broccoli light-up three-way junction (b-3WJ) RNA scaffold (contains two siRNA/miRNA sequences and one light-up aptamer) packaging for the silencing of genes in radioresistant GBM cells. The in vitro results demonstrate that the cleavage of de novo designed b-3WJ RNA by Dicer enzyme can be easily monitored in real-time using fluorescence microscopy, and the TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR successfully knocks down EGFR and IKKα simultaneously and thereby inactivates NF-κB signaling to inhibit DNA repair. Delivery of TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR through convection-enhanced delivery (CED) infusion followed by 2Gy X-ray irradiation demonstrated that the median survival was prolonged to over 60 days compared with the 2Gy X-ray irradiated group (median survival: 31 days). Altogether, the results of this study could be critical for the design of RNAi-based genetic therapeutics, and CED infusion serves as a powerful delivery system for promoting radiotherapy against GBMs without evidence of systemic toxicity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120837

Both patients presented with new-onset seizures (simple partial and generalized). Their neurological examinations were unremarkable. Initial MRI evaluations revealed a right precentral gyrus and right medial temporal lobe lesions in each case, respectively. These lesions demonstrated increased T2 signal changes without contrast enhancement. The biopsy of the right frontal lesion in the first patient was consistent with an anaplastic astrocytoma; the second patient was followed expectantly. Repeat MRI for both patients within 17 weeks disclosed ring-enhancing lesions, consistent with an unusually rapid evolution to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Subsequent resection of the right medial temporal lesion in the second patient revealed a GBM. Neither tumor displayed abnormal overexpression of P53 by immunohistochemistry. Early MRI of de novo glioblastomas may demonstrate a non-enhancing tumor suggestive of a low-grade lesion.

"""Classification of microvascular patterns via cluster analysis reveals their prognostic significance in glioblastoma.""","""There are limited researches focusing on microvascular patterns (MVPs) in human glioblastoma and their prognostic impact. We evaluated MVPs of 78 glioblastomas by CD34/periodic acid-Schiff dual staining and by cluster analysis of the percentage of microvascular area for distinct microvascular formations. The distribution of 5 types of basic microvascular formations, that is, microvascular sprouting (MS), vascular cluster (VC), vascular garland (VG), glomeruloid vascular proliferation (GVP), and vasculogenic mimicry (VM), was variable. Accordingly, cluster analysis classified MVPs into 2 types: type I MVP displayed prominent MSs and VCs, whereas type II MVP had numerous VGs, GVPs, and VMs. By analyzing the proportion of microvascular area for each type of formation, we determined that glioblastomas with few MSs and VCs had many GVPs and VMs, and vice versa. VG seemed to be a transitional type of formation. In case of type I MVP, expression of Ki-67 and p53 but not MGMT was significantly higher as compared with those of type II MVP (P < .05). Survival analysis showed that the type of MVPs presented as an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (both P < .001). Type II MVP had a more negative influence on PFS and OS than did type I MVP.

We report results gained by investigating mitochondrial OxPhos and bioenergetics, in a model of three human glioblastoma cell lines characterized by a different PTEN gene status. Functional data are analysed in relation to the expression levels of some main transcription factors and signalling proteins, which can be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. Collectively, our observations indicate for the three cell lines a similar bioenergetic phenotype maintaining a certain degree of mitochondrial oxidative activity, with some difference for PTEN-wild type SF767 cells respect to PTEN-deleted A172 and U87MG characterized by a loss-of-function point mutation of PTEN. SF767 has lower ATP content and higher ADP/ATP ratio, higher AMPK activating-phosphorylation evoking energy impairment, higher OxPhos complexes and PGC1α-Sirt3-p53 protein abundance, in line with a higher respiration. Finally, SF767 shows a similar mitochondrial energy supply, but higher non-phosphorylating respiration linked to dissipation of protonmotive force.

Pre-operative MRIs of patients with a new diagnosis of glioblastoma were reviewed. Tumours with >33% nCET were sub-classified by the dominant morphologic pattern of nCET: mass-like expansion, white matter dissemination, grey matter dissemination or a combination. IDH1 mutation status (by immunohistochemistry) and survival were compared for each pattern. 153 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 34 patients demonstrated >33% nCET. 10 patients had a significant mass-like component, either as the dominant pattern (n=4) or as part of a mixed pattern (n=6). The 10 patients with a significant mass-like component had longer survival than those without (median 387days, compared to 241days), though this was not statistically significant (p=0.242). Three patients had R132H-IDH1 mutations and >33% nCET, and all three had a mass-like component. Using the presence of a mass-like component of nCET for predicting IDH1 mutation status improved the positive predictive value, specificity and overall accuracy of MRI.

The probe, ICG-PEP-c(RGD)fk, consisted of a glutathione-reactive self-assembling polypeptide as the skeleton, indocyanine green (ICG) as a theranostic agent, and cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp [c(RGD)fk] peptides as the targeting group. ICG-PEP-c(RGD)fk was synthesized and found to be assembled in the glutathione environment at 9.446 μM in vitro. Human glioblastoma cell line U87MG-luc with high integrin αvβ3 expression was applied to invivo experiments. ICG-PEP-c(RGD)fk provided clearer tumor imaging and had a tumor retention time of 6.12 times longer than that of ICG-c(RGD)fk. In therapeutic experiments, ICG-PEP-c(RGD)fk significantly suppressed glioblastoma growth and the tumor volume was 2.61 times smaller than in the ICG-c(RGD)fk group at the end of the observation period. Moreover, the median survival time of ICG-PEP-c(RGD)fk group was significantly improved by 2.78 times compared with that of the control group.

"""Marked genomic differences characterize primary and secondary glioblastoma subtypes and identify two distinct molecular and clinical secondary glioblastoma entities.""","""Glioblastoma is classified into two subtypes on the basis of clinical history: 'primary glioblastoma' arising de novo without detectable antecedent disease and 'secondary glioblastoma' evolving from a low-grade astrocytoma. Despite their distinctive clinical courses, they arrive at an indistinguishable clinical and pathologic end point highlighted by widespread invasion and resistance to therapy and, as such, are managed clinically as if they are one disease entity. Because the life history of a cancer cell is often reflected in the pattern of genomic alterations, we sought to determine whether primary and secondary glioblastomas evolve through similar or different molecular pathogenetic routes. Clinically annotated primary and secondary glioblastoma samples were subjected to high-resolution copy number analysis using oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization. Unsupervised classification using genomic nonnegative matrix factorization methods identified three distinct genomic subclasses. Whereas one corresponded to clinically defined primary glioblastomas, the remaining two stratified secondary glioblastoma into two genetically distinct cohorts. Thus, this global genomic analysis showed wide-scale differences between primary and secondary glioblastomas that were previously unappreciated, and has shown for the first time that secondary glioblastoma is heterogeneous in its molecular pathogenesis. Consistent with these findings, analysis of regional recurrent copy number alterations revealed many more events unique to these subclasses than shared. The pathobiological significance of these shared and subtype-specific copy number alterations is reinforced by their frequent occurrence, resident genes with clear links to cancer, recurrence in diverse cancer types, and apparent association with clinical outcome. We conclude that glioblastoma is composed of at least three distinct molecular subtypes, including novel subgroups of secondary glioblastoma, which may benefit from different therapeutic strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17114236

To evaluate the potential for p53 gene therapy of glioblastoma, we have analyzed the response of human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo to experimental therapy with replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type p53 (rAd-p53). Western blot analyses showed high-level expression of p53 protein after treatment with rAd-p53, and transgene expression was dependent on promoter strength. A p53-specific dose-dependent inhibition of in vitro cellular proliferation was observed in 5 of 6 cell lines, and growth inhibition corresponded to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and expression. p53-specific cell death was quantitated by release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Fragmentation of DNA into nucleosomal oligomers and the occurrence of a hypodiploid cell population detected by flow cytometry provided evidence for apoptosis. Studies in nude mice demonstrated that ex vivo infection with rAd-p53 suppressed the tumorigenic potential of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, direct injection of rAd-p53 into established s.c. xenografts inhibited tumor growth.

HGF also mediates migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to sites of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, MSC show tropism for glioblastomas, which is exploited in gene therapy to deliver the therapeutics to the tumor cells. Here, we have studied whether HGF contributes to the recruitment of MSC by glioblastoma cells and whether aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (ALA/PDT), a novel therapeutic approach that induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, affects HGF release and this migratory response. MSC expressed the HGF receptor MET and migrated towards U87 and U251 glioblastoma spheroids. Migration increased significantly when spheroids were subjected to ALA/PDT, which was associated with induction of apoptosis and up-regulation of HGF. Neutralizing HGF resulted in significant inhibition of MSC migration towards untreated as well as ALA/PDT-treated spheroids. Thus, glioblastoma cells express HGF, which contributes to the attraction of MSC. ALA/PDT induces apoptosis and augments HGF release causing enhanced MSC migration towards the tumor cells. ALA/PDT may therefore be exploited to improve targeting of MSC delivered gene therapy, but it may also constitute a risk in terms of beneficial effects for the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333382

In one group of three cases, multifocal glioblastomas appeared to be emerging in the background of a better differentiated, and presumably precursory, astrocytic neoplasm. In another group of nine cases, the neoplasms were more intimate mixtures of well and poorly differentiated cells. The third group of five cases was composed of neoplasms that were largely undifferentiated without a component of better differentiated cells. The study suggests that progression from a better differentiated neoplasm to one composed largely of undifferentiated cells is common in the fibrillary astrocytic neoplasms. Although some glioblastomas appear largely undifferentiated and consistent with the de novo appearance of overt malignancy, the size of these neoplasms and the patterns of necrosis leave open the possibility that a preexisting better differentiated neoplasm had been obliterated by necrosis and the overgrowth of the anaplastic component. The potential topographic variation of cellular constituency in a glioblastoma underscores the care that must be exercised in utilization of the needle biopsy technique in the diagnosis and grading of astrocytic neoplasms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2539242
"""Correlation among pathology, genotype, and patient outcomes in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are histologically and genetically heterogeneous. We have investigated to what extent histologic features reflect the genetic profile and whether they are predictive of clinical outcome. Key histologic characteristics, including major cell types (small cell, nonsmall cell), other components such as oligodendroglial components, gemistocytes, multinucleated giant cells, as well as necrosis and microvascular proliferation, of 420 cases of glioblastoma within a population-based study (1) were reassessed and correlated with patients' clinical outcome and key genetic alterations. EGFR amplification and p16 homozygous deletion were significantly more frequent in small cell glioblastomas than in nonsmall cell glioblastomas (EGFR, 46% vs 26%, p = 0.0002; p16 39% vs 25%, p = 0.0167). Multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender showed that small cell glioblastomas had frequent EGFR amplification and p16 deletion but infrequent PTEN mutations. An oligodendroglial component was detected in 20% of glioblastomas; these patients were significantly younger (54.4 +/- 13.6 vs 59.2 +/- 13.8 years; p = 0.0049) and survived longer (10.3 +/- 8.3 vs 8.2 +/- 8.4 months; p = 0.0647). However, multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender did not show the presence of an oligodendroglial component to be predictive of longer survival. After adjustment for age and gender, LOH 1p was associated with longer survival (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.0), whereas LOH 10q was associated with shorter survival (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8) of patients with glioblastoma. Glioblastomas containing >or=5% multinucleated giant cells showed more frequent TP53 mutation and infrequent EGFR amplification than those containing <5% multinucleated giant cells (TP53, 45% vs 24%, p = 0.0001; EGFR, 24% vs 42%, p = 0.0005). Vascular proliferation was observed in all glioblastomas, whereas large ischemic and/or pseudopalisading necrosis was observed in 366 of 420 (87%) cases. Glioblastomas with necrosis were associated with older age (59.2 +/- 13.3 vs 51.6 +/- 15.3 years; p = 0.0001) and shorter survival (7.9 +/- 6.8 vs 12.9 +/- 14.2 months; p = 0.0017). Multivariate analyses with adjustment for age and gender confirmed this observation (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0). Multivariate analysis with adjustment for age and gender showed that necrosis was significantly associated with wild-type TP53 and absence of an oligodendroglial component. These results suggest that some histologic features in glioblastomas are associated with specific genetic alterations and with clinical outcome.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16957578

"""Location of subventricular zone recurrence and its radiation dose predicts survival in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors that frequently recur in the subventricular zone (SVZ) despite maximal treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate imaging patterns of subventricular progression and impact of recurrent subventricular tumor involvement and radiation dose to patient outcome. Retrospective review of 50 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and treated with surgery, radiation, and concurrent temozolomide from January 2012 to June 2013 was performed. Tumors were classified based on location, size, and cortical and subventricular zone involvement. Survival was compared based on recurrence type, distance from the initial enhancing tumor (local ≤ 2 cm, distant > 2 cm), and the radiation dose at the recurrence site. Progression of enhancing subventricular tumor was common at both local (58%) and distant (42%) sites. Median survival was better after local SVZ recurrence than distant SVZ recurrence (8.7 vs. 4.3 months, p = 0.04). Radiation doses at local SVZ recurrence sites recurrence averaged 57.0 ± 4.0 Gy compared to 44.7 ± 6.7 Gy at distant SVZ recurrence sites (p = 0.008). Distant subventricular progression at a site receiving ≤ 45 Gy predicted worse subsequent survival (p = 0.05). Glioblastomas frequently recurred in the subventricular zone, and patient survival was worse when enhancing tumor occurred at sites that received lower radiation doses. This recurrent disease may represent disease undertreated at the time of diagnosis, and further study is needed to determine if improved treatment strategies, such as including the subventricular zone in radiation fields, could improve clinical outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29546530
"""Matrix gla protein (MGP): an overexpressed and migration-promoting mesenchymal component in glioblastoma.""","""Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that a molecular subtype of glioblastoma is characterized by overexpression of extracellular matrix (ECM)/mesenchymal components and shorter survival. Specifically, gene expression profiling studies revealed that matrix gla protein (MGP), whose function has traditionally been linked to inhibition of calcification of arteries and cartilage, is overexpressed in glioblastomas and associated with worse outcome. Methods: In order to analyze the role of MGP in glioblastomas, we performed expression, migration and proliferation studies. Results: Real-time PCR and ELISA assays confirmed overexpression of MGP in glioblastoma biopsy specimens and cell lines at mRNA and protein levels as compared to normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry verified positivity of glial tumor cells for MGP. RNAi-mediated knockdown of MGP in three glioma cell lines (U343MG, U373MG, H4) led to marked reduction of migration, as demonstrated by wound healing and transwell assays, while no effect on proliferation was seen. Conclusion: Our data suggest that upregulation of MGP (and possibly other ECM-related components as well) results in unfavorable prognosis via increased migration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19712474
"""Immunogenomics of Hypermutated Glioblastoma: A Patient with Germline POLE Deficiency Treated with Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy.""","""We present the case of a patient with a left frontal glioblastoma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor features and hypermutated genotype in the setting of a POLE germline alteration. During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. Significance: It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults. Herein, we provide proof of principle that glioblastomas with DNA-repair defects treated with checkpoint blockade may result in CNS immune activation, leading to clinically and immunologically significant responses. These patients may represent a genomically stratified group for whom immunotherapy could be considered.

"""Impact of genotype and morphology on the prognosis of glioblastoma.""","""The recognition of molecular subsets among glioblastomas has raised the question whether distinct mutations in glioblastoma-associated genes may serve as prognostic markers. The present study on glioblastomas (GBM) from 97 consecutively sampled adult patients is based on a clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analysis. Parameters assessed were age at diagnosis, survival, cell type, proliferation, necrosis, microvascular proliferation, sarcomatous growth, lymphocytic infiltration, thromboses, calcifications, GFAP expression, MIB-1 index, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the chromosomal arms 1p, 10p, 10q, 17p, 19q and structural alterations in the TP53, EGFR and PTEN genes. As in previous studies, younger age was significantly associated with better survival. Among the molecular parameters, TP53 mutations and LOH10q emerged as favorable and poor prognostic factors, respectively. TP53 mutations were a favorable prognostic factor independent of whether glioblastomas were primary or secondary. LOH1p or 19q, lesions suspected to be over-represented in long term survivors with malignant glioma, were not associated with better survival. However, the combination of LOH1p and LOH19q defined GBM patients with a significantly better survival. Notably, these patients did not exhibit morphological features reminiscent of oligodendroglioma.

"""The value of extent of resection of glioblastomas: clinical evidence and current approach.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM), one of the most common tumors of the central nervous system, are associated with poor prognosis, even with all the scientific development of the last decades. Individual survival, however, is not homogenous among GBM patients, and multiple factors are related to their outcome, including age, biological characteristics of the tumor, and extent of treatment. Extent of resection (EOR) plays a major role as an independent modifiable factor associated with improved overall and progression-free survival. Achievement of maximal safe resection, removing as much as possible the tumor while preserving the neurological function, is the main goal of the current surgical treatment of GBM. To reach this objective, different technologies and surgical techniques have been introduced in neuro-oncology surgery, including functional neuronavigation systems, ultrasound surgery, intraoperative MRI scan, and intraoperative cortical and subcortical mapping techniques. In the current manuscript, we examine the impact of EOR on the prognosis of GBM patients and the benefits and limitations of modern adjuvant techniques used for resection of these lesions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25467408

Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left parietooccipital tumor with ring enhancement. Digital subtraction angiography revealed an extreme high-flow arteriovenous shunt.

"""Automatic Analysis of Cellularity in Glioblastoma and Correlation with ADC Using Trajectory Analysis and Automatic Nuclei Counting.""","""Objective: Several studies have analyzed a correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI and the tumor cellularity of corresponding histopathological specimens in brain tumors with inconclusive findings. Here, we compared a large dataset of ADC and cellularity values of stereotactic biopsies of glioblastoma patients using a new postprocessing approach including trajectory analysis and automatic nuclei counting. Materials and methods: Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were enrolled in this study. ADC maps were acquired preoperatively at 3T and coregistered to the intraoperative MRI that contained the coordinates of the biopsy trajectory. 561 biopsy specimens were obtained; corresponding cellularity was calculated by semi-automatic nuclei counting and correlated to the respective preoperative ADC values along the stereotactic biopsy trajectory which included areas of T1-contrast-enhancement and necrosis. Results: There was a weak to moderate inverse correlation between ADC and cellularity in glioblastomas that varied depending on the approach towards statistical analysis: for mean values per patient, Spearman's ρ = -0.48 (p = 0.002), for all trajectory values in one joint analysis Spearman's ρ = -0.32 (p < 0.001). The inverse correlation was additionally verified by a linear mixed model. Conclusions: Our data confirms a previously reported inverse correlation between ADC and tumor cellularity. However, the correlation in the current article is weaker than the pooled correlation of comparable previous studies.

"""Molecular advances of brain tumors in radiation oncology.""","""Glioblastoma, grade IV malignant glioma based on the World Health Organization classification, is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. The average survival time of less than 1 year has not improved notably over the last 3 decades. Surgery and radiotherapy, the traditional cornerstones of therapy, provide palliative benefit, whereas the value of chemotherapy has been marginal and controversial. The dismal prognosis of glioblastoma patients is largely caused by the striking radioresistance of these tumors. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the malignant phenotype of glioblastomas and plausible mechanisms of radiation resistance can provide new possibilities in terms of targeted therapeutic strategies. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of malignant gliomas, common aberrations in the signaling elements of the growth and survival pathways are found. New treatments have emerged to target molecules in these signaling pathways with the goal to increase specific efficacy and minimize toxicity. Monoclonal antibodies and low molecular-weight kinase inhibitors are the most common classes of agents in targeted cancer treatment. This review introduces these new targeted therapies in the context of current treatment options for patients with glioblastoma. It is hoped that this combined approach will overcome the current limitations in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma and result in a better prognosis for these patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19464632
"""Residual Tumor Volume, Cell Volume Fraction, and Tumor Cell Kill During Fractionated Chemoradiation Therapy of Human Glioblastoma using Quantitative Sodium MR Imaging.""","""Purpose: Spatial and temporal patterns of response of human glioblastoma to fractionated chemoradiation are described by changes in the bioscales of residual tumor volume (RTV), tumor cell volume fraction (CVF), and tumor cell kill (TCK), as derived from tissue sodium concentration (TSC) measured by quantitative sodium MRI at 3 Tesla. These near real-time patterns during treatment are compared with overall survival. Experimental design: Bioscales were mapped during fractionated chemoradiation therapy in patients with glioblastomas (n = 20) using TSC obtained from serial quantitative sodium MRI at 3 Tesla and a two-compartment model of tissue sodium distribution. The responses of these parameters in newly diagnosed human glioblastomas undergoing treatment were compared with time-to-disease progression and survival. Results: RTV following tumor resection showed decreased CVF due to disruption of normal cell packing by edema and infiltrating tumor cells. CVF showed either increases back toward normal as infiltrating tumor cells were killed, or decreases as cancer cells continued to infiltrate and extend tumor margins. These highly variable tumor responses showed no correlation with time-to-progression or overall survival. Conclusions: These bioscales indicate that fractionated chemoradiotherapy of glioblastomas produces variable responses with low cell killing efficiency. These parameters are sensitive to real-time changes within the treatment volume while remaining stable elsewhere, highlighting the potential to individualize therapy earlier in management, should alternative strategies be available.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30487127

The aim of this study is to characterize pGBM and sGBM associating with differential molecular subtype distribution. Whole transcriptome sequencing data was used to assess the distribution of molecular subtypes and genetic alterations in 88 pGBM and 34 sGBM in a Chinese population-based cohort, and the biological progression and prognostic impact were analyzed by combining clinical information. Forty-one percentage of pGBM were designated as Mesenchymal subtype, while only 15% were the Proneural subtype. However, sGBM displayed the opposite ratio of Mesenchymal (15%) and Proneural (44%) subtypes. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) were found to be highly concentrated in the Proneural subtypes. In addition, patients with sGBM were 10 years younger on average than those with pGBM, and exhibited clinical features of shorter overall survival and frontal lobe tumor location tendency. Furthermore, in sGBM, gene sets related to malignant progression were found to be enriched. Overall, these results reveal the intrinsic distinction between pGBM and sGBM, and provide insight into the genetic and clinical attributes of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25821160
"""Novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to malignant glioma.""","""Glioblastomas (World Health Organisation (WHO) grade IV) and anaplastic gliomas (astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas) (WHO grade III) are collectively referred to as malignant gliomas. The diagnosis of malignant glioma may be suspected based on clinical history and neuroimaging findings, but histological confirmation remains the diagnostic 'gold standard'. Molecular markers such as 1p/19q codeletion and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. O-methylguanylmethyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is another favourable prognostic marker and predicts benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy in glioblastoma. Additionally, the extent of neurosurgical resection is a prognostic factor. Radiotherapy of the involved brain region or chemotherapy using the alkylating agent, temozolomide, are common therapeutic options for patients with anaplastic glioma. In contrast, temozolomide plus radiotherapy is the standard of care for most patients with glioblastoma. The increasing population of elderly patients with glioblastoma represents a particular challenge, with surgery followed by radiotherapy as the standard of care. Contemporary clinical studies focus on the role of angiogenesis. Specifically, pivotal phase III studies exploring the antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bevacizumab, and the αvβ3/5 antagonist, cilengitide, in the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma have completed enrolment.

"""Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics predict epidermal growth factor receptor amplification status in glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Two clinical-molecular glioblastoma subtypes have been described: 'primary' glioblastomas arise de novo in older patients and often overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); 'secondary' glioblastomas progress from lower-grade tumors in younger patients and commonly have TP53 mutations. EGFR overexpression correlates in experimental gliomas with increased angiogenesis, edema, and invasion. No radiographic predictors of molecular glioblastoma subtype are known. Experimental design: We retrospectively reviewed 75 glioblastomas, classified as TP53-mutated (n=11), EGFR-amplified (n=31), or neither (non-TP53/non-EGFR; n=33). Four variables were derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging: (a) T2/T1, the ratio of T2-bright volume to enclosed T1-enhancing volume; (b) percentage of tumor volume that was necrosis; and (c and d) T1 and T2 border sharpness coefficients (BSC), the rates of change in grayscale intensity of adjacent 0.02-cm2 voxels traversing the anterior, posterior, and lateral borders on T1-enhanced and T2 images. Results and conclusions: Mean T2/T1 was 4.7 for EGFR-amplified glioblastomas, greater than that of TP53-mutated glioblastomas (2.3) or non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (2.6; P<0.00005). All four tumors with T2/T1>7.2 were EGFR-amplified; 0 of 15 with T2/T1<4.7 underwent gross total resection. The mean T2 BSC of EGFR-amplified glioblastomas was 33.7, less sharp (P<0.0000005) than TP53-mutated (72.2) and non-TP53/non-EGFR glioblastomas (81.2). All 15 glioblastomas with T2 BSC<30.8 were EGFR-amplified. Percentage necrosis and T1 BSC did not differ between glioblastoma subtypes. The increased T2/T1 ratio and decreased T2 BSC in EGFR-overexpressing tumors are the first radiographic distinctions described between glioblastoma molecular subtypes.

"""A molecular genetic model of astrocytoma histopathology.""","""As the molecular events responsible for astrocytoma formation and progression are being clarified, it is becoming possible to correlate these alterations with the specific histopathological and biological features of astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In WHO grade II astrocytomas, autocrine stimulation by the plateletderived growth factor system coupled with inactivation of the p53 gene may lead to a growth stimulus in the face of decreased cell death with slow net growth ensuing. Such cells would also have defective responses to DNA damage and impaired DNA repair, setting the stage for future malignant change. Such biological scenarios recapitulate many of the clinicopathological features of WHO grade II astrocytomas. Anaplastic astrocytomas further display release of a critical cell cycle brake that involves the CDKN2/p16, RB and CDK4 genes. This results in mitoses seen histologically; clinically, there is more conspicuous, rapid growth. Finally, glioblastomas may emerge from the microenvironmental outgrowth of more malignant clones in a complex vicious cycle that involves necrosis, hypoxia, growth factor release, angiogenesis and clonal selection; growth signals mediated by activation of epidermal growth factor receptors may precipitate glioblastomas. It is clear as well that glioblastoma multiforme can arise via a number of independent genetic pathways, although the clinical significance of these distinctions remains unclear.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9161727

We aimed to evaluate the significance of CatS in human astrocytoma progression and as a prognostic marker. Frozen tissue homogenates from 71 patients with astrocytomas and 3 normal brain specimens were subjected to ELISA analyses. Immunohistochemical analysis of CatS expression was performed on 126 paraffin-embedded tumour samples. Fifty-one astrocytoma cases were suitable for both frozen tissue and paraffin tissue analysis. ELISA revealed minimal expression of CatS in normal brain homogenates. CatS expression was increased in grade IV tumours whereas astrocytoma grades I-III exhibited lower values. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a similar pattern of expression. Moreover, high-CatS immunohistochemical scores in glioblastomas were associated with significantly shorter survival (10 vs. 5 months, p = 0.014). With forced inclusion of patient age, radiation dose and Karnofsky score in the Cox multivariate model, CatS score was found to be an independent predictor of survival. CatS expression in astrocytomas is associated with tumour progression and poor outcome in glioblastomas.

"""Evodiamine, a plant alkaloid, induces calcium/JNK-mediated autophagy and calcium/mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastomas, the most common primary gliomas, are characterized by increased invasion and difficult therapy. Major clinical medicines for treating gliomas merely extend the survival time for a number of months. Therefore, development of new agents against gliomas is important. Autophagy, a process for degrading damaged organelles and proteins, is an adaptive response to environmental stress. However, the role of autophagy in glioblastoma development still needs to be further investigated. Evodiamine, a major alkaloid isolated from Evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, has various pharmacological activities, such as inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic properties. However, the effects of evodiamine on glioblastomas and their detailed molecular mechanisms and autophagy formation are not well understood. In this study, we observed that evodiamine induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in glioma cells. Blockade of calcium channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) significantly reduced evodiamine-induced cytosolic calcium elevation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial depolarization, which suggests that evodiamine induces a calcium-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, autophagy was also enhanced by evodiamine, and had reached a plateau by 24h. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Inhibition of ER calcium channel activation also significantly reduced evodiamine-induced autophagy. Inactivation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) suppressed evodiamine-mediated autophagy accompanied by increased apoptosis. Furthermore, evodiamine-mediated JNK activation was abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium scavenger, suggesting that evodiamine mediates autophagy via a calcium-JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that evodiamine induces intracellular calcium/JNK signaling-mediated autophagy and calcium/mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774672
"""Immunohistochemical analysis of giant cell glioblastoma.""","""Giant cell glioblastoma (GCG) is one of a group of rare tumors in which the cell population is abnormally large and includes multinucleated cells of gigantic sizes. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on four GCG cases and found that all giant cells and/or tumor cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein, and vimentin, thus verifying the tumor's glial origin. The nuclei of multinucleated giant cells of three adult cases were frequently immunostained for proteins expressed during the cell cycle (proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67), thereby demonstrating the proliferative capacity of these cells. By contrast, those of a 12 year old girl expressed these cell cycle markers rather infrequently. Alpha I-antitrypsin was detected with relatively high frequency in the giant cells, and its presence may explain their bizarre sizes and pericellular reticulin fiber formation. A literature review of 32 cases revealed that the GCG that occurs preferentially in young girls is a type of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. By contrast, GCG in adult males has the same age incidence as ordinary glioblastomas and, as these, expresses high levels of cell cycle-related proteins. Thus, GCG, which is subclassified morphologically as ordinary glioblastoma, has distinct biological and clinical characteristics, with that in children requiring re-evaluation because of its similarities to pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7550996
"""Diagnostic implications of IDH1-R132H and OLIG2 expression patterns in rare and challenging glioblastoma variants.""","""Recent work has demonstrated that nearly all diffuse gliomas display nuclear immunoreactivity for the bHLH transcription factor OLIG2, and the R132H mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) protein is expressed in the majority of diffuse gliomas other than primary glioblastoma. However, these antibodies have not been widely applied to rarer glioblastoma variants, which can be diagnostically challenging when the astrocytic features are subtle. We therefore surveyed the expression patterns of OLIG2 and IDH1 in 167 non-conventional glioblastomas, including 45 small cell glioblastomas, 45 gliosarcomas, 34 glioblastomas with primitive neuroectodermal tumor-like foci (PNET-like foci), 23 with an oligodendroglial component, 11 granular cell glioblastomas, and 9 giant cell glioblastomas. OLIG2 was strongly expressed in all glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component, 98% of small cell glioblastomas, and all granular cell glioblastomas, the latter being particularly helpful in ruling out macrophage-rich lesions. In 74% of glioblastomas with PNET-like foci, OLIG2 expression was retained in the PNET-like foci, providing a useful distinction from central nervous system PNETs. The glial component of gliosarcomas was OLIG2 positive in 93% of cases, but only 14% retained focal expression in the sarcomatous component; as such this marker would not reliably distinguish these from pure sarcoma in most cases. OLIG2 was expressed in 67% of giant cell glioblastomas. IDH1 was expressed in 55% of glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component, 15% of glioblastomas with PNET-like foci, 7% of gliosarcomas, and none of the small cell, granular cell, or giant cell glioblastomas. This provides further support for the notion that most glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component are secondary, while small cell glioblastomas, granular cell glioblastomas, and giant cell glioblastomas are primary variants. Therefore, in one of the most challenging differential diagnoses, IDH1 positivity could provide strong support for glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, while essentially excluding small cell glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23041832

The majority of the patients were young adults (mean age 34.8 years), presenting with a short duration of symptoms of 2 months or less. Their histopathological features were similar to cerebral glioblastoma. Diverse vascular changes like microvascular proliferation, sprouting angiogenesis, sclerosed and thrombosed vessels, along with field necrosis were prominent findings. All tumors were positive for GFAP and negative for EMA. The MIB-1 labeling index was very high (mean 16.7 ± 3.2%). Five out of six tumors were immunoreactive for p53 protein, and only two showed over-expression of EGFR protein. The predominant expression of p53 in these young patients suggests that spinal glioblastomas are similar to secondary glioblastoma in the cerebral hemispheres, despite the short duration of symptoms in them and vascular changes that are similar to those noted in primary glioblastoma. These observations support the fact that spinal glioblastomas are heterogeneous tumors underlined by complex molecular pathways. Nevertheless, inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway could play a major role in the genesis of these neoplasms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21643805
"""Immediate post-operative brachytherapy prior to irradiation and temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.""","""To determine whether immediate post-operative brachytherapy can be safely applied to newly diagnosed glioblastomas to retard tumor progression prior to initiation of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and temozolomide. Between 1996 and 2011, eleven patients underwent implantation of GliaSite (n = 9) or MammoSite (n = 2) at the time of surgical resection. Brachytherapy was carried out on post-operative day 2-3, with 45-60 Gy delivered to a 1 cm margin. All patients underwent subsequent standard radiation/temozolomide treatment 4-5 weeks post-irradiation. There were no wound related complications. Toxicity was observed in two patients (2/11 or 18 %), including one post-operative seizure and one case of cerebral edema that resolved after a course of steroid treatment. Immediate post-operative and pre-irradiation/temozolomide magnetic resonance imaging assessment was available for 9 of the 11 patients. Two of these nine patients (22 %) developed new regions of contrast enhancement prior to irradiation/temozolomide. This compares favorably to historical data where 53 % of patient suffer such tumor progression. While there was a trend toward improved 6 month progression free survival in the brachytherapy/temozolomide/radiation treated patients, the overall survival of these patients were comparable to historical controls. This case series demonstrates the safety of immediate post-operative brachytherapy when applied prior to EBRT and temozolomide in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23673513

"""Supramaximal resection: retrospective study on IDH-wildtype Glioblastomas based on the new RANO-Resect classification.""","""Background: The prognostic value of the extent of resection in the management of Glioblastoma is a long-debated topic, recently widened by the 2022 RANO-Resect Classification, which advocates for the resection of the non-enhancing disease surrounding the main core of tumors (supramaximal resection, SUPR) to achieve additional survival benefits. We conducted a retrospective analysis to corroborate the role of SUPR by the RANO-Resect Classification in a single center, homogenous cohort of patients. Methods: Records of patients operated for WHO-2021 Glioblastomas at our institution between 2007 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed; volumetric data of resected lesions were computed and classified by RANO-Resect criteria. Survival and correlation analyses were conducted excluding patients below near-total resection. Results: 117 patients met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 45 near-total resections (NTR), 31 complete resections (CR), and 41 SUPR. Median progression-free and overall survival were 11 and 15 months for NTR, 13 and 17 months or CR, 20 and 24 months for SUPR, respectively (p < 0.001), with inverse correlation observed between survival and FLAIR residual volume (r -0.28). SUPR was not significantly associated with larger preoperative volumes or higher rates of postoperative deficits, although it was less associated with preoperative neurological deficits (OR 3.37, p = 0.003). The impact of SUPR on OS varied between MGMT unmethylated (HR 0.606, p = 0.044) and methylated (HR 0.273, p = 0.002) patient groups. Conclusions: Results of the present study support the validity of supramaximal resection by the new RANO-Resect classification, also highlighting a possible surgical difference between tumors with methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676720
"""Prognostic implications of epilepsy in glioblastomas.""","""Objectives: The role of seizures and antiepileptic treatments associated with glioblastoma is a current topic of discussion. The objective of this study is to characterize and establish implications of epilepsy associated with glioblastoma. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical history, focused on epileptic features of 134 histologically diagnosed glioblastoma over a period of 4 years. Results: The sample group had an average age of 56 years and 66% were male. Complete tumor resection was performed in 66% and 64.2% received further radio-oncologic treatment. The average survival rate was 12.4 months and 11.5% survived to 5 years. Epileptic seizures were the presentation symptom in 27% of cases and 51% suffered seizures during the disease, 26% become drug-resistant. Focal evolving to a bilateral convulsive seizures were the most frequent type. Epileptic seizures at presentation independently predicted longer survival (p<0.001). Furthermore, a history of epilepsy or seizures during disease improved survival. Late onset seizures, recurrences or status epilepticus during the course of the disease indicated tumor progression or the final stages of life. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs did not prevent seizures. Similarly, there was no difference in survival between patients who did not use antiepileptic drugs and those using valproate or levetiracetam. Patients under 60 years, full oncologic treatment and secondary glioblastomas were factors that improved survival (p<0.001). Conclusion: Previous history of epilepsy or the onset of seizures as a presentation symptom in glioblastomas predict longer survival. Half of patients have seizures during the course of the disease. Antiepileptic drugs alone do not increase survival in glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489387
"""Biologic characterization of a secondary glioblastoma with extracranial progression and systemic metastasis.""","""Glioblastomas rarely metastasize outside the CNS. We biologically characterized a case of secondary glioblastoma associated with extracranial progression and distant metastasis. A 42-year-old male patient was subjected to craniotomy for a left temporal tumor (astrocytoma grade II) and subsequently underwent another 3 craniotomies due to tumor recurrences. At the third craniotomy, extracranial progression was noted, and the tumor was classified as a glioblastoma. In order to pinpoint the genes expressed differentially in the intracranial primary tumor and the metastatic tumors, we used cDNA microarray. The patterns of gene expression in these 2 samples were highly similar, suggesting that the mechanism of metastasis was direct infiltration of tumor cells into extracranial blood vessels. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 was overexpressed in both primary and metastatic tumors. Immunohistochemical studies of DNA-dependent protein kinase, which participates in the repair of DNA, was strongly positive in the samples obtained at the first and second operations, but the positive rates were markedly reduced in the specimens obtained at the third and fourth operations. These results suggest that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 and deficiency of DNA-dependent protein kinase proteins promoted tumor progression in the present case.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12626129

"""MicroRNAs in brain tumors : a new diagnostic and therapeutic perspective?""","""MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Although discovered only recently in the early 1990s, this relatively new group of molecules has already been proven to play an essential role in the regulation of many physiological and, most importantly, pathological processes such as cancer. A large number of miRNAs has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, and expression of miRNAs has been demonstrated to correlate with clinic and outcome. In tumors of the brain, however, the investigations on the role of miRNAs are still in its infancy, and most publications refer to the most common primary brain tumor, the glioma (mostly glioblastoma). But despite the fact that there is only limited data available so far, these first results are very promising and implicate that miRNAs might open a new perspective for diagnostics and treatment of this disease. With this review article, we aim to provide a short overview of miRNA biogenesis, function and regulation in general. Thereafter, the clinical relevant data about miRNAs in the two most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults (glioblastomas) and children (medulloblastomas) will be summarized, and their potential impact on diagnostics and treatment will be highlighted.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21739238

Cells were treated with 25 microM cisplatin and 50 microM BCNU, and uPA levels were estimated by fibrin zymography during a 72-h time course. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with cisplatin resulted in significantly decreased levels of uPA in serum-free conditioned medium and cell extracts, compared to BCNU-treated and untreated cell lines. Quantitative levels of uPA enzyme activity assessed by scanning laser densitometry and uPA protein by ELISA using antibody against uPA showed decreased levels of uPA in cisplatin-treated glioma cell lines relative to BCNU and untreated cell lines.

"""The critical role of ERK in death resistance and invasiveness of hypoxia-selected glioblastoma cells.""","""Background: The rapid growth of tumor parenchyma leads to chronic hypoxia that can result in the selection of cancer cells with a more aggressive behavior and death-resistant potential to survive and proliferate. Thus, identifying the key molecules and molecular mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic changes associated with chronic hypoxia has valuable implications for the development of a therapeutic modality. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular basis of the phenotypic changes triggered by chronic repeated hypoxia. Methods: Hypoxia-resistant T98G (HRT98G) cells were selected by repeated exposure to hypoxia and reoxygenation. Cell death rate was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method and protein expression levels were examined by western blot analysis. The invasive phenotype of the tumor cells was determined by the Matrigel invasion assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of proteins in the brain tumor samples. The Student T-test and Pearson Chi-Square test was used for statistical analyses. Results: We demonstrate that chronic repeated hypoxic exposures cause T98G cells to survive low oxygen tension. As compared with parent cells, hypoxia-selected T98G cells not only express higher levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and phosphorylated ERK, but they also have a more invasive potential in Matrigel invasion chambers. Activation or suppression of ERK pathways with a specific activator or inhibitor, respectively, indicates that ERK is a key molecule responsible for death resistance under hypoxic conditions and a more invasive phenotype. Finally, we show that the activation of ERK is more prominent in malignant glioblastomas exposed to hypoxia than in low grade astrocytic glial tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggests that activation of ERK plays a pivotal role in death resistance under chronic hypoxia and phenotypic changes related to the invasive phenotype of HRT98G cells compared to parent cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161638

"""Predictive and prognostic markers in human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most aggressive of all known human tumors. The median survival times remain in the 12- to 15-month range despite aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Through molecular and genetic profiling efforts, underlying mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are becoming better understood. The present standard of care has been shaped by the recently reported phase III study by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Cancer Institute of Canada, which found that the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to radiation therapy significantly improved outcome compared with radiation alone. However, careful examination of these data reveals that not all GBM patients benefited from the addition of TMZ to radiation therapy. A companion correlative study found that GBM patients with tumors with MGMT promoter methylation appeared to derive the greatest benefit from the addition of TMZ to radiation therapy. Although this finding is provocative, it should be kept in mind that this study was performed retrospectively and that prospective validation is required before MGMT methylation can be used for clinical stratification purposes. However, this study does show promise for the tailoring of future treatments according to the molecular and genetic profiles of an individual's tumor rather than using the 'one-glove-fits-all' approach that is currently being followed. As more effective 'smart drugs' are developed, molecular and genetic profiling will assume even greater importance in this regard.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032561
"""Enhancement of radiation sensitivity, delay of proliferative recovery after radiation and abrogation of MAPK (p44/42) signaling by imatinib in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastomas are intrinsically resistant to conventional radiation therapy. The present study investigated the possibility that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, could enhance radiation sensitivity and influence proliferative recovery after irradiation in glioblastoma cells. Radiosensitivity was evaluated by clonogenic survival; apoptotic cell death was evaluated using flow cytometric analysis; proliferative recovery was monitored based on viable cell number subsequent to radiation-induced growth arrest; activation of p44/42 MAPK was based on phosphorylation of the protein. Glioblastoma cells pretreated with imatinib demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to radiation. Imatinib also delayed proliferative recovery in irradiated glioblastoma cells. Imatinib promoted suppression of p44/42 MAPK signaling both when added prior to and post-irradiation. Increased sensitivity to radiation and delayed proliferative recovery in irradiated glioblastoma cells exposed to imatinib may be a consequence of the capacity of imatinib to interfere with p44/42 MAPK kinase signaling. Imatinib may prove to have clinical utility as a neoadjuvant and adjuvant in the treatment of glioblastomas that receive radiation therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16820883
"""Determining optimal treatment strategy for diffuse glioma: the emerging role of IDH mutations.""","""The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes mutate frequently in gliomas, and it has become increasingly apparent that IDH mutation status accounts for much of the prognostic information previously rendered by histological grading.

We examine here how IDH mutation status interacts with treatments known to influence survival (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) in patients with gliomas, and the impact of the IDH mutations on patients' survival after such treatments. IDH mutations is associated with more complete surgical resection of enhancing disease, and with a better response to RT. In addition, there is increasing clinical evidence that, in certain contexts, IDH mutations predict chemotherapeutic sensitivity.

"""NFKBIA deletion in glioblastomas.""","""Background: Amplification and activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene are molecular hallmarks of glioblastomas. We hypothesized that deletion of NFKBIA (encoding nuclear factor of κ-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-α), an inhibitor of the EGFR-signaling pathway, promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastomas that do not have alterations of EGFR. Methods: We analyzed 790 human glioblastomas for deletions, mutations, or expression of NFKBIA and EGFR. We studied the tumor-suppressor activity of NFKBIA in tumor-cell culture. We compared the molecular results with the outcome of glioblastoma in 570 affected persons. Results: NFKBIA is often deleted but not mutated in glioblastomas; most deletions occur in nonclassical subtypes of the disease. Deletion of NFKBIA and amplification of EGFR show a pattern of mutual exclusivity. Restoration of the expression of NFKBIA attenuated the malignant phenotype and increased the vulnerability to chemotherapy of cells cultured from tumors with NFKBIA deletion; it also reduced the viability of cells with EGFR amplification but not of cells with normal gene dosages of both NFKBIA and EGFR. Deletion and low expression of NFKBIA were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients who had tumors with NFKBIA deletion had outcomes that were similar to those in patients with tumors harboring EGFR amplification. These outcomes were poor as compared with the outcomes in patients with tumors that had normal gene dosages of NFKBIA and EGFR. A two-gene model that was based on expression of NFKBIA and O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase was strongly associated with the clinical course of the disease. Conclusions: Deletion of NFKBIA has an effect that is similar to the effect of EGFR amplification in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and is associated with comparatively short survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21175304

Methods: Before treatment, 35 patients (25 men; mean age, 64 ± 14 years) with glioblastoma underwent MRI including first-pass dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion and post-contrast T1WI sequences with gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) and, 48 h later, high-resolution MRA with gadofosveset (0.03 mmol/kg). Volumes of interest for contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL), non-CEL, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter were obtained, and DSC perfusion and DWI parameters were evaluated. Prognostic factors were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Eighteen (51.42 %) glioblastomas were hypervascular on high-resolution MRA. Hypervascular glioblastomas were associated with higher CEL volume and lower Karnofsky score. Median survival rates for patients with hypovascular and hypervascular glioblastomas treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were 15 and 9.75 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Tumor-associated neovascularization was the best predictor of survival at 5.25 months (AUC = 0.794, 81.2 % sensitivity, 77.8 % specificity, 76.5 % positive predictive value, 82.4 % negative predictive value) and yielded the highest hazard ratio (P < 0.001).

"""The transcription factor ATF5: role in neurodevelopment and neural tumors.""","""We review recent findings regarding the properties of ATF5 and the major roles that this transcription factor plays in development of the nervous system and in survival of neural tumors. ATF5 is a widely expressed basic leucine zipper protein that has been subject to limited characterization. It is highly expressed in zones of neuroprogenitor cell proliferation. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that it functions there to promote neuroprogenitor cell expansion and to suppress their differentiation into neurons or glia. ATF5 expression is down-regulated by trophic factors and this is required for their capacity to promote neuroprogenitor cell cycle exit and differentiation into either neurons, oligodendroglia or astrocytes. ATF5 is also highly expressed in a number of tumor types, including neural tumors such as neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas and glioblastomas. Examination of the role of ATF5 in glioblastoma cells indicates that interference with its expression or activity causes them to undergo apoptotic death. In contrast, normal astrocytes and neurons do not appear to require ATF5 for survival, indicating that it may be a selective target for treatment of glioblastomas and other neural neoplasias. Further studies are needed to identify the transcriptional targets of ATF5 and the mechanisms by which its expression is regulated in neuroprogenitors and tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19046351

Following incubation, colonies were counted to determine percent survival. All six cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to Taxol (LD50 1 nM to > 250 nM). However, even at concentrations exceeding those achievable clinically, all cell lines had surviving cells, indicating a saturation threshold for Taxol cytotoxicity. Cell locomotion was evaluated using the radial dish assay to determine the rate of egress of cells from a region of high cell density to the periphery. Increasing Taxol concentration caused increased locomotion in all six cell lines (p < 0.0001). Although Taxol has significant cytocidal impact, it increases in vitro locomotion of glioblastoma cells.

Methods: In total, 155 patients with pathologically diagnosed GBs were retrospectively collected, which included 110 PFH-bearing GBs and 45 PFH-free GBs. The pathological and imaging data were collected. The Visually AcceSAble Rembrandt Images (VASARI) features were carefully evaluated.

Results: The pathological data showed more alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)-loss in PFH-free GBs compared to PFH-bearing ones (p < 0.001). Based on VASARI evaluation, PFH-free GBs had larger intra-tumoral enhancing proportion and smaller necrotic proportion (both, p < 0.001), more common non-enhancing tumor (p < 0.001), mild/minimal enhancement (p = 0.003), expansive T1/FLAIR ratio (p < 0.001) and solid enhancement (p = 0.009), and less pial invasion (p = 0.010). Moreover, multiple ADC- and T1CE-based first-order radiomics features demonstrated differences, especially the lower intensity heterogeneity in PFH-free GBs (for all, adjusted p < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to PFH-bearing GBs, PFH-free ones demonstrated less immature neovascularization and lower intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which would be helpful in clinical treatment stratification. Clinical relevance statement: Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity show less immature neovascularization and lower heterogeneity leading to potential higher treatment benefits due to less drug resistance and treatment failure. Key points: • The study explored the differences between glioblastomas with and without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity. • Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity showed less necrosis and contrast enhancement and lower intensity heterogeneity. • Glioblastomas without peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensity had less immature neovascularization and lower tumor heterogeneity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37495706
"""[Determination of molecular glioblastoma subclasses on the basis of analysis of gene expression].""","""Two glioblastoma groups, which are distinguished from each other by expression level of 416 genes (P < 0.05), were determined using a mathematical model of linear Boolean programming on the basis of gene expression data, obtained by microarray analysis of the glioblastomas and available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base. The expression level of 15 genes was more than two-fold higher in the first group of glioblastoma (80 samples) in comparison with the second group (144 samples) and 401 genes and--more than two-fold lower as compared to the second group. 10 of 15 genes, which expression level prevailed in the first group, encode the proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation. A significant percentage of 401 genes are the genes that encode proteins involved in the functioning of neural cells and participating in the processes such as synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, the formation of myelin sheath, axon formation. Kohonen map, built on the basis of the data of 15 genes with prevailed expression in the first group and 60 (of4 01) genes, whose expression level elevated in the second group, confirmed the existence of two glioblastoma groups with specific gene expression profiles. Distribution of the glioblastomas into two groups may reflect two pathways of astrocytic glioma development, one of which leads to the formation of tumors with higher levels of gene expression, which protein products are involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. On the other hand, the existence of two molecular variants may reflect different states of glioblastoma progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25536822
"""Molecular genetic analysis of deep-seated glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma can be divided into genetic subsets. The most prominent criterion for dividing glioblastomas into subsets is the dichotomy between TP53 mutation and EGFR amplification, two genetic alterations that almost never coincide in the same tumor. Approximately one third of glioblastomas have TP53 mutations, one third have EGFR amplification, and one third have neither. When viewed in terms of tumor progression, secondary glioblastomas have a much higher incidence of TP53 mutations than do primary glioblastomas. When viewed in terms of the age of tumor onset, glioblastomas in young adults are likely to have TP53 mutations. However, no correlations have yet been found between the tumor locations and the genetic subsets. In this study, we evaluated the associations between the glioblastoma sites and the genetic subsets defined by the presence of the TP53 mutation or EGFR amplification in nine deep-seated glioblastomas of the thalamus and basal ganglia. All nine tumors were clinically defined as primary glioblastomas. Our investigation revealed that all tumors had TP53 mutations and none had EGFR amplifications. These findings suggest that glioblastomas deep-seated in the thalamus and basal ganglia can be grouped into a subset of glioblastomas with TP53 mutations, akin to the subsets of secondary and younger adult glioblastomas. The locations where the glioblastomas originate may be associated with the genetic features.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15325097

The glioblastoma itself represents the most unfavorable tumor. In Switzerland, about 450 humans contract a glioblastoma each year. The median survival time is under 12 months, thus the prognosis is dismal despite a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical resection presents the major constituent in the management of patients with a glioblastoma. Postoperative radio- and chemotherapy have beneficial effects on the survival time and quality of life. Surgical removal of glioblastomas is challenging due to their infiltrative growth pattern. Therefore, the target extent of resection can only be achieved partially. For some time now, a new in Germany developed method is used in the Neurosurgical Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen: The 5-ALA-guided microsurgical resection method allows a targeted and secure surgical resection of the tumor. A preoperative administered substance colors the tumor and makes it better visible for the neurosurgeon. Consequently, the healthy brain tissue can be better distinguished from the tumor. This permits not only a larger complete surgical resection of the tumor but also minimizes the resection of healthy tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19513974

We studied 72 patients who underwent surgical removal of supratentorial glioblastomas and had CT and/or MRI with contrast medium before surgery; 38, all undergoing the same treatment (surgery plus radiotherapy), were followed clinically. Necrosis within the tumour varied greatly, ranging from none (only 1 case) to involvement of 76% of the tumour. Survival data in the subgroup suggested that only patients with a small area of necrosis (less than 35% of the tumour) had a significantly longer survival time.

VEGF takes part in numerous changes including the endothelial cell proliferation, the vasculature of solid tumor: its survival invasion, and migration, chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, vasodilation and vascular permeability. VEGF inhibition can be a smart therapeutic strategy because it is extremely specific and less toxic than cytotoxic therapy. To establish better inhibition of VEGF than the current inhibitors, present study approach is by molecular docking, virtual screening to illustrate the inhibitor with superior affinity against VEGF to have a cautious pharma profile. To retrieve the best established and high-affinity high affinity molecule, Molegro Virtual Docker software was executed. The high-affinity scoring compounds were subjected to further similarity search to retrieve the drugs with similar properties from pubchem database. The completion of virtual screening reveals that PubChem compound SCHEMBL1250485 (PubChem CID: 66965667) has the highest affinity. The study of the drug-likeness was verified using OSIRIS Property Explorer software which supported the virtual screened result. Further ADMET study and drug comparative study strongly prove the superiority of the new established inhibitor with lesser rerank score and toxicity. Overall, the new inhibitor has higher potential to stop the expression of VEGF in glioblastoma and positively can be further analysed through In vitro studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554364

There are no known molecules that are directly linked to the MIB-1 LI in astrocytomas. We evaluated the clinical value of the MIB-1 LI in our human glioblastoma cases and determined the molecules that possibly influenced the MIB-1 LI. An immunohistochemical study of the MIB-1 protein was performed and MIB-1 LIs of 38 glioblastomas were determined. In the same cases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P(1)), which are known regulators of glioma cell proliferation, were detected and quantified by quantitative real-time-PCR or western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 38 patients with glioblastomas showed that a high MIB-1 LI correlated with poor survival (P < 0.05). Among the molecules tested, only the low expression of S1P(1) was significantly correlated with the high MIB-1 LI in glioblastomas (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the S1P(1) expression level was a significant prognostic factor. Our results indicate that the MIB-1 LI is an important prognostic factor in human glioblastomas. Furthermore, downregulation of S1P(1) expression increases proliferative activity, and thus enhances the malignancy of glioblastomas, resulting in a poor survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19937366

PubMed and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles pertaining to cases of glioblastomas / gliosarcomas with primary spinal origin, using predefined search terms. Furthermore we performed hand searches tracking the references from the selected papers. Eighty-two articles published between 1938 and March 2015 were eligible. They reported on 157 patients. Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The proportion of patients who received adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy clearly increased from the time before 1980 until present. Median overall survival from diagnosis was 8.0 ± 0.9 months. On univariate analysis age influenced overall survival, whereas tumor location, gender and the extent of initial resection did not. Outcomes did not differ between children (< 18 years) and adults. However, the patients who were treated after 1980 achieved longer survival times than the patients treated before. On multivariable analysis only age (< 60 years) and the time period of treatment (≥ 1980) were confirmed as positive independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, primary spinal GB / GS mainly affect younger patients and are associated with a dismal prognosis. However, most likely due to the increasing use of adjuvant treatment, modest therapeutic progress has been achieved over recent decades.

Despite of very aggressive treatment options based on surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of affected patients has remained poor and showed only slight improvements during the last 30 years. Research on glioblastoma border zone was hindered by the tumor's intense invasion into the brain parenchyma and the lack of suitable tumor cell markers. Nevertheless, the compact tumor mass and tumor invasion zone are composed of distinct cell types that need to be distinguished from each other to be addressed selectively. As the isoform 140 of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-140) was recently demonstrated to be lost in human gliomas with rising WHO grade, human multiform glioblastomas were characterized as a NCAM-140 negative entity displaying three main distinct invasion patterns. Evaluation of putative therapy targets within the tumor tissue and tumor invasion zone has been made possible through NCAM-140 negativity. In the present study, brain tissue controls and human glioblastoma samples with compact tumor mass and invasion areas were analyzed for their vascularization at the tumor border and the expression of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR-1) within tumor tissue and vascular vessel walls. Use of NCAM-140 enabled the identification of the tumor invasion zone and its experimental investigation. Tissue vascularization was found to be significantly increased in the compact tumor mass of glioblastomas compared to their invasion zone and tumor-free controls with a significantly high and specific overexpression of PAR-1 within tumor cells and within tumor blood vessels depending upon the tumor area. This suggests thereby a functional role of the thrombin receptor PAR-1 in glioma cell malignancy and glioblastoma neoangiogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24620969

We describe four cases of PXA evaluated during intraoperative procedures. Findings were compared with those of 22 glioblastomas. PXA smears were moderately cellular and showed a variable population of pleomorphic cells and fibrillary fragments with vessels. Tumoral cells were of intermediate size with a less frequent population of large, atypical cells. Some showed bi/trinucleation with bizarre nuclei. In two cases, tumoral cells with microvacuolization resembling xanthic astrocytes were present. No necrosis, mitotic activity, phagocytic macrophages or apoptotic fragments were seen. Smears from glioblastoma were more cellular than those of PXA with numerous neoplastic cells, branching vessels and myxoid substance. Cellular atypia was evident and mitoses were seen in all cases. Most cases showed an abundant population of accompanying macrophages and cellular debris. Differences between PXA and glioblastoma were related to cell turnover rather than cytomorphologic features. Glioblastoma shows features of high cellular replication showing a dirty background with necrosis and phagocytic macrophages as well as mitotic figures and apoptosis.

We aimed to develop and validate vascular habitats based on perfusion and vessel size to predict time to progression (TTP) in patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab. Methods: Sixty-nine patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab who underwent pretreatment MRI with dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging and vessel architectural imaging were enrolled. Vascular habitats were constructed using vessel size index (VSI) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). Associations with vascular habitats and TTP were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. In a prospectively enrolled validation cohort consisting of 15 patients ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier; NCT04143425), stratification of TTP was demonstrated by the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test) using vascular habitats. Results: Three vascular habitats consisting of high, intermediate, and low angiogenic habitats were identified with rCBV and VSI. Both high angiogenic and intermediate angiogenic habitats were significantly associated with a shorter TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.78 and 1.82, respectively; largest p = .003) and so was rCBV (HR, 2.15; p = .02).

Methods: T1-post gadolinium images for 188 patients and 138 patients were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive's (TCIA) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma collection, and from the University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC), respectively. Anomaly detection methods were tested on glioblastoma image features for the precision of mIDH detection and compared to standard classification methods. Results: Using anomaly detection training methods, we were able to detect IDH mutations from features in noncontrast-enhancing regions in glioblastoma with an average precision of 75.0%, 69.9%, and 69.8% using three different models. Anomaly detection methods consistently outperformed traditional two-class classification methods from 2 unique learning models (67.9%, 67.6%). The disparity in performances could not be overcome through newer, popular models such as neural networks (67.4%).

This suggests that the efficacy of XRT can be optimized before treatment in order to yield longer survival times. However, while current efforts focus on optimal scheduling of radiotherapy treatment, they do not include a similarly sophisticated spatial optimization. In an effort to improve XRT, we present a method for the spatial optimization of radiation profiles. We expand upon previous results in the general problem and examine the more physically reasonable cases of 1-step and 2-step radiation profiles during the first and second XRT fractions.

These findings were then compared with the computerized tomography (CT) scans in 11 cases in order to determine the extent to which the peripheral portion of the neoplasm can be estimated by the presence of a low-density area without contrast enhancement. The results of the histological study confirmed the marked heterogeneity of GBM's and disclosed a great variability in the geometry, extent, and character of the peripheral 'infiltrating' margin. In spite of the widely held concept that glioblastomas are localized within 2 cm of the contrast-enhanced rim, there were three cases in this two-dimensional study in which this distance was exceeded, and it seems likely that three-dimensional reconstructions would have detected additional cases in which neoplastic cells extended beyond this arbitrary limit. Only three of the 15 GBM's were restricted to the distribution of one internal carotid or one vertebral artery. To the extent that the neoplasms in the present series are representative, this suggests that glioblastomas will be difficult to treat successfully by intra-arterial therapy using existing therapeutic agents. Correlations of histological sections with the CT scans revealed that the vast majority of the neoplastic tissue was contained within the contrast-enhancing and 'peritumoral' areas of low density, but that in five cases fingers of neoplasm extended for short distances beyond the outer margin of the latter region. This indicates that the distribution of cells of a GBM cannot be inferred from CT images since the 'peritumoral' area of low density can over- or underestimate the extent of the lesion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2833587

"""Altered cellular distribution and subcellular sorting of gamma-tubulin in diffuse astrocytic gliomas and human glioblastoma cell lines.""","""Centrosome amplification is a pivotal mechanism underlying tumorigenesis but its role in gliomas is underinvestigated. The present study specifically examines the expression and distribution of the centrosome-associated cytoskeletal protein gamma-tubulin in 56 primary diffuse astrocytic gliomas (grades II-IV) and in 4 human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG, U118MG, U138MG, and T98G). Monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies recognizing epitopes in C-terminal or N-terminal domains of the gamma-tubulin molecule were used in immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting studies. In tumors in adults (n = 46), varying degrees of localization were detected in all tumor grades, but immunoreactivity was significantly increased in high-grade anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme as compared to low-grade diffuse astrocytomas (p = 0.0001). A similar trend was noted in diffuse gliomas in children but the sample of cases was too small as to be statistically meaningful. Two overlapping patterns of ectopic cellular localization were identified in both primary tumors and glioblastoma cell lines: A punctate pattern, in which gamma-tubulin was partially co-distributed with pericentrin in the pericentriolar region, and a diffuse pattern, independent of pericentrin staining, denoting a soluble pool of gamma-tubulin. Cellular gamma-tubulin was detected in both soluble and insoluble (nocodazole-resistant) fractions of glioblastoma cells. Divergent localizations of gamma-tubulin and pericentrin suggest a differential distribution of these 2 centrosome-associated proteins in glioblastoma cell lines. Our results indicate that overexpression and ectopic cellular distribution of gamma-tubulin in astrocytic gliomas may be significant in the context of centrosome protein amplification and may be linked to tumor progression and anaplastic potential.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16772870

Tumor tissue and survival were studied in a series of 38 patients with glioblastoma, previously treated by surgical resection and radiotherapy. For each tumor, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies were performed in order to study MIB-1 LI, and VESS, expressed as the CD-34 immunostained endothelial surface per 1000 tumor cells. The survival for the entire patient population of the series was 48.1+/-14.1 weeks, and the mean VESS for the tumors of the series ranged from 16.7 to 107 microm2 per 1000 tumor cells (mean: 38.7+/-18.2). Factors such as age or MIB-1 LI were not significatively associated with survival, but the median survival for the 18 patients with a VESS less than 35 was 50.7+/-3.7 weeks, versus 45.9+/-2.8 weeks for the 20 patients showing a VESS higher than 36 (p < 0.05).

To correlate gene expression signatures of glioblastoma cell lines or tumors with response to chemotherapy (DeLay et al., Clin Cancer Res 18(10):2930-2942, 2012). ii. To correlate gene expression patterns with biological features like proliferation or invasiveness of the glioblastoma cells (Jiang et al., PLoS One 8(6):e66008, 2013). iii.

By using the integrability conditions for the Abel equation several classes of exact travelling wave solutions of the general reaction-diffusion equation that describes glioblastoma growth are obtained, corresponding to different forms of the product of the diffusion and reaction functions. The solutions are obtained by using the Chiellini lemma and the Lemke transformation, respectively, and the corresponding equations represent generalizations of the classical Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.

"""Genomic expression patterns distinguish long-term from short-term glioblastoma survivors: a preliminary feasibility study.""","""We used microarray analysis to investigate associations between genotypic expression profiles and survival phenotypes in patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM). Tumor samples from 7 long-term glioblastoma survivors (>24 months) and 13 short-term survivors (<9 months) were analyzed to detect differential patterns of gene expression between these groups and to identify genotypic subclasses of glioblastomas that correlate with survival phenotypes. Five unsupervised and three supervised clustering algorithms consistently and accurately grouped the tumors into genotypic subgroups corresponding to the two clinical survival phenotypes. Three unique prospective mathematical classification algorithms were subsequently trained to use expression data to stratify unknown glioblastomas between survival groups and performed this task with 100% accuracy in validation studies. A set of 1478 genes with significant differential expression (p<0.01) between long-term and short-term survivors was identified, and additional mathematical filtering was used to isolate a 43-gene 'fingerprint' that distinguished survival phenotypes. Differential regulation of a subset of these genes was confirmed using RT-PCR. Gene ontology analysis of the fingerprint demonstrated pathophysiologic functions for the gene products that are consistent with current models of tumor biology, suggesting that differential expression of these genes may contribute etiologically to the observed differences in survival. These results demonstrate that unique expression profiles characterize genotypic subsets of primary GBMs associated with differential survival phenotypes, and these profiles can be used in a prospective fashion to assign unknown tumors to survival groups. Future efforts will focus on building more robust classifiers and identifying additional subclasses of gliomas with phenotypic significance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18343632

Methods: Forty-eight patients diagnosed with brain tumors were enrolled. All patients underwent conventional MRI, APTw, and ASL scans on a 3.0 T MRI system. The mean APTw value and mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) value were measured. The differences in various parameters between GBMs and SBMs were assessed using the independent-samples t-test. The quantitative performance of these MRI parameters in distinguishing between GBMs and SBMs was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: GBMs exhibited significantly higher APTw and CBF values in peritumoral regions compared with SBMs (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between SBMs and GBMs in tumor cores. APTw MRI had a higher diagnostic efficiency in differentiating SBMs from GBMs (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.864; 75.0% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity). Combined use of APTw and CBF value increased the AUC to 0.927.

"""Dephosphorylation of beta-arrestin 1 in glioblastomas.""","""Beta-Arrestins act as signal terminators for G protein-coupled receptors; they have also been implicated as scaffolding proteins for Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways and transactivators of receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting their possible role in development and oncogenic signaling. Dephosphorylation of serine 412 is necessary for Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase transactivation. We hypothesized that altered beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation and activation status could play a role in gliomagenesis. Using monoclonal anti-phospho-(serine 412)- and total beta-arrestin 1 antibodies, we performed immunohistochemistry on 126 human glioma samples and 7 nonneoplastic controls and Western blot analysis on 5 glioblastomas and 5 nonneoplastic controls. We found high constitutive beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly in neurons and neuropil. Most Grade II and III gliomas retained high beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation. By contrast, most of the glioblastoma samples (58/81) showed nearly complete beta-arrestin 1 dephosphorylation by immunohistochemistry and decreased relative phosphorylation by Western blot. Expression of constitutively activated epidermal growth factor receptor vIII in U251 cells caused decreased beta-arrestin 1 phosphorylation without altering total beta-arrestin 1 levels. These results suggest that beta-arrestin 1 dephosphorylation/inactivation is associated with aspects of the malignant behavior of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19404096

Tumor tissue and neuroimaging data were studied in a series of 38 patients with glioblastoma. For each tumor, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies were performed in order to obtain a score of VPF expression, and a VES score, expressed as the CD-34 immunostained endothelial surface per each 1000 tumor cells. These parameters were related to the degree of PE. The results show that in glioblastomas there exist a clear correlation between the tumor-cell expression of VPF and VES, but we failed to obtain a significant correlation between degree of PE and degree of VES, or between degree of VPF expression and degree of PE.

"""Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in glioblastoma: an analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype by CISH method.""","""We examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression and EGFR gene amplification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in 109 glioblastomas, including 98 primary glioblastomas and 11 secondary glioblastomas. EGFR overexpression and EGFR gene amplification were found in 33% and 24% of glioblastoma, respectively, and all of those cases were primary glioblastoma. Large ischemic necrosis was significantly more frequent in primary glioblastomas than in secondary glioblastomas (54% vs. 18%), but pseudopalisading necrosis was not (65% vs. 54%). EGFR gene amplification was detected significantly more frequently in cases with both types of necrosis. Although glioblastomas with EGFR gene amplification invariably exhibited EGFR overexpression at the level of the whole tumor, tumor cells with EGFR gene amplification did not always show EGFR overexpression at the level of individual tumor cells. Cases of 'strong' EGFR overexpression on IHC could be regarded as having EGFR gene amplification, and cases without EGFR overexpression could not. Cases of 'weak' EGFR overexpression should be tested with CISH to confirm the presence of EGFR gene amplification. We found that 54% of glioblastomas with EGFR gene amplification were composed of areas with and without EGFR gene amplification; however, there were no obvious differences in morphology between tumor cells with and without EGFR gene amplification. Although small cell architecture might be associated with EGFR gene amplification at the level of the whole tumor, it did not always suggest amplification of the EGFR gene at the level of individual tumor cells. In one case, it seemed to suggest that a clone with EGFR gene amplification may arise in pre-existing tumor tissue and extend into the surrounding area. In cases of overall EGFR amplification, CISH would be a useful tool to decide the tumor border in areas infiltrated by tumor cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18021194
"""IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.""","""Purpose: Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a new diagnostic approach allowing the visualization of tumor stroma. Here, we applied FAP-specific PET imaging to gliomas. We analyzed the target affinity and specificity of two FAP ligands (FAPI-02 and FAPI-04) in vitro, and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in mice in vivo. Clinically, we used 68Ga-labeled FAPI-02/04 for PET imaging in 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas, 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). Methods: For binding studies with 177Lu-radiolabeled FAPI-02/04, we used the glioblastoma cell line U87MG, FAP-transfected fibrosarcoma cells, and CD26-transfected human embryonic kidney cells. For pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies, U87MG-xenografted mice were injected with 68Ga-labeled compounds followed by small-animal PET imaging and 177Lu-labeled FAPI-02/04, respectively. Clinical PET/CT scans were performed 30 min post intravenous administration of 68Ga-FAPI-02/04. PET and MRI scans were co-registrated. Immunohistochemistry was done on 14 gliomas using a FAP-specific antibody. Results: FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 showed high binding specificity to FAP. FAPI-04 demonstrated higher tumor accumulation and delayed elimination compared with FAPI-02 in preclinical studies. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV, but not grade II, IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake. In glioblastomas, we observed spots with increased uptake in projection on contrast-enhancing areas. Immunohistochemistry showed FAP-positive cells with mainly elongated cell bodies and perivascular FAP-positive cells in glioblastomas and an anaplastic IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Conclusions: Using FAP-specific PET imaging, increased tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytomas, but not in diffuse astrocytomas, may allow non-invasive distinction between low-grade IDH-mutant and high-grade gliomas. Therefore, FAP-specific imaging in gliomas may be useful for follow-up studies although further clinical evaluation is required.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31388723
"""[Clinicopathological diagnosis of gliomas by genotype analysis].""","""Currently, the use of microscopical examinations alone is insufficient for the histological classification and grading of gliomas. In recognition of the emerging role of molecular diagnostic approaches to glioma classification, the role of genetic profiles has been emphasized on, as in the distinct subtypes of glioma. Glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) may develop de novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from lower-grade astrocytomas (secondary glioblastomas) both glioblastomas show similar histological features. However, these subtypes of glioblastoma involve distinct disease entities that evolve through different genetic pathways and are likely to differ in prognosis and response to therapy. Oligodendroglioma is recognized as a particular subtype of gliomas that shows remarkable response to chemotherapy [procarbazine+CCNU+vincristine (PCV)], making their correct diagnosis important. However, the histological differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from diffuse astrocytoma could be highly subjective in cases without typical morphological features. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q is correlated with sensitivity to PCV chemotherapy with increased survival in anaplastic oligodendroglioma cases (WHO grade III). Similarly, combined LOH on 1p and 19q has been identified as a predictor of favorable overall survival in oligodendrogliomas. Additionally, the status of the O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase gene (O6-MGMT) is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously found methylation or expression mosaicism of O6-MGMT in gliomas, resulting in problems on tumor sampling and response to TMZ. An assessment of the O6-MGMT methylation mosaicism in heterogeneous glioma may provide a more accurate assessment for the response to TMZ.

"""Phenotype vs genotype in the evolution of astrocytic brain tumors.""","""Astrocytic brain tumors are the most frequent human gliomas and they include a wide range of neoplasms with distinct clinical, histopathologic, and genetic features. Diffuse astrocytomas are predominantly located in the cerebral hemispheres of adults and have an inherent tendency to progress to anaplastic astrocytoma and (secondary) glioblastoma. The majority of glioblastomas develop de novo (primary glioblastomas), without an identifiable less-malignant precursor lesion. These subtypes of glioblastoma evolve through different genetic pathways, affect patients at different ages, and are likely to differ in their responses to therapy. Primary glioblastomas occur in older patients and typically show epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, PTEN mutations, p16 deletions, and, less frequently, MDM2 amplification. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and often contain TP53 mutations as their earliest detectable alteration. Morphologic variants of glioblastoma were shown to have intermediate clinical and genetic profiles. The giant cell glioblastoma clinically and genetically occupies a hybrid position between primary (de novo) and secondary glioblastomas. Gliosarcomas show identical gene mutations in the gliomatous and sarcomatous tumor components, which strongly supports the concept that there is a monoclonal origin for gliosarcomas and an evolution of the sarcomatous component due to aberrant mesenchymal differentiation in a highly malignant astrocytic neoplasm.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10669004

These data were correlated with patient survival using multivariable Cox analysis and, for a subset of 167 tumors, with signs of tumor invasiveness on the MRI. The effects of STAT5b knockdown by siRNA were assessed on the growth, therapeutic resistance, invasion and migration of GBM cell lines U87, U87‑EGFRVIII and LN18 and primary cultures GM2 and GM3. The activation, but not the copy number or the mRNA expression of nuclear transcription factor STAT5b expression correlated inversely with patient survival independently of IDH1R132H status, age, Karnofsky Performance Score, treatment and tumor volume. STAT5b inhibition neither altered the cell proliferation nor reduced the clonogenic proliferative potency of GBM cells, and did not sensitize them to the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation and temozolomide in vitro. STAT5b inhibition significantly increased GBM cell migration, but decreased the invasion of some GBM cells in vitro. There was no correlation between the activation of STAT5b in clinical tumors and the extent of invasion on MRI OF patients. In conclusion, STAT5b is frequently activated in GBM and correlates inversely with patient survival.

"""Functional diversity of PFKFB3 splice variants in glioblastomas.""","""Tumor cells tend to metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. One of the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis is 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, which is allosterically activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate which in turn is produced by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2 or PFKFB). Mounting evidence suggests that cancerous tissues overexpress the PFKFB isoenzyme, PFKFB3, being causing enhanced proliferation of cancer cells. Initially, six PFKFB3 splice variants with different C-termini have been documented in humans. More recently, additional splice variants with varying N-termini were discovered the functions of which are to be uncovered. Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest forms of brain tumors. Up to now, the role of PFKFB3 splice variants in the progression and prognosis of glioblastomas is only partially understood. In this study, we first re-categorized the PFKFB3 splice variant repertoire to simplify the denomination. We investigated the impact of increased and decreased levels of PFKFB3-4 (former UBI2K4) and PFKFB3-5 (former variant 5) on the viability and proliferation rate of glioblastoma U87 and HEK-293 cells. The simultaneous knock-down of PFKFB3-4 and PFKFB3-5 led to a decrease in viability and proliferation of U87 and HEK-293 cells as well as a reduction in HEK-293 cell colony formation. Overexpression of PFKFB3-4 but not PFKFB3-5 resulted in increased cell viability and proliferation. This finding contrasts with the common notion that overexpression of PFKFB3 enhances tumor growth, but instead suggests splice variant-specific effects of PFKFB3, apparently with opposing effects on cell behaviour. Strikingly, in line with this result, we found that in human IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, the PFKFB3-4 to PFKFB3-5 ratio was significantly shifted towards PFKFB3-4 when compared to control brain samples. Our findings indicate that the expression level of distinct PFKFB3 splice variants impinges on tumorigenic properties of glioblastomas and that splice pattern may be of important diagnostic value for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34234350

These cells, termed cancer stem-like cells, have been designed as prominent targets for new and more efficient cancer therapies. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of membrane receptors, play a prominent role in cell signaling, cell communication and crosstalk with the microenvironment.

Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that FGFR1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in glioblastomas than in normal brain adjacent to the tumor or in untransformed human brain. These results were consistent with immunocytochemical localization of FGFR1 protein in glioblastomas: glioblastoma cells exhibited intense FGFR1 immunoreactivity in frozen sections of tumor and low to undetectable FGFR1 immunoreactivity in adjacent normal brain or in normal white matter obtained from patients without neoplastic disease. Endothelial cells of capillaries and larger vessels within the tumor were devoid of FGFR1 immunoreactivity. All glioblastomas evaluated in the present study expressed FGFR1 mRNA and FGFR1 immunoreactivity. Examination of the FGFR1 gene by Southern blot analysis indicated that overexpression of FGFR1 mRNA in glioblastomas did not result from gene amplification. These results indicate that glioblastoma cells, in contrast to endothelial cells within the tumor, display increased levels of FGFR1.

"""ell clusters isolation in glioblastomas and their functional and molecular characterization using new morphometric approaches.""","""Background: Digital pathology has come a long way in terms of creating tools to improve existing diagnostic approaches. However, several pathology fields, such as neuropathology, are still characterized by low coverage from machine learning tools and neural network analysis, which may be due to the complexity of the internal cellular and molecular structure of the corresponding neoplasms, including glioblastomas. Method: In the framework of this study, using advanced proprietary tools for obtaining images of histological slides and their deep morphometric analysis, we studied samples of 198 patients with glioblastoma with the selection of morphometric cell clusters. Also, cells of each cluster were isolated, and their proliferative, migratory, invasive activity, survival ability, aerobic glycolysis activity, and chemo- and radioresistance were studied. Results: Four morphometric clusters were identified, including small-cell cluster, paracirculonuclear cluster, hypochromic cluster, and macronuclear cluster, which significantly differed in morphometric parameters and functional parameters. Hypochromic cluster cells demonstrated the highest proliferation activity; macronuclear cluster was the most active glucose consumer; paracirculonuclear cluster had the most prominent migratory and invasive activity and hypoxia resistance; small-cell cluster demonstrated predominantly average values of all parameters. Moreover, additional analysis revealed the presence of a separate subcluster of stem cell elements that correspond in their molecular properties to glioma stem cells and are present in all four clusters. It also turned out that several key molecular parameters of glioblastoma, such as mutational modifications in the EGFR, PDGFRA, and NF1 genes, along with the molecular GBM subtype, are significantly correlated with the identified cell clusters. Conclusions: Thus, the results represent an up-and-coming innovation in the practical field of digital pathology and fundamental questions of glioma carcinogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37582322
"""Growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are primary malignant brain tumors with a dismal prognosis. Knowledge of growth rates and underlying growth dynamics is useful for understanding basic tumor biology, developing realistic tumor models, and planning treatment logistics. Methods: By using repeated pretreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from 106 patients (aged 26-83 years), we studied the growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo. Growth rates were calculated as specific growth rates and equivalent volume doubling times. The fit of different possible growth models was assessed using maximum likelihood estimations. Results: There were large variations in growth rates between patients. The median specific growth rate of the tumors was 1.4% per day, and the equivalent volume doubling time was 49.6 days. Exploring 3 different tumor growth models showed similar statistical fit for a Gompertzian growth model and a linear radial growth model and worse fit for an exponential growth model. However, large tumors had significantly lower growth rates than smaller tumors, supporting the assumption that glioblastomas reach a plateau phase and thus exhibit Gompertzian growth. Conclusion: Based on the fast growth rate of glioblastoma shown in this study, it is evident that poor treatment logistics will influence tumor size before surgery and can cause significant regrowth before adjuvant treatment. Since there is a known association between tumor volume, extent of surgical resection, and response to adjuvant therapy, it is likely that waiting times play a role in patient outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25758748

With digital pathology and improved immunohistochemical multiplexing becoming a part of daily diagnostics, we investigated the prognostic value of the Ki-67 labelling index (LI) in glioblastomas more precisely than previously by excluding proliferation in non-tumor cells from the analysis. We investigated the Ki-67 LI in a well-annotated population-based glioblastoma patient cohort (178 IDH-wildtype, 3 IDH-mutated). Ki-67 was identified in full tumor sections with automated digital image analysis and the contribution from non-tumor cells was excluded using quantitative double-immunohistochemistry. For comparison of the Ki-67 LI between WHO grades (II-IV), 9 IDH-mutated diffuse astrocytomas and 9 IDH-mutated anaplastic astrocytomas were stained. Median Ki-67 LI increased with increasing WHO grade (median 2.7%, 6.4% and 27.5%). There was no difference in median Ki-67 LI between IDH-mutated and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas (p = 0.9) and Ki-67 LI was not associated with survival in glioblastomas in neither univariate (p = 0.9) nor multivariate analysis including MGMT promoter methylation status and excluding IDH-mutated glioblastomas (p = 0.2).

The 7-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a history of headache for one month. On admission, increased intracranial pressure and left cerebellar signs were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a ring-enhanced mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere and a low intensity lesion in the pons. The tumor had compressed the fourth ventricle and caused obstructive hydrocephalus. Gross total resection of the left cerebellar tumor was performed. Histological examination revealed nuclear atypia, mitoses, and necrosis, which satisfied the World Health Organizations histological criteria for grade IV astrocytoma.

The focus was on understanding whether the interval between surgery and CCRT impacts survival outcomes. Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database ( https://opendata.hira.or.kr/ ) were collected to retrospectively review 3,586 patients diagnosed with GBM in South Korea between 2008 and 2021. Patients were divided into early CCRT (≤ 21 days between surgery and CCRT) and late CCRT (> 21 days between surgery and CCRT) groups and further categorised based on the type of surgery (biopsy alone or surgical resection). The study estimated overall survival (OS) and conducted univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 19.98 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 19.12-20.86 months). In univariable analysis, the late CCRT group demonstrated a longer median OS compared to the early CCRT group (20.47 vs. 17.94 months, P = 0.0002, log-rank test). However, this difference was not significant in multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.782-1.091, P = 0.6663). Subgroup analysis revealed that late CCRT was associated with prolonged OS in patients who underwent surgical resection (adjusted HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.752-0.955, P = 0.0065), whereas in the biopsy-alone group, late CCRT was associated with shorter OS (adjusted HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.378-2.346, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients who initiated CCRT more than 21 days post-resection demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) compared to those who began CCRT earlier. In contrast, among patients who underwent biopsy alone, initiating CCRT within 21 days was associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest that the optimal timing for CCRT initiation in GBM may depend on the extent of residual tumour.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39587516

Methodology: The inclusion criteria included case reports or series of primary spinal cord GBMs, while excluding inconclusive histopathological cases and articles not in English or Portuguese. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PubMed and Mendeley search engines. Results: The data from 237 patients (mean age: 28.6 years; male-to-female ratio 1.35:1) were analyzed. On radiological imaging, GBMs exhibited patterns similar to those of cranial GBMs. Most tumors were located in the cervical and thoracic regions, with motor deficits as the primary presenting symptom. Almost all patients underwent surgical treatment (88,6%), often followed by adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy (56.5 %) and radiotherapy (68 %). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.5 months, while overall survival (OS) was 15.3 months, with no significant sex or age differences observed.

"""Prognostic significance of neuronal marker expression in glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: Glioblastomas are the most malignant tumors of central nervous system neoplasms and are well known for their biological heterogeneity. Contrary to the putative hypothesis of purely glial differentiation in glioblastomas, they often demonstrate immunopositivity for neuronal markers. However, the significance of their neuronal marker expression is still controversial. To evaluate the prognostic implication of neuronal expression in glioblastoma, this study investigated the expression of neuronal markers in a large series of glioblastoma patients in terms of patient survival rate. Methods: Expression of synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, and NeuN was explored using immunohistochemistry in 88 cases of glioblastoma. Clinicopathological variables as well as patients' survival data were compared according to the immunopositivity of cases. Results: Sixty-one of the 88 tumors (69.3 %) were positive for at least one neuronal marker. Synaptophysin positivity was observed in 43 cases (48.9 %). Neurofilament protein and NeuN were positive in 38 (43.2 %) and 42 cases (47.7 %), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival and progression-free survival in association with neuronal marker expression. However, gross total removal or combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival (P=0.041 and 0.044). Cox's proportional hazard model revealed that NeuN expression was the independent prognostic factors in progression-free survival (P=0.012). Conclusions: Although the correlation of neuronal marker expression and clinical outcome in glioblastoma is of considerable interest, the presented data support the limited prognostic value of neuronal marker expression in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22922887
"""1p/19q testing has no significance in the workup of glioblastomas.""","""Aims: To determine whether testing for isolated 1p or 19q losses, or as a codeletion, has any significance in the workup of glioblastomas (GBMs). Methods: Upfront 1p/19q testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was done in 491 gliomas that were histologically diagnosed as GBMs. Outcomes were determined and measured against 1p/19q results. Results: Twenty-eight showed apparent 1p/19q codeletion by either FISH and/or PCR-based LOH, but only 1/26 showed codeletion by both tests. Over 90% of tumours with apparent codeletion by either FISH or LOH also had 10q LOH and/or EGFR amplification, features inversely related to true whole-arm 1p/19q codeletion. Furthermore, only 1/28 tumours demonstrated an R132H IDH1 mutation. Neither 1p/19q codeletion by FISH nor LOH had an impact on GBM survival. Isolated losses of 1p or 19q also had no impact on survival. Conclusions: These data suggest that (i) 1p/19q testing is not useful on gliomas that are histologically GBMs; (ii) codeletion testing should be reserved only for cases with compatible morphology; and (iii) EGFR, 10q, and IDH1 testing can help act as safeguards against a false-positive 1p/19q result.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23363074

We analyzed 1403 genes in blood-derived ctDNA that were previously revealed to play a role in tumorigenesis and the progression of cancer. Somatic mutations identified through ctDNA sequencing that match the results of multipoint exon sequencing in tumor tissues were detected, such as EGFR p.L861Q. These findings provide new insights into the intratumor heterogeneity and evolution of glioblastoma.

Knowledge of growth rates and growth patterns is useful for understanding tumor biology and planning treatment logistics.

Combining these two fits, we obtain a new type of Gompertz diffusion dynamics, which is a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Newly collected untreated human glioblastoma data in Seattle, US, re-verify our model. Instead of growth curves predicted by deterministic models, our SDE model predicts a band with a center curve as the tumor size average and its width as the tumor size variance over time. Given the glioblastoma size in a patient, our model can predict the patient survival time with a prescribed probability. The survival time is approximately a normal random variable with simple formulas for its mean and variance in terms of tumor sizes. Our model can be applied to studies of tumor treatments.

Methods: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, 30 patients with glioblastoma were retrospectively evaluated with DSC-MRI at a 3.0 Tesla scanner. Three groups of reviewers, including neuroradiologists, general radiologists, and radiology residents, calculated the rCBV based on the number of regions of interest (ROIs) and reference areas.

Variants are defined as being reliably indentified histologically and having some relevance for clinical outcome but as still being part of a previously defined overarching entity. Patterns of differentiation are identifiable by histological appearances but without clinical or pathological significance. Methods: The description of the histological and immunohistochemical features is based on the 2007 WHO classification. Results: In addition to the classic form of glioblastoma, two variants exist: the giant cell GBM and the gliosarcoma. The first but not the second would have a better outcome than the classic glioblastoma. The WHO classification also distinguishes several patterns of differentiation: small cells glioblastoma; glioblastoma with lipidized cells; glioblastoma with oligodendroglioma component; glioblastoma with heterologous differentiation. These patterns have to be recognized because they represent sometimes a diagnostic challenge. GFAP, Olig2 and Mib1/Ki67 are the most relevant immunohistochemical markers.

Oncologists should be aware that some newly diagnosed cases of GBM, specifically those called GBM/OLIGO, may behave as AOA. In the next few years we could observe two consequences of this: first, if anaplastic oligoastrocytomas with necrosis are now to be diagnosed as glioblastomas with oligodendroglioma component, obviously it must be expected that the incidence of glioblastoma will increase in these years; second, because these tumours with known longer median OS are now included in the group of glioblastomas, improvement in the survival of patients with glioblastoma in the next few years should be ascribed not only to advances in diagnosis and treatment but also to a semantic factor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21229290

We used advanced diffusion techniques and structural histopathology to distinguish these tumor entities on the basis of microstructural axonal and fibrillar signatures in the contrast-enhancing tumor component. Materials and methods: Contrast-enhancing tumor components were analyzed in 22 glioblastomas and 21 brain metastases on 3T MR imaging using DTI-fractional anisotropy, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging-orientation dispersion, and diffusion microstructural imaging-micro-fractional anisotropy. Available histopathologic specimens (10 glioblastomas and 9 metastases) were assessed for the presence of axonal structures and scored using 4-level scales for Bielschowsky staining (0: no axonal structures, 1: minimal axonal fragments preserved, 2: decreased axonal density, 3: no axonal loss) and glial fibrillary acid protein expression (0: no glial fibrillary acid protein positivity, 1: limited expression, 2: equivalent to surrounding parenchyma, 3: increased expression). Results: When we compared glioblastomas and metastases, fractional anisotropy was significantly increased and orientation dispersion was decreased in glioblastomas (each P < .001), with a significant shift toward increased glial fibrillary acid protein and Bielschowsky scores. Positive associations of fractional anisotropy and negative associations of orientation dispersion with glial fibrillary acid protein and Bielschowsky scores were revealed, whereas no association between micro-fractional anisotropy with glial fibrillary acid protein and Bielschowsky scores was detected. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed high predictive values of both fractional anisotropy (area under the curve = 0.8463) and orientation dispersion (area under the curve = 0.8398) regarding the presence of a glioblastoma. Conclusions: Diffusion imaging fractional anisotropy and orientation dispersion metrics correlated with histopathologic markers of directionality and may serve as imaging biomarkers in contrast-enhancing tumor components.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37884304

Histopathological investigation was performed by hematoxilyn-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD34, VEGF, VEGFR1/2, HIF-1α, CA9, and nestin as compared to eleven control glioblastomas to assess the differences in histological features, microvessel density, expression of VEGF and its receptors, tumor oxygenation, and status of glioma stem-like cells.In the six tumors resected under bevacizumab, microvascular proliferation was absent, and microvessel density had significantly decreased compared with that of the controls. The expressions of VEGF and its receptors were downregulated in two cases of partial response. HIF-1α or CA9 expression was decreased in five of the six tumors, whereas the decreased expression of these markers was noted in only one of the 11 control glioblastomas. The expression of nestin significantly decreased in the six tumors compared with that of the controls, with the remaining nestin-positive cells being relatively concentrated around vessels.We provide the first clinicopathological evidence that antiangiogenic therapy induces the apparent normalization of vascular structure, decrease of microvessel density, and improvement of tumor oxygenation in glioblastomas.

Several mono-target small molecule-inhibitors have been investigated as novel therapeutics, thus far with poor success. In this study we investigated the anticancer effects of SB747651A, a multi-target small-molecule inhibitor, in three well characterized patient-derived glioblastoma spheroid cultures and a murine orthotopic xenograft model. Concentrations of 5-10 µM SB747651A reduced cell proliferation, spheroid formation, migration and chemoresistance, while apoptotic cell death increased. Investigation of oncogenic kinase signaling showed decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR, CREB, GSK3 and GYS1 leading to altered glycogen metabolism and formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Expression levels of cancer stemness marker SOX2 were reduced in treated tumor cells and SB747651A treatment significantly prolonged survival of mice with intracranial glioblastoma xenografts, while no adverse effects were observed in vivo at doses of 25 mg/kg administered 5 days/week for 8 weeks. These findings suggest that SB747651A has anticancer effects in glioblastoma. The cancer-related pathophysiological mechanisms targeted by SB747651A are shared among many types of cancer; however, an in-depth clarification of the mechanisms of action in cancer cells is important before further potential application of SB747651A as an anticancer agent can be considered.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727611

Definition for inclusion in clinical trials of EMD 55900 was an immunohistochemical overexpression of grade 4+ or 3+ in a scale of 4 grades of staining quality. The use of the 4 different antibodies gave essentially equal results. In 21 cases, the immunohistochemical results were supplemented by molecular genetic analysis of EGFR amplification on the corresponding locus of chromosome 7, using frozen tissue from the same blocks after screening for vital tumor areas. Since no other material was available, the differential polymerase chain reaction technique was applied. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) served as a reference gene. In a preliminary experimental series with cases of known EGFR amplification, a densitometric EGFR/IFN-gamma ratio higher than 3 was determined as indicator for amplification of the EGFR gene. With this experimental approach we were able to identify an amplified EGFR gene in 13 specimens including 2 from recurrent glioblastomas in the same patients. All of these showed an increased immunoreactivity for EGFR protein.

"""Postoperative resveratrol administration improves prognosis of rat orthotopic glioblastomas.""","""Background: Although our previous study revealed lumbar punctured resveratrol could remarkably prolong the survival of rats bearing orthotopic glioblastomas, it also suggested the administration did not completely suppress rapid tumour growth. These evidences led us to consider that the prognosis of tumour-bearing rats may be further improved if this treatment is used in combination with neurosurgery. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the combined treatment on rat orthotopic glioblastomas. Methods: Rat RG2 glioblastoma cells were inoculated into the brains of 36 rats. The rats were subjected to partial tumour removal after they showed symptoms of intracranial hypertension. There were 28 rats that survived the surgery, and these animals were randomly and equally divided into the control group without postoperative treatment and the LP group treated with 100 μl of 300 μM resveratrol via the LP route. Resveratrol was administered 24 h after tumour resection in 3-day intervals, and the animals received 7 treatments. The intracranial tumour sizes, average life span, cell apoptosis and STAT3 signalling were evaluated by multiple experimental approaches in the tumour tissues harvested from both groups. Results: The results showed that 5 of the 14 (35.7%) rats in the LP group remained alive over 60 days without any sign of recurrence. The remaining nine animals had a longer mean postoperative survival time (11.0 ± 2.9 days) than that of the (7.3 + 1.3 days; p < 0.05) control group. The resveratrol-treated tumour tissues showed less Ki67 labelling, widely distributed apoptotic regions, upregulated PIAS3 expression and reduced p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that postoperative resveratrol administration efficiently improves the prognosis of rat advanced orthotopic glioblastoma via inhibition of growth, induction of apoptosis and inactivation of STAT3 signalling.

Robust Multichip Averaging was used to identify DEGs between the glioblastoma and non‑tumor samples. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs was also performed. Based on the TRANSFAC® database, TFs associated with the glioblastoma gene expression profile were used to construct a regulatory network. Furthermore, trimmed subnets were identified according to calculated Z‑scores. A total of 676 DEGs were identified, of which 190 were upregulated and 496 were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that the majority of these DEGs were functionally enriched in synaptic transmission, regulation of vesicle‑mediated transport and ion‑gated channel activity. In addition, the enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway included neuroactive ligand‑receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle. Based on the TRANSFAC® database, transcriptional regulatory networks with 2,246 nodes and 4,515 regulatory pairs were constructed.

"""High incidence of MGMT promoter methylation in primary glioblastomas without correlation with TP53 gene mutations.""","""O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) reduces cytotoxicity of therapeutic or environmental alkylating agents. MGMT promoter methylation has been associated with TP53 G: C to A:T transition mutations in various types of cancers, and with poor prognosis in patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Mutations of TP53 are more frequent in secondary than in primary glioblastoma, thus the expected MGMT promoter methylation was low in primary glioblastoma. Glioblastoma patients with MGMT promoter methylation showed better response to chemotherapy based on alkylating agents and longer survival than patients without MGMT methylation. We examined 32 primary glioblastomas, treated with radiotherapy and surgery, for TP53 mutation by direct sequencing and MGMT promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutations were detected in 72% and 31% of primary glioblastoma, respectively. Although not statistically significant, the frequency of TP53 G:C to A:T mutations were higher in cases with (26%) than without (11%) MGMT promoter methylation (p=0.376). MGMT promoter methylation had no impact on patient survival. Our data indicate that MGMT promoter methylation occurs frequently in primary glioblastoma, but does not lead to G:C to A:T TP53 mutations, has no independent prognostic value and is not a predictive marker unless glioblastoma patients are treated with chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19100509

In this work, we evaluated the expression and phosphorylation of mTOR, RAPTOR, and rpS6 in 195 human astrocytomas and 30 normal brain tissue samples. The expression of mTOR increased in glioblastomas, whereas mTOR phosphorylation, expression of RAPTOR, and expression and phosphorylation of rpS6 were similar between grades. Interestingly, the overexpression of total and phosphorylated mTOR as well as phosphorylated rpS6 (residues 240-244) were associated with wild-type IDH1 only glioblastomas. The expression and phosphorylation of mTOR and phosphorylation of rpS6 at residues 240-244 were associated with a worse prognosis in glioblastomas. Our results suggest that mTOR and rpS6 could be used as markers of overactivation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway and are predictive factors for overall survival in glioblastomas.

Some experiments in vitro and in vivo have been done and shown promising results, but have been never compared quantitatively with mathematical models. We use in vitro data of this virus applied to glioblastoma. Results: We describe three increasingly realistic mathematical models for the VSV-GBM in vitro experiment with progressive incorporation of time-delay effects. For the virus dynamics, we obtain results consistent with the in vitro experimental speed data only when applying the more complex and comprehensive model, with time-delay effects both in the reactive and diffusive terms. The tumor speed is given by the minimum of a very simple function that nonetheless yields results within the experimental measured range. Conclusions: We have improved a previous model with new ideas and carefully incorporated concepts from experimental results. We have shown that the delay time τ is the crucial parameter in this kind of models.

This is achieved by exploiting the extracellular water differences between vasogenic edema and infiltrative tissue and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-derived free water volume fraction. We obtained 85% accuracy in discriminating extracellular water differences between local patches in the peritumoral area of 66 glioblastomas and 40 metastatic patients in a cross-validation setting.

This level of accuracy surpasses CNNs trained on other conventional DTI-based measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), that have been used in other studies. Additionally, the CNN captures the peritumoral heterogeneity better than conventional texture features, including Gabor and radiomic features.

Methods: A retrospective study of surgically treated glioblastomas between March 2018 and November 2019 was performed. Patients with IOUS B-mode and strain elastography were included. After preprocessing, segmentation and extraction of radiomic features were performed with LIFEx software. An evaluation of semantic segmentation was carried out using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Using univariate correlations, radiomic features associated with OS were selected. Subsequently, survival analysis was conducted using Cox univariate regression and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: Sixteen patients were available for analysis. The DSC revealed excellent agreement for the segmentation of the tumour region. Of the 52 radiomic features, two texture features from B-mode (conventional mean and the grey-level zone length matrix/short-zone low grey-level emphasis [GLZLM_SZLGE]) and one texture feature from strain elastography (grey-level zone length matrix/long-zone high grey-level emphasis [GLZLM_LZHGE]) were significantly associated with OS.

Conventional T1w images and qT1 maps were obtained before and after gadolinium-based CA administration in 33 patients with glioblastoma before therapy. The following data were calculated: (i) absolute qT1-difference maps (qT1 pre-CA - qT1 post-CA), (ii) relative qT1-difference maps, (iii) absolute and (iv) relative differences of conventional T1w images acquired pre- and post-CA. The values of these four datasets were compared in four different regions: (a) the enhancing tumor, (b) the peritumoral edema, (c) a 5 mm zone around the pathology (defined as the sum of regions a and b), and (d) the contralateral normal appearing brain tissue. Additionally, absolute qT1-difference maps (displayed with linear gray scaling) were visually compared with respective conventional difference images. The enhancing tumor was visible both in the difference of conventional pre- and post-CA T1w images and in the absolute qT1-difference maps, whereas only the latter showed elevated values in the peritumoral edema and in some cases even beyond. Mean absolute qT1-difference values were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the enhancing tumor (838 ± 210 ms), the peritumoral edema (123 ± 74 ms) and in the 5 mm zone around the pathology (81 ± 31 ms) than in normal appearing tissue (32 ± 35 ms). In summary, absolute qT1-difference maps-in contrast to the difference of T1w images-of untreated glioblastomas appear to be able to visualize CA leakage, and thus might indicate tumor cell infiltration in the edema region and beyond.

Here, we examined this hypothesis using magnetic resonance (MR) images derived from 217 The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) glioblastoma subjects. Methods: Pre-operative MR images were segmented automatically into contrast enhancing (CE) tumor volumes using Iterative Probabilistic Voxel Labeling (IPVL). Distances were calculated from the centroid of CE tumor volumes to the SVZ and correlated with gene expression profiles of the corresponding glioblastomas. Correlative analyses were performed between SVZ distance, gene expression patterns, and clinical survival. Results: Glioblastoma located in proximity to the SVZ showed increased mRNA expression patterns associated with the cancer stem-cell state, including CD133 (P = 0.006). Consistent with the previous observations suggesting that glioblastoma stem cells exhibit increased DNA repair capacity, glioblastomas in proximity to the SVZ also showed increased expression of DNA repair genes, including MGMT (P = 0.018). Reflecting this enhanced DNA repair capacity, the genomes of glioblastomas in SVZ proximity harbored fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to those located distant to the SVZ (P = 0.003). Concordant with the notion that glioblastoma stem cells are more aggressive and refractory to therapy, patients with glioblastoma in proximity to SVZ exhibited poorer progression free and overall survival (P < 0.01). Conclusion: An unbiased analysis of TCIA suggests that glioblastomas located in proximity to the SVZ exhibited mRNA expression profiles associated with stem cell properties, increased DNA repair capacity, and is associated with poor clinical survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32556864
"""Stratification according to recursive partitioning analysis predicts outcome in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma accounts for more than half of diffuse gliomas. The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma remains poor despite comprehensive and intensive treatments. Furthermore, the clinical significance of molecular parameters and routinely available clinical variables for the prognosis prediction of glioblastomas remains limited. The authors describe a novel model may help in prognosis prediction and clinical management of glioblastoma patients. We performed a recursive partitioning analysis to generate three independent prognostic classes of 103 glioblastomas patients from TCGA dataset. Class I (MGMT promoter methylated, age <58), class II (MGMT promoter methylation, age ≥58; MGMT promoter unmethylation, age <54, KPS ≥70; MGMT promoter unmethylation, age >59, KPS ≥70), class III (MGMT promoter unmethylation, age 54-58, KPS ≥70; MGMT promoter unmethylation, KPS <70). Age, KPS and MGMT promoter methylation were the most significant prognostic factors for overall survival. The results were validated in CGGA dataset.This was the first study to combine various molecular parameters and clinical factors into recursive partitioning analysis to predict the prognosis of patients with glioblastomas. We included MGMT promoter methylation in our study, which could give better suggestion to patients for their chemotherapy. This clinical study will serve as the backbone for the future incorporation of molecular prognostic markers currently in development. Thus, our recursive partitioning analysis model for glioblastomas may aid in clinical prognosis evaluation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28496000
"""The early infiltrative phase of GBM hypothesis: are molecular glioblastomas histological glioblastomas in the making? A preliminary multicenter study.""","""Purpose: The presence of necrosis or microvascular proliferation was previously the hallmark for glioblastoma (GBM) diagnosis. The 2021 WHO classification now considers IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic tumors without the histological features of glioblastoma (that would have otherwise been classified as grade 2 or 3) as molecular GBM (molGBM) if they harbor any of the following molecular abnormalities: TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, or chromosomal + 7/-10 copy changes. We hypothesize that these tumors are early histological GBM and will eventually develop the classic histological features. Methods: Medical records from 65 consecutive patients diagnosed with molGBM at three tertiary-care centers from our institution were retrospectively reviewed from November 2017-October 2021. Only patients who underwent reoperation for tumor recurrence and whose tissue at initial diagnosis and recurrence was available were included in this study. The detailed clinical, histopathological, and radiographic scenarios are presented. Results: Five patients were included in our final cohort. Three (60%) patients underwent reoperation for recurrence in the primary site and 2 (40%) underwent reoperation for distal recurrence. Microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis were absent at initial diagnosis but present at recurrence in 4 (80%) patients. Radiographically, all tumors showed contrast enhancement, however none of them showed the classic radiographic features of GBM at initial diagnosis. Conclusions: In this manuscript we present preliminary data for a hypothesis that molGBMs are early histological GBMs diagnosed early in their natural history of disease and will eventually develop necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Further correlative studies are needed in support of this hypothesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35699848

Eleven week old F344 and ACI rats were given 100 or 200 p.p.m. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) solution as their drinking water for 42 weeks. Gliomas were induced at very high incidences (82.5-92.5%) in each group. Induced gliomas showed apparent evidence of morphologic malignancy by an analysis based on diagnostic criteria of human astrocytomas. All of the gliomas from the killed animals were classified histologically into subtypes according to the classification scheme used in the diagnosis of human gliomas. The majority of macrotumors more than 1 mm in diameter in both strains were diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells in these tumors were almost negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, while ultrastructurally neoplastic astrocytes contained glial filaments. A strain difference was observed in the ratio of histological subtypes of macrotumors. In F344 rats, astrocytic tumors diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas of an astrocytic type formed the majority, whereas glioblastomas of mixed oligo-astrocytic type predominated in ACI rats.

MRIs of 148 glioblastoma subjects from The Cancer Imaging Archive were segmented using Iterative Probabilistic Voxel Labeling (IPVL). Three aspects of contrast enhancement (CE) were parametrized: the mean intensity of all CE voxels (CEi), the intensity heterogeneity in CE (CEh), and volumetric ratio of CE to necrosis (CEr). Associations between these parameters and patterns of gene expression were analyzed using DAVID functional enrichment analysis. Glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) glioblastomas were poorly enhancing. Otherwise, no differences in CE parameters were found between proneural, neural, mesenchymal, and classical glioblastomas. High CEi was associated with expression of genes that mediate inflammatory responses. High CEh was associated with increased expression of genes that regulate remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and endothelial permeability. High CEr was associated with increased expression of genes that mediate cellular response to stressful metabolic states, including hypoxia and starvation. Our results indicate that CE in glioblastoma is associated with distinct biological processes involved in inflammatory response and tissue hypoxia.

"""TERT promoter mutations in primary and secondary glioblastomas.""","""Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is up-regulated in a variety of human neoplasms. Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed.

We also investigated the relationship between these methods and their usability in routine practice. Material and methods: RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the presence of IDH1-R132H mutation on the blocks of 70 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, and IDH1 stain was applied to the same blocks as IHC. Radiologically, preoperative magnetic resonance images of the patients were reviewed in terms of tumor size, localization, and presence of non-contrast-enhancing solid tumor component. Results: Evaluation by RT-PCR revealed that 15 (21.4%) patients were IDH-mutant, whereas IHC examination revealed 13 (18.6%) and radiological evaluation revealed 11 (15.7%) patients were IDH-mutant. There was a statistically significant difference between the IDH1 mutation detected by RT-PCR and by IHC or radiological methods (p=0.034 and p=0.000, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of IHC method in detecting IDH1 mutation were 86.6% and 100%, respectively, whereas those of radiological methods were 33.3% and 89%, respectively. Conclusion: Conclusively, radiological and IHC methods can be used in cases where RT-PCR cannot be applied for detecting IDH1 mutation.

"""Glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component have the same clinical phenotype as classical glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas are the commonest primary brain tumour and are considered one of the most heterogeneous tumour types. The introduction of a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component (GBM + O) in the latest WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (1) was to help with this. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether this tumour conferred a better prognosis than classical glioblastoma (GBM). The aim of this study was to study the clinical phenotype of these GBM + O tumours and compare it to the classical GBM. Materials and methods: All patients with histological evidence of a glioblastoma between 1st January 2007 and 31st January 2011 were identified from the Neuropathology Database. Clinical and radiological details were obtained for all patients. The overall survival of patients who were treated with chemoradiotherapy was obtained and the GBM + O cohort compared to the classical GBM cohort. Results: Three hundred and ninety-six patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were identified: 294 (74.2%) had classical GBM and 102 (25.6%) had GBM + O. The two cohorts presented at a similar age (61.1 years GBM + O vs. 63.2 years GBM; P = 0.09) and were matched for sex and side of the tumour. GBM + O were more likely to be located in the frontal lobes (38.2% for GBM + O vs. 27.2% for GBM: P = 0.04).

These tumors exhibit a high degree of vascularization, and malignant progression from astrocytoma to glioblastoma is often accompanied by increased angiogenesis and the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors. In this study, we investigated the in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) using human glioblastoma cell lines. Glioblastoma cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding BAI1 (AdBAI1), and Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively, demonstrated BAI1 mRNA and protein expression in the transduced tumor cells. Using an in vivo neovascularization assay, we found that angiogenesis surrounding AdBAI1-transduced glioblastoma cells transplanted into transparent skinfold chambers of SCID mice was significantly impaired compared to control treated cells. Additionally, in vivo inoculation with AdBAI1 of established subcutaneous or intracerebral transplanted tumors significantly impaired tumor growth and promoted increased mouse survival. Morphologically, the tumors exhibited signs of impaired angiogenesis, such as extensive necrosis and reduced intratumoral vascular density. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that BAI1 may be an excellent gene therapy candidate for the treatment of brain tumors, especially human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244591

Tumour lesions were segmented manually basing on the structural image of each patient, then registered to a standard brain atlas. Voxel-based regression analysis was subsequently performed to identify the specific brain regions that were associated with MMP-9 expression levels. Results: A significantly larger lesion volume of T2-hyperintensity was demonstrated in tumours with low MMP-9 expression compared to those with high MMP-9 expression (p=0.010). No significant difference was found in the lesion volumes of the contrast enhancement areas between the two groups (p=0.452). The major correlated cluster with high MMP-9 expression was identified in the right frontal lobe, while a cluster located at the posterior region of the right lateral ventricle was correlated with low MMP-9 expression.

Immunofluorescence was adopted for detecting glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein H (gH) of HCMV's in glioblastoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier Analysis and Chi Square were used to evaluate patients' survival and the association between HCMV infection and patients' characteristics respectively.

"""The prognostic role of IDH mutations in homogeneously treated patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.""","""The detection of IDH mutations in patients with diffusely infiltrating malignant astrocytomas resulted in substantial modifications in the concept of WHO classification of these tumors. An important underlying observation was that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) without IDH mutation had a clinical course similar to that of patients with glioblastomas (GBM). The underlying observations of the German Glioma Network and NOA-04, however, were based on mixed patient cohorts. While most GBM patients received combined radiochemotherapy, patients with AA usually had radiotherapy or chemotherapy only. This intrinsic shortcoming of the study raised the question of whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III, might have better prognosis if treated with combined radiochemotherapy than patients with GBM receiving the same combination therapy. Thus, the question remains whether the established histopathological grading criteria for malignant astrocytomas in the absence of an IDH mutation are still important if neither vascular proliferation nor necrosis are detectable. All patients in the cohort investigated here with the diagnosis of AA or GBM were subjected to a combined radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol independently of the histopathological diagnosis. Thus, the analysis of these patients allows to clarify whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III have a prognosis similar to that of GBM, IDH wildtype, WHO grade IV, even under equivalent therapeutic conditions. We determined the IDH1 and IDH2 status by sequencing, the MGMT status by pyrosequencing after bisulfite treatment and the EGFR status of the patients by FISH. In fact, the patients with the histopathological diagnosis of an AA IDH wild-type under similar aggressive therapy showed a comparable and therefore no better prognosis (median overall survival (mOS) 16 months) than patients with a GBM (mOS 13 months). Instead, patients with an AA and an IDH mutation receiving the same therapy had a mOS of 54 months. Thus, it can be concluded that in the absence of an IDH mutation, the established histopathological grading criteria 'necrosis' and 'vascular proliferation' actually lose their prognostic significance. If, on the other hand, patients with malignant astrocytomas and an IDH mutation are examined, there is still a difference between patients with necrosis and/or vascular proliferation and those whose tumors do not show such characteristics. Accordingly, in patients with malignant astrocytomas with IDH mutation it can be concluded that a histological differentiation between AA IDH mutated and GBM IDH mutated remains beneficial from a prognostic perspective.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31623667
"""Early-Stage Glioblastomas: MR Imaging-Based Classification and Imaging Evidence of Progressive Growth.""","""Background and purpose: The serial imaging changes describing the growth of glioblastomas from small to large tumors are seldom reported. Our aim was to classify the imaging patterns of early-stage glioblastomas and to define the order of appearance of different imaging patterns that occur during the growth of small glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Medical records and preoperative MR imaging studies of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Patients were included if their MR imaging studies showed early-stage glioblastomas, defined as small MR imaging lesions detected early in the course of the disease, demonstrating abnormal signal intensity but the absence of classic imaging findings of glioblastoma. Each lesion was reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists independently for location, signal intensity, involvement of GM and/or WM, and contrast-enhancement pattern on MR imaging. Results: Twenty-six patients with 31 preoperative MR imaging studies met the inclusion criteria. Early-stage glioblastomas were classified into 3 types and were all hyperintense on FLAIR/T2-weighted images. Type I lesions predominantly involved cortical GM (n = 3). Type II (n = 12) and III (n = 16) lesions involved both cortical GM and subcortical WM. Focal contrast enhancement was present only in type III lesions at the gray-white junction. Interobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.95; P < .001) for lesion-type classification. Transformations of lesions from type I to type II and type II to type III were observed on follow-up MR imaging studies. The early-stage glioblastomas of 16 patients were pathologically confirmed after imaging progression to classic glioblastoma.

"""Visualization of angiographical arteriovenous shunting in perisylvian glioblastomas.""","""Background: Arteriovenous shunting visualized by angiography is one of the major features of glioblastomas, and the visualization is dependent on the presence of extensive shunting. Extensive arteriovenous shunting is associated with the risk of poorly controlled intraoperative bleeding. When a tumor with extensive arteriovenous shunting is located in close proximity to the eloquent regions of the brain, a meticulous surgical procedure is necessary. In the present study, the site-oriented visualization of angiographical arteriovenous shunting was evaluated from the perspective of surgical treatment, with a particular focus on the perisylvian region that is in close proximity to motor and language regions (dominant hemisphere), as well as large arteries and veins. Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients underwent a resection of glioblastoma between February 2007 and September 2012. All patients were presurgically examined using digital subtraction angiography. The patients were subdivided into the following two groups based on the location of the tumor: 1) perisylvian glioblastoma (18 patients) and 2) non-perisylvian glioblastoma (eight patients). Angiography to detect the arteriovenous shunting was performed. In addition, the number of intratumoral vessels, tumor proliferative activity (MIB-1 labeling index), and volume of intraoperative bleeding were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Results: Angiographical arteriovenous shunting was definitively visualized in 13 of 18 (72 %) perisylvian glioblastomas, in contrast to only one of eight (13 %) non-perisylvian glioblastomas (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the number of intratumoral vessels, MIB-1 labeling index, and volume of intraoperative bleeding. However, massive intraoperative bleeding of > 2,000 mL occurred in one perisylvian glioblastoma patient. Conclusions: Glioblastomas in the perisylvian region tend to be associated with extensive arteriovenous shunting that can be definitively visualized by performing an angiography. Because arteriovenous shunting carries the risk of intraoperative bleeding, perisylvian glioblastomas-particularly in the dominant hemisphere-should be resected with a meticulous surgical procedure and strategy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23435867

Recent work has highlighted the role of the transcription factor RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor, REST in glioblastoma but how REST function correlates with disease outcome has not been described. Method: Using a bioinformatic approach and mining of publicly available microarray datasets, we describe an aggressive subtype of gliomas defined by a gene signature derived from REST. Using this REST gene signature we predict that REST function is enhanced in advanced glioblastoma. We compare disease outcomes between tumors based on REST status and treatment regimen, and describe downstream targets of REST that may contribute to the decreased benefits observed with high dose chemotherapy in REM tumors. Results: We present human data showing that patients with 'REST Enhanced Malignancies' (REM) tumors present with a shorter disease free survival compared to non-REM gliomas. Importantly, REM tumors are refractory to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and patients fail to respond to this line of treatment.

"""Identification of Hedgehog pathway responsive glioblastomas by isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation.""","""The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway regulates the growth of a subset of adult gliomas and better definition of Hh-responsive subtypes could enhance the clinical utility of monitoring and targeting this pathway in patients. Somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes occur frequently in WHO grades II and III gliomas and WHO grade IV secondary glioblastomas. Hh pathway activation in WHO grades II and III gliomas suggests that it might also be operational in glioblastomas that developed from lower-grade lesions. To evaluate this possibility and to better define the molecular and histopathological glioma subtypes that are Hh-responsive, IDH genes were sequenced in adult glioma specimens assayed for an operant Hh pathway. The proportions of grades II-IV specimens with IDH mutations correlated with the proportions that expressed elevated levels of the Hh gene target PTCH1. Indices of an operational Hh pathway were measured in all primary cultures and xenografts derived from IDH-mutant glioma specimens, including IDH-mutant glioblastomas. In contrast, the Hh pathway was not operational in glioblastomas that lacked IDH mutation or history of antecedent lower-grade disease. IDH mutation is not required for an operant pathway however, as significant Hh pathway modulation was also measured in grade III gliomas with wild-type IDH sequences. These results indicate that the Hh pathway is operational in grades II and III gliomas and glioblastomas with molecular or histopathological evidence for evolvement from lower-grade gliomas.

However, whether other angiogenic cytokines are also differentially expressed in these glioblastoma subtypes is not known so far, but this knowledge might be important to optimize an antiangiogenic therapy. Therefore, we studied the expression of several angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF-A, HGF, bFGF, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, G-CSF and GM-CSF in pGBMs and sGBMs as well as in gliomas WHO III, the precursor lesions of sGBMs. In tumor tissues, expression of all cytokines was observed albeit with marked differences concerning intensity and distribution pattern. Quantification of the cytokines in the supernatant of 30 tissue-corresponding glioma cultures revealed a predominant expression of VEGF-A in pGBMs and significantly higher expression levels of PDGF-AB in sGBMs. HGF and bFGF were determined in nearly all tumor cultures but with no GBM subtype or malignancy-related differences. Interestingly, GM-CSF and especially G-CSF were produced less frequently by tumor cells. However, GM-CSF secretion occurred together with an increased number of simultaneously secreted cytokines and correlated with a worse patient prognosis and may thus represent a more aggressive angiogenic phenotype. Finally, we confirmed an independent contribution of each tumor-derived cytokine analyzed to tumor-induced vascularization. Our data indicate that an optimal antiangiogenic therapy may require targeting of multiple angiogenic pathways that seem to differ markedly in pGBMs and sGBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16331629

These patients underwent contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) examination, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). We generated a set of MR biomarkers, including relative cerebral blood volume in the enhancing region, and fractional anisotropy measured in the immediate peritumoral area. We then generated a Bayesian network model to represent associations among these imaging-derived predictors, and the group membership variable, (glioblastoma or solitary metastasis). This Bayesian network can be used to classify new patients' tumors based on their MR appearance. The Bayesian network model accurately differentiated glioblastomas from solitary metastases. Prediction accuracy was 0.94 (sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.92) based on leave-one-out cross-validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90. A Bayesian network-based decision support system accurately differentiates glioblastomas from solitary metastases, based on MR-derived biomarkers.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23859240
"""Use of personalized molecular biomarkers in the clinical care of adults with glioblastomas.""","""This study was conducted to assess the current pattern of use and the impact of available molecular predictive and prognostic biomarkers on clinical care in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). An online questionnaire consisting of 15 questions about the frequency of use and clinical utility of tissue-based molecular tests was distributed to 1,053 members of the Neuro-Oncology Community in the United States. A total of 320 responses (30.4 %) were collected. 73 respondents who did not see GBM patients were excluded from analysis. MGMT promoter methylation testing (MGMT-meth) was the most commonly requested (37.2; 95 % CI, 31-44), followed by EGFR amplification (22.7; 95 % CI, 18-28), co-deletion of 1p/19q (22.3 %), EGFR expression (21.5 %), P53 mutation (19.8 %), PTEN mutation or deletion (17.4 %), EGFRvIII mutation (12.1 %), IDH1/2 mutation (12.1 %), PDGFR (4.5 %), and PIK3CA (0.8 %). The perceived utility of these studies was variable between participants. A small percentage of respondents felt that any of the studies were 'always' or 'almost always' helpful in clinical decision making (MGMT-meth 10.9 %; range, 0-13.8 %), but more frequently 'never' or 'almost never' helpful (MGMT-meth 25.9 %; range, 25-54.7 %). 26.7 % reported not to routinely order any of these studies. Although molecular markers are frequently ordered for patients with GBM, only a minority of clinicians ordering these tests report that the results influence clinical decision-making. Molecular markers that are likely to affect patient care should be ordered with the goal to maximize benefit for patients and to avoid non-actionable results and additional costs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22930388
"""Association of stem cell marker CD133 expression with dissemination of glioblastomas.""","""Dissemination of glioblastoma was once considered rare but is now increasingly encountered with longer survival of glioblastoma patients. Despite the potential negative impact of dissemination on clinical outcome, however, molecular markers useful for prediction of dissemination risk still remains ill defined. We tested in this study for an association between the expression of stem cell marker CD133 and the risk of dissemination in 26 cases of glioblastoma (16 with dissemination and 10 without dissemination). The protein expression of CD133 was examined by western blot analysis of tumor specimens, and the CD133 expression levels were quantified by densitometry and normalized to beta-actin. The results indicated that CD133 expression levels are significantly higher in glioblastomas with dissemination (mean 10.3, range 0.20-27.8) than in those without (mean 1.18, range 0.07-3.58). The results suggest that CD133 could be a molecular predictor of glioblastoma dissemination, and also give rise to an intriguing idea that CD133-positive cancer stem cells may be implicated in the initiation of disseminated lesions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20135187
"""Characterization of genes with increased expression in human glioblastomas.""","""In the present study, we have used the gene expression data available in the SAGE database in an attempt to identify glioblastoma molecular markers. Of 129 genes with more than 5-fold difference found by comparison of nine glioblastoma with five normal brain SAGE libraries, 44 increased their expression in glioblastomas. Most corresponding proteins were involved in angiogenesis, host-tumor immune interplay, multidrug resistance, extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, IGF-signalling, or MAP-kinase pathway. Among them, 16 genes had a high expression both in glioblastomas and in glioblastoma cell lines suggesting their expression in transformed cells. Other 28 genes had an increased expression only in glioblastomas, not in glioblastoma cell lines suggesting an expression possibly originated from host cells. Many of these genes are among the top transcripts in activated macrophages, and involved in immune response and angiogenesis. This altered pattern of gene expression in both host and tumor cells, can be viewed as a molecular marker in the analysis of malignant progression of astrocytic tumors, and as possible clues for the mechanism of disease. Moreover, several genes overexpressed in glioblastomas produce extracellular proteins, thereby providing possible therapeutic targets. Further characterization of these genes will thus allow them to be exploited in molecular classification of glial tumors, diagnosis, prognosis, and anticancer therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16396319

"""Pre-operative hematological markers as predictive factors for overall survival and progression free survival in glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Several hematological factors, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutrition index (PNI) and albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), have been highlighted as systemic worse prognostic parameters for the outcome in gliomas. The aim of this study is to identify some pre-operative routinely blood tests as predictive parameters for the Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) in glioblastoma (GBM). Materials and methods: From January 2013 to April 2019, 124 patients operated for glioblastoma were analyzed. Data were collected regarding age, sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), IDH status, the extent of resection (EOR) and adjuvant therapy. The hematological parameters were collected at admission: neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, NLR, PLR, AGR and PNI. The OS and the PFS were considered as the end-point for the evaluation of the predictive factors. Results: A pre-operative neutrophil count > 7 × 109/L was a worse prognostic factor for OS and PFS at univariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.025), as well as hypo-albuminemia. Thrombocytosis, lymphopenia and NLR > 4 were associated to a worse OS, at uni- and multivariate analysis, resulting as poor predictive parameters, independently to EOR, the IDH mutation and the adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: Still nowadays there are no sensitive or specific hematological markers which are routinely applied for detecting and monitoring the treatment-response and the prognosis of glioblastoma. In our study, a pre-operative low cost and widely used blood markers, such as NLR, lymphocytes and platelets could be predictable prognostic factors for the Overall Survival of patients affected by glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32890893
"""A tailored next-generation sequencing panel identified distinct subtypes of wildtype IDH and TERT promoter glioblastomas.""","""Central nervous system tumors are classified based on an integrated diagnosis combining histology and molecular characteristics, including IDH1/2 and H3-K27M mutations, as well as 1p/19q codeletion. Here, we aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of a glioma-tailored 48-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for integrated glioma diagnosis. We designed a glioma-tailored 48-gene NGS panel for detecting 1p/19q codeletion and mutations in IDH1/2, TP53, PTEN, PDGFRA, NF1, RB1, CDKN2A/B, CDK4, and the TERT promoter (TERTp). We analyzed 106 glioma patients (grade II: 19 cases, grade III: 23 cases, grade IV: 64 cases) using this system. The 1p/19q codeletion was detected precisely in oligodendroglial tumors using our NGS panel. In a cohort of 64 grade Ⅳ gliomas, we identified 56 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Within these IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, 33 samples (58.9%) showed a mutation in TERTp. Notably, PDGFRA mutations and their amplification were more commonly seen in TERTp-wildtype glioblastomas (43%) than in TERTp-mutant glioblastomas (6%) (P = .001). Hierarchical molecular classification of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas revealed 3 distinct groups of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. One major cluster was characterized by mutations in PDGFRA, amplification of CDK4 and PDGFRA, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, and absence of TERTp mutations. This cluster was significantly associated with older age (P = .021), higher Ki-67 score (P = .007), poor prognosis (P = .012), and a periventricular tumor location. We report the development of a glioma-tailored NGS panel for detecting 1p/19q codeletion and driver gene mutations on a single platform.

"""Novel chemo-sensitizing agent, ERW1227B, impairs cellular motility and enhances cell death in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas display variable phenotypes that include increased drug-resistance associated with enhanced migratory and anti-apoptotic characteristics. These shared characteristics contribute to failure of clinical treatment regimens. Identification of novel compounds that promote cell death and impair cellular motility is a logical strategy to develop more effective clinical protocols. We recently described the ability of the small molecule, KCC009, a tissue transglutaminase (TG2) inhibitor, to sensitize glioblastoma cells to chemotherapy. In the current study, we synthesized a series of related compounds that show variable ability to promote cell death and impair motility in glioblastomas, irrespective of their ability to inhibit TG2. Each compound has a 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroisoxazole component that presumably reacts with nucleophilic cysteine thiol residues in the active sites of proteins that have an affinity to the small molecule. Our studies focused on the effects of the compound, ERW1227B. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with ERW1227B was associated with both down-regulation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, which enhanced cell death; as well as disruption of focal adhesive complexes and intracellular actin fibers, which impaired cellular mobility. Bioassays as well as time-lapse photography of glioblastoma cells treated with ERW1227B showed cell death and rapid loss of cellular motility. Mice studies with in vivo glioblastoma models demonstrated the ability of ERW1227B to sensitize tumor cells to cell death after treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation. The above findings identify ERW1227B as a potential novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20824305
"""Glycosylation-related gene expression is linked to differentiation status in glioblastomas undifferentiated cells.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor with still poor prognosis. Tumor initiation, growth and recurrences might depend on Brain Tumor Stem Cells (BTSCs) which can promote tumor aggressiveness and potentially affords new therapeutic target. Recent works emphasized aberrant cell-surface glyco-conjugate expression in brain tumors suggesting that altered glycosylation is closely linked to cancer tumor metastasis and invasive process. Post-translational changes might play a key role in determining the fates of most aggressive and undifferentiated cells such as self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. In order to characterize the glycosylation-related genes involved in differentiation status of the BTSCs, two glioblastoma cell lines, U87-MG and U251 have been cultured according to two conditions leading to undifferentiated floating cells or differentiated adherent cells. The expression level of 559 glycosylation related genes has been analyzed by Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) analysis and allowed to isolate eight up-regulated genes specific of a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells. Protein expression has been confirmed. Among main selected genes, five are also over-expressed in the undifferentiated condition in primary cultures provided by three GBM freshly isolated from patient. This work suggests that new Glycosylation-related gene signature might improve the characterization of the most aggressive and undifferentiated cells and supports that in future, N-linked glycosylation might provide new target to develop therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21899947
"""IDH1 mutations as molecular signature and predictive factor of secondary glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To establish the frequency of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas at a population level, and to assess whether they allow reliable discrimination between primary (de novo) glioblastomas and secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma. Experimental design: We screened glioblastomas from a population-based study for IDH1 mutations and correlated them with clinical data and other genetic alterations. Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8%). Glioblastoma patients with IDH1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with EGFR amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean, 27.1 versus 11.3 months; P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377; 3.7%: P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corresponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95% of cases. Glioblastomas with IDH1 mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of secondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without IDH1 mutations clinically diagnosed as secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggesting that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been misclassified, possibly due to histologic sampling error. Conclusion: IDH1 mutations are a strong predictor of a more favorable prognosis and a highly selective molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas that complements clinical criteria for distinguishing them from primary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19755387

"""MicroRNA expression patterns in the malignant progression of gliomas and a 5-microRNA signature for prognosis.""","""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are directly involved in the progression in various cancers. To date, no systematic researches have been performed on the expression pattern of miRNA during progression from low grade gliomas to anaplastic gliomas or secondary glioblastomas and those prognostic miRNAs in anaplastic gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. In the present study, high-throughput microarrays were used to measure miRNA expression levels in 116 samples in the different progression stages of glioma. We found that miRNA expression pattern totally altered when low grade gliomas progressed to anaplastic gliomas or secondary glioblastomas. However, anaplastic gliomas and secondary glioblastomas have similar expression pattern in miRNA level. Furthermore, we developed a five-miRNA signature (two protective miRNAs-miR-767-5p, miR-105; three risky miRNAs: miR-584, miR-296-5p and miR-196a) that could identify patients with a high risk of unfavorable outcome in anaplastic gliomas regardless of histology type. It should be highlighted that the five-miRNA signature can also identify patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome in secondary and TCGA Proneural glioblastomas, but not Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal glioblastomas. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miRNA expression patterns in the malignant progression of gliomas and a novel prognostic classifier, the five-miRNA signature, serve as a prognostic marker for patient risk stratification in anaplastic gliomas, Secondary and Proneural glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25415048
"""Refined efficacy and outcome estimates of surgical treatment in oldest-old patients with glioblastomas based on competing risk model and conditional survival analysis: A surveillance, epidemiology, and end results population-based study.""","""Background and purpose: To determine the refined estimates of the surgical effects on the short- and long-term prognoses of oldest-old patients (aged ≥80 years) with glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry, we identified the oldest-old patients with glioblastomas between 2005 and 2016. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis, and competing risk model were used to assess the curative efficacy of the surgical treatments. Stratification and interaction analysis were performed to explore the potential interaction effects. The conditional survival rates were calculated to explore the longitudinal change in the survival probability over time. Results: This study enrolled 3309 patients with a median overall survival of 3 months. The overall survival differed significantly among the different surgical groups. Considering the gross total resection as reference, subtotal resection presented adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.197 (1.052-1.362; p < 0.001); biopsy/partial resection, 1.242 (1.083-1.424; p = 0.002); and no surgery, 1.309 (1.145-1.497; p < 0.006). Age ≥ 83 years, widowed/other status, tumor size 4-5 cm, and temporal tumors showed significant interaction effects. The adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of radical resection was 0.729 (0.645-0.825; p < 0.001). Based on disease-specific survival, the 1-year survival rate was 18% and 26% for the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 1-year conditional survival rates in the second year were 54% and 39% in the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 3-year survival rates were 10% in both the groups. Conclusions: Radical surgery may have short-term benefits in the oldest-old patients with glioblastoma, with a significant increase in the 1-year survival rate. However, its contribution in the long-term outcome is limited due to decreased conditional survival rates from the second year after surgery. Prudent patient selection and improved postoperative management may be needed to promote the therapeutic efficacy of tumor resection synergistically.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35930955

Methods: The conventional MRI, DWI, and DSC-PWI results of 120 adult patients with IDH wild-type glioblastomas were reviewed retrospectively and their efficacy was analysed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test. Relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADCmin) and relative maximum cerebral blood volume (rCBVmax) values were compared between glioblastomas with different molecular statuses using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression were used to evaluate predictive performance. Results: Glioblastomas with a high p53 LI were more likely to show a well-defined enhancement margin (p=0.047). Glioblastomas in the high-Ki-67-LI group demonstrated significantly lower rADCmin (p<0.001) and higher rCBVmax (p=0.001) values than those in the low-Ki-67-LI group. Tumours without MGMT promoter methylation showed lower rADCmin (p<0.001) and higher rCBVmax (p<0.001) values than those with it. The rCBVmax value exhibited a greater efficacy in predicting the MGMT promoter methylation status of adult IDH wild-type glioblastomas than the rADCmin value (p=0.001).

Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the conventional MRI (cMRI), DWI and DSC-PWI obtained from 10 patients with IDH-mutated (IDH-m) glioblastomas and 65 patients with IDH wild-type (IDH-w) glioblastomas. Features of cMRI, relative minimum ADC in the enhancing region (rADCmin-t) and peri-enhancing area (rADCmin-p), and relative maximum CBV values in the enhancing region (rCBVmax-t) and peri-enhancing region (rCBVmax-p) were compared between two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis were used to assess diagnostic performance. Results: IDH-m glioblastomas tended to present in frontal lobes and younger patients. The rADCmin-t (P = 0.042) were significantly lower in IDH-w than IDH-m. Both rCBVmax-t and rCBVmax-p showed significant differences between two subgroups (all P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values in prediction of IDH-m were >0.98 for rADCmin-t, <7.27 for rCBVmax-t, and < 0.97 for rCBVmax-p. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the combination of rADCmin-t and rCBVmax-t yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity.

To identify the parvovirus(es) with the optimal oncolytic effect against human glioblastomas, we screened 12 parvoviruses at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). MVMi, MVMc, MVM-G17, tumor virus X (TVX), canine parvovirus (CPV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), rat parvovirus 1A (RPV1A), and H-3 were relatively ineffective. The four viruses with the greatest oncolytic activity, LuIII, H-1, MVMp, and MVM-G52, were tested for the ability, at a low MOI, to progressively infect the culture over time, causing cell death at a rate higher than that of cell proliferation. LuIII alone was effective in all five human glioblastomas tested. H-1 progressively infected only two of five; MVMp and MVM-G52 were ineffective in all five. To investigate the underlying mechanism of LuIII's phenotype, we used recombinant parvoviruses with the LuIII capsid replacing the MVMp capsid or with molecular alteration of the P4 promoter. The LuIII capsid enhanced efficient replication and oncolysis in MO59J gliomas cells; other gliomas tested required the entire LuIII genome to exhibit enhanced infection. LuIII selectively infected glioma cells over normal glial cells in vitro. In mouse models, human glioblastoma xenografts were selectively infected by LuIII when administered intratumorally; LuIII reduced tumor growth by 75%.

"""p53 mutations versus EGF receptor expression in giant cell glioblastomas.""","""Recent studies have shown that there are distinct genetic pathways leading to the most malignant astrocytic neoplasm, the glioblastoma. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas are characterized by amplification/overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and, less frequently, of the MDM2 gene. Another pathway, operative in the progression of low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas to secondary glioblastomas, is characterized by the frequent occurrence of p53 mutations. In this study, we assessed p53 mutations and EGFR expression in the giant cell glioblastoma. This rare variant is characterized by unusually large, multinucleated giant cells, but tends to be more confined and has been reported to carry a somewhat more favorable prognosis. We analyzed biopsies from 16 patients (mean age at clinical manifestation, 40 years). DNA sequencing revealed that 12 of 16 (75%) giant cell glioblastomas contained a p53 mutation. In 7 patients with two or more surgical interventions, the p53 mutation was already detected in the first biopsy. Focal EGFR overexpression, including multinucleated giant cells, was observed immunohistochemically in 9 of 16 (56%) tumors. However, most tumor areas lacked immunoreactivity, indicating that EGFR overexpression does not play a significant role in the evolution of this glioblastoma variant.

"""MSH6 mutations arise in glioblastomas during temozolomide therapy and mediate temozolomide resistance.""","""Purpose: Over the past few years, the alkylating agent temozolomide has become the standard-of-care therapy for patients with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor. Recently, large-scale cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified a hypermutation phenotype and inactivating MSH6 mismatch repair gene mutations in recurrent, post-temozolomide glioblastomas, particularly those growing more rapidly during temozolomide treatment. This study aimed to clarify the timing and role of MSH6 mutations in mediating glioblastoma temozolomide resistance. Experimental design: MSH6 sequence and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were determined in matched prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy glioblastomas identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as having posttreatment MSH6 mutations. Temozolomide-resistant lines were derived in vitro through selective growth under temozolomide, and the MSH6 gene was sequenced in resistant clones. The role of MSH6 inactivation in mediating resistance was explored using lentiviral short hairpin RNA knockdown and MSH6 reconstitution. Results: MSH6 mutations were confirmed in posttreatment TCGA glioblastomas but absent in matched pretreatment tumors. The posttreatment hypermutation phenotype displayed a signature bias toward CpC transitions and was not associated with MSI. In vitro modeling through exposure of an MSH6 wild-type glioblastoma line to temozolomide resulted in resistant clones; one clone showed an MSH6 mutation, Thr(1219)Ile, that had been independently noted in two treated TCGA glioblastomas. Knockdown of MSH6 in the glioblastoma line U251 increased resistance to temozolomide cytotoxicity and reconstitution restored cytotoxicity in MSH6-null glioma cells.

MicroRNAs determine the cell fate in glioblastomas. However, relationships between IGF-1 signaling and miRNAs in glioblastoma pathogenesis are still unclear. Our aim was to validate the IGF-1-mediated mRNA/miRNA regulatory network in glioblastomas. Using in silico analyses of mRNA array and RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 32 core enrichment genes that were highly associated with IGF-1-promoted cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. To investigate the IGF-1-downregulated miRNA signature, microarray-based approaches with IGF-1-treated U87-MG cells and array data in TCGA were used. Four miRNAs, including microRNA (miR)-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-181d, and miR-130b, exhibited an inverse correlation with IGF-1 levels. The miR-181d, that targeted the most IGF-1-related cytokine genes, was significantly reduced in IGF-1-treated glioma cells. Statistical models incorporating both high-IGF-1 and low-miR-181d statuses better predicted poor patient survival, and can be used as an independent prognostic factor in glioblastomas. The C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) and interleukin (IL)-1b demonstrated inverse correlations with miR-181d levels and associations with patient survival. miR-181d significantly attenuated IGF-1-upregulated CCR1 and IL-1b gene expressions.

"""High Interobserver Agreement in the Subjective Classification of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Fluorescence Levels in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastomas.""","""Background and objectives: Fluorescence-guided resection of glioblastomas (GBM) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) improves intraoperative tumor visualization and is thus widely used nowadays. During resection, different fluorescence levels can usually be distinguished within the same tumor. Recently, we demonstrated that strong, vague, and no fluorescence correspond to distinct histopathological characteristics in newly diagnosed GBM. However, the qualitative fluorescence classification by the neurosurgeon is subjective and currently no comprehensive data on interobserver variability is available. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the interobserver variability in the classification of 5-ALA fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed GBM. Study design/materials and methods: A questionnaire investigating the interobserver variability in 5-ALA fluorescence quantification was performed at a nation-wide neurosurgical oncology meeting. The participants involved in the neurosurgical/neurooncological field were asked to categorize 30 cases of 5-ALA fluorescence images derived from GBM resection on a lecture hall screen according to the widely used three-tier fluorescence classification scheme (negative, vague, or strong fluorescence). Additionally, participants were asked for information on their medical background such as specialty, level of training, and experience with 5-ALA fluorescence-guided procedures. Interobserver agreement was defined as the calculated mean κ values for each observer. Results: A total of 36 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The mean average κ value in fluorescence classification within the entire cohort was 0.71 ± 0.12 and 29 (81%) participants had a substantial or almost perfect interobserver agreement (κ values 0.6-1.0). Interobserver agreement was significantly higher in neurosurgeons (mean κ: 0.83) as compared with non-neurosurgeons involved in the neurooncological field (mean κ: 0.52; P < 0.001). Furthermore, interobserver agreement was significantly higher in participants who had experience with at least 25 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgeries (mean κ: 0.87) compared with less experienced colleagues (mean κ: 0.82; P = 0.039). Conclusion: Our study found a high interobserver agreement in the qualitative classification of different 5-ALA fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed GBM. Interobserver agreement increases significantly in more experienced participants and therefore a high level of experience is crucial for reliable intraoperative fluorescence classification.

"""Diffusion tensor invasive phenotypes can predict progression-free survival in glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas multiformes (GBM) remain incurable in most cases. Their invasion into normal brain makes current therapies ineffective. Post-mortem studies suggest about a 25% of GBMs invade less than 1 cm from the tumour bulk and 20% invade more than 3 cm. Aim of study: The study aims to use DTI to assess tumour extension and determine how previously reported patterns relate to the progression-free survival (PFS). Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients with GBM treated according to the EORTC/NCIC protocol were retrospectively analysed. Patients were imaged post-operatively at 1.5 T. The sequences were composed of standard anatomical and a standard DTI sequence. As described earlier p and q maps were constructed. For each of the p and q maps, regions of interest were drawn around the visible abnormality. Patients were assigned a diffuse, localised or minimally invasive pattern. Progression was defined according to the RANO criteria (4) and PFS determined in days. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival for the three groups were plotted as were the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 24 months. Results: The median PFS for the diffuse group was 278 days, for the localised group 605 days and 820 days for the minimally invasive group. Three-fourth of the minimally invasive group were progression-free at 24 months (LOG RANK 9.25; p = 0.010). Conclusion: It is possible to identify three invasive phenotypes in GBMs using Diffusion tensor imaging , and these three phenotypes have different progression free survival. A minimal phenotype (20% of patients) predicts a greater delay to progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23445331
"""The differences of water diffusion between brain tissue infiltrated by tumor and peritumoral vasogenic edema.""","""The differences between peritumoral brain tissue infiltrated by tumor and vasogenic edema were prospectively evaluated by comparing the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of peritumoral areas of infiltrative tumors (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) to that of peritumoral areas of noninfiltrative tumors (metastatic carcinomas) on 54 patients. Peritumoral ADCs indicated the possibility of differentiation between tumor infiltration and vasogenic edema, as well as between primary gliomas and metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19237051
"""Clinicopathological features and molecular analysis of primary glioblastomas in Moroccan patients.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Primary and secondary glioblastomas develop through different genetic pathways. The aim of this study was to determinate the genetic and clinical features of primary glioblastoma in Moroccan patients. The blood and tumor samples were obtained from a group of 34 Moroccan patients affected with primary glioblastoma. The tumors were investigated for TP53, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations using PCR sequencing analysis. Clinicopathological data showed that the mean age at diagnosis of patients was 50.06 years, the sex ratio was 11 F/23 M, and the median of Karnofsky performance score was 60. About 18 % of patients were initially treated by total tumor resection, 41 % by subtotal, and 38 % by partial resection, but biopsy was performed for a single patient (3 %). Twenty-five patients (74 %) received radiotherapy. In addition, the median survival of the all patients was 13 months following diagnosis. There was a significant impact of higher Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (≥80) on overall survival, p-log-rank test = 0.0002, whereas other parameters did not show any significant differences. The molecular analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 3/34 (8.82 %) cases; R273H, R306X, and Q136X. However, none of the analyzed samples contained the R132-IDH1 or R172-IDH2 mutations. These results showed the absence of IDH1 mutation in primary glioblastoma, confirming that this mutation is a hallmark of secondary glioblastoma. It can be used to distinguish primary from secondary glioblastomas. We found also that higher KPS was a significantly favorable factor in patients with primary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22865003
"""Differentiation of metastases from high-grade gliomas using short echo time 1H spectroscopy.""","""Purpose: To determine if short echo time (TE) (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can distinguish between intracranial metastases and glioblastomas. Materials and methods: TE 30-msec spectra were acquired (1.5 T) from voxels entirely within tumors from 23 glioblastoma patients and 24 metastases patients (3 breast carcinomas, 1 bladder carcinoma, 8 lung carcinomas, 3 probable lung carcinomas, 6 melanomas, 1 stomach carcinoma, and 2 undetermined). Spectra were analyzed quantitatively (LCModel) to determine metabolite, lipid, and macromolecule concentrations. All tumors were previously untreated and classified histopathologically. Results: The lipid peak area (LPA) ratio (total peak area at ca. delta1.3 to that at ca. delta0.9) was 2.6 +/- 0.6 (N = 25) for glioblastomas and 3.8 +/- 1.4 (N = 34) for metastases (P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in metabolite or lipid concentrations between the tumor groups. The LPA ratio provided 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity for discriminating metastases from glioblastomas. Conclusion: Lipid and macromolecule (LM) signals can dominate (1)H spectra of high-grade tumors and have characteristics that allow significant discrimination of metastases from glioblastomas. Work is now needed to determine the source and biophysical characteristics of these LM signals to further improve differentiation by optimizing the data acquisition and analysis protocol.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15269942
"""An extent of resection threshold for newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Object: The value of extent of resection (EOR) in improving survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains controversial. Specifically, it is unclear what proportion of contrast-enhancing tumor must be resected for a survival advantage and how much survival improves beyond this threshold. The authors attempt to define these values for the patient with newly diagnosed GBM in the modern neurosurgical era. Methods: The authors identified 500 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with supratentorial GBM treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1997 and 2009. Clinical, radiographic, and outcome parameters were measured for each case, including MR imaging-based volumetric tumor analysis. Results: The patients had a median age of 60 years and presented with a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The mean clinical follow-up period was 15.3 months, and no patient was unaccounted for. All patients underwent resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The median postoperative tumor volume was 2.3 cm(3), equating to a 96% EOR. The median overall survival was 12.2 months. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, age, KPS score, and EOR were predictive of survival (p < 0.0001). A significant survival advantage was seen with as little as 78% EOR, and stepwise improvement in survival was evident even in the 95%-100% EOR range. A recursive partitioning analysis validated these findings and provided additional risk stratification parameters related to age, EOR, and tumor burden. Conclusions: For patients with newly diagnosed GBMs, aggressive EOR equates to improvement in overall survival, even at the highest levels of resection. Interestingly, subtotal resections as low as 78% also correspond to a survival benefit.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21417701
"""Correlation Between Tumor Location and Clinical Properties of Glioblastomas in Frontal and Temporal Lobes.""","""Background: Tumor location is a major prognostic factor in glioblastomas and may be associated with clinical properties. This study established and analyzed the correlation between tumor location and clinical properties of glioblastomas in frontal and temporal lobes. Methods: This retrospective study determined the location of glioblastomas in the frontal lobe (FL) or temporal lobe (TL) based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, radiologic, and molecular characteristics of FL and TL glioblastomas were compared to define their clinical properties, including sex, age, sides, relationship to ventricle, imaging subtypes, volume, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: The study enrolled 406 patients (182 [44.83%] in FL group and 224 [55.17%] in TL group) with a mean age of 69.8 years. Compared with FL group, TL group had higher incidence of female patients (P = 0.024), tumor location distant to the ventricle (P = 0.006), isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (P = 0.021), promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (P = 0.012), and prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to age ≥60 years at study entry (P = 0.668), sides (P = 0.879), imaging subtypes (P = 0.362), or volume (P = 0.709). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that different tumor locations are associated with diverse clinical properties of glioblastomas in FL and TL.

"""Glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component - common origin of the different histological parts and genetic subclassification.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and most malignant brain tumors in adults. A small subgroup of glioblastomas contains areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation (GBMO). Our objective was to genetically characterize the oligodendroglial and the astrocytic parts of GBMOs and correlate morphologic and genetic features with clinical data. Methods: The oligodendroglial and the 'classic' glioblastoma parts of 13 GBMO were analyzed separately by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin sections using a custom probe set (regions 1p, 1q, 7q, 10q, 17p, 19q, cen18, 21q) and by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of microdissected paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Results: We identified four distinct genetic subtypes in 13 GBMOs: an 'astrocytic' subtype (9/13) characterized by +7/-10; an 'oligodendroglial' subtype with -1p/-19q (1/13); an 'intermediate' subtype showing +7/-1p (1/13), and an 'other' subtype having none of the former aberrations typical for gliomas (2/13). The different histological tumor parts of GBMO revealed common genetic changes in all tumors and showed additional aberrations specific for each part. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the monoclonal origin of GBMO followed by the development of the astrocytic and oligodendroglial components. The diagnostic determination of the genetic signatures may allow for a better prognostication of the patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20966543
"""Complementary but distinct roles for MRI and 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET in the assessment of human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a primary brain tumor known for its rapid proliferation, diffuse invasion, and prominent neovasculature and necrosis. This study explores the in vivo link between these characteristics and hypoxia by comparing the relative spatial geometry of developing vasculature inferred from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1Gd), edematous tumor extent revealed on T2-weighted MRI (T2), and hypoxia assessed by 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET (18F-FMISO). Given the role of hypoxia in upregulating angiogenic factors, we hypothesized that the distribution of hypoxia seen on 18F-FMISO is correlated spatially and quantitatively with the amount of leaky neovasculature seen on T1Gd. Methods: A total of 24 patients with glioblastoma underwent T1Gd, T2, and 18F-FMISO-11 studies preceded surgical resection or biopsy, 7 followed surgery and preceded radiation therapy, and 11 followed radiation therapy. Abnormal regions seen on the MRI scan were segmented, including the necrotic center (T0), the region of abnormal blood-brain barrier associated with disrupted vasculature (T1Gd), and infiltrating tumor cells and edema (T2). The 18F-FMISO images were scaled to the blood 18F-FMISO activity to create tumor-to-blood ratio (T/B) images. The hypoxic volume (HV) was defined as the region with T/Bs greater than 1.2, and the maximum T/B (T/Bmax) was determined by the voxel with the greatest T/B value. Results: The HV generally occupied a region straddling the outer edge of the T1Gd abnormality and into the T2. A significant correlation between HV and the volume of the T1Gd abnormality that relied on the existence of a large outlier was observed. However, there was consistent correlation between surface areas of all MRI-defined regions and the surface area of the HV. The T/Bmax, typically located within the T1Gd region, was independent of the MRI-defined tumor size. Univariate survival analysis found the most significant predictors of survival to be HV, surface area of HV, surface area of T1Gd, and T/Bmax. Conclusion: Hypoxia may drive the peripheral growth of glioblastomas. This conclusion supports the spatial link between the volumes and surface areas of the hypoxic and MRI regions; the magnitude of hypoxia, T/Bmax, remains independent of size.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19091885
"""Diagnostic utility of diffusion tensor imaging in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.""","""Background and purpose: Differentiation of glioblastomas and solitary brain metastases is an important clinical problem because the treatment strategy can differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential added value of DTI metrics in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases. Materials and methods: One hundred twenty-eight patients with glioblastomas and 93 with brain metastases were retrospectively identified. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values were measured from the enhancing and peritumoral regions of the tumor. Two experienced neuroradiologists independently rated all cases by using conventional MR imaging and DTI. The diagnostic performances of the 2 raters and a DTI-based model were assessed individually and combined. Results: The fractional anisotropy values from the enhancing region of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases (P < .01). There was no difference in mean diffusivity between the 2 tumor types. A classification model based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions differentiated glioblastomas from brain metastases with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, close to those obtained by 2 neuroradiologists using routine clinical images and DTI parameter maps (area under the curve = 0.90 and 0.85). The areas under the curve of the 2 radiologists were further improved to 0.96 and 0.93 by the addition of the DTI classification model. Conclusions: Classification models based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions of the tumor can improve diagnostic performance in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24503556
"""Extent of MGMT promoter methylation correlates with outcome in glioblastomas given temozolomide and radiotherapy.""","""Background: Epigenetic silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) by promoter methylation is associated with improved survival in glioblastomas treated with alkylating agents. In this study, we investigated MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy in a single UK treatment centre. Methods: Quantitative methylation data at individual CpG sites were obtained by pyrosequencing for 109 glioblastomas. Results: Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months with 2-year survival of 17.9%. Pyrosequencing data were reproducible with archival samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. Variation in methylation patterns of discrete CpG sites and intratumoral methylation heterogeneity were observed. A total of 58 out of 109 glioblastomas showed average methylation >non-neoplastic brain in at least one clinical sample; 86% had homogeneous methylation status in multiple samples. Methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Cases with methylation more than 35% had the longest survival (median PFS 19.2; OS 26.2 months, 2-year survival of 59.7%). Significant differences in PFS were seen between those with intermediate or high methylation and unmethylated cases, whereas cases with low, intermediate or high methylation all showed significantly different OS. Conclusions: These data indicate that MGMT methylation is prognostically significant in glioblastomas given chemoradiotherapy in the routine clinic; furthermore, the extent of methylation may be used to provide additional prognostic stratification.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19536096
"""Dual-modality optical biopsy of glioblastomas multiforme with diffuse reflectance and fluorescence: ex vivo retrieval of optical properties.""","""Glioma itself accounts for 80% of all malignant primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) accounts for 55% of such tumors. Diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy have the potential to discriminate healthy tissues from abnormal tissues and therefore are promising noninvasive methods for improving the accuracy of brain tissue resection. Optical properties were retrieved using an experimentally evaluated inverse solution. On average, the scattering coefficient is 2.4 times higher in GBM than in low grade glioma (LGG), and the absorption coefficient is 48% higher. In addition, the ratio of fluorescence to diffuse reflectance at the emission peak of 460 nm is 2.6 times higher for LGG while reflectance at 650 nm is 2.7 times higher for GBM. The results reported also show that the combination of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy could achieve sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90% in discriminating GBM from LGG during ex vivo measurements of 22 sites from seven glioma specimens. Therefore, the current technique might be a promising tool for aiding neurosurgeons in determining the extent of surgical resection of glioma and, thus, improving intraoperative tumor identification for guiding surgical intervention.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28157245
"""AKT activation in human glioblastomas enhances proliferation via TSC2 and S6 kinase signaling.""","""Aberrant AKT (protein kinase B) signaling is common in many cancers, including glioblastoma. Current models suggest that AKT acts directly, or indirectly via the TSC complex, to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as the main downstream mediator of AKT signaling. mTOR activation results in subsequent activation of S6K and STAT3, as well as suppression (i.e., phosphorylation) of 4E-BP1, leading to cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. Most studies of this pathway have used in vitro systems or tumor lysate-based approaches. We aimed to delineate these pathways in a primarily in situ manner using immunohistochemistry in a panel of 29 glioblastomas, emphasizing the histologic distribution of molecular changes. Within individual tumors, increased expression levels of p-TSC2, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-S6K, p-S6, and p-STAT3 were found in regions defined by elevated AKT activation. However, only TSC2, S6K, and S6 activation levels correlated significantly with AKT activation and clustered together in multidimensional scaling analyses. Ki-67 proliferation indices were significantly elevated in p-AKT-overexpressing regions, whereas expression of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 was generally low and not significantly different between the regions. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for a close correlation between AKT and TSC2 phosphorylation levels in glioblastoma. Moreover, they suggest that downstream p-AKT effects are primarily mediated by S6 kinase signaling, thus enhancing proliferation rather than inhibiting apoptosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16740698
"""Prognostic Value of Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced and Diffusion-Weighted MR Imaging in Patients with Glioblastomas.""","""Background and purpose: Prediction of survival in patients with glioblastomas is important for individualized treatment planning. This study aimed to assess the prognostic utility of presurgical dynamic susceptibility contrast and diffusion-weighted imaging for overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. Materials and methods: MR imaging data from pathologically proved glioblastomas between June 2006 to December 2013 in 58 patients (mean age, 62.7 years; age range, 22-89 years) were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into long survival (≥15 months) and short survival (<15 months) groups, depending on overall survival time. Patients underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion and DWI before surgery and were treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The maximum relative cerebral blood volume and minimum mean diffusivity values were measured from the enhancing part of the tumor. Results: Maximum relative cerebral blood volume values in patients with short survival were significantly higher compared with those who demonstrated long survival (P < .05). No significant difference was observed in the minimum mean diffusivity between short and long survivors. Receiver operator curve analysis demonstrated that a maximum relative cerebral blood volume cutoff value of 5.79 differentiated patients with low and high survival with an area under the curve of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.90 (P < .001), while a minimum mean diffusivity cutoff value of 8.35 × 10(-4)mm(2)/s had an area under the curve of 0.55, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.47 (P > .05) in separating the 2 groups.

Eighteen cases were categorized as untreated (n = 6), in remission after surgery and radiation therapy (n = 2), or recurrent (n = 10). Findings from MR images generally correlated well with the histologic extent of untreated tumors in white matter; the heterogeneous appearance of glioblastomas multiforme distinguished them from less malignant gliomas. Subpial spread and tumor in the subarachnoid space were not visualized. The extent of tumors in remission was overestimated on MR images because of the extensive surrounding edema and radiation necrosis. MR imaging findings correlated well with those from 48% of brain slices, but resulted in overestimations (24%) or underestimations (28%) of tumor extent in the ten cases of recurrent tumor.

However, the surgical indications, at present, are far from uniform and the concept of operability is extremely surgeon-dependant. The results of glioblastoma resection in 104 patients operated on between March 2005 and April 2011 were reviewed with the aim to shed some light on the limits between 'sins of action' (operating upon complex tumors causing a permanent severe deficit) and 'sins of non-action' (considering inoperable tumors that can be resected with good results). Fifty-five patients (54.4 %) (Group 1) presented with a 'disputable' surgical indication because of one or more of the following clinico-radiological aspects: involvement of motor and language areas (39.4 %), deep location (7.7 %), corpus callosum infiltration (13.4 %), or major vessels encasement (8.6 %). Forty-six (42.5 %) patients (Group 2) presented with an 'indisputable' surgical indication (readily accessible tumors in non-eloquent areas). Overall mortality was 2.9 %. The mean overall survival was 19.8 months and not significantly different in the two Groups (20.4 Group 2 and 19.5 months for Group 1; p = 0.7).

In this study, we screened 34 primary (de novo) glioblastomas and 16 secondary glioblastomas that had progressed from low-grade diffuse astrocytomas for alterations of the p14ARF and p16INK4a genes, including homozygous deletion by differential PCR, promoter hypermethylation by methylation-specific PCR, and protein expression by immunohistochemistry. A total of 29 glioblastomas (58%) had a p14ARF homozygous deletion or methylation, and 17 (34%) showed p16INK4a homozygous deletion or methylation. Thirteen glioblastomas showed both p14ARF and p16INK4a homozygous deletion, while nine showed only a p14ARF deletion. Immunohistochemistry revealed loss of p14ARF expression in the majority of glioblastomas (38/50, 76%), and this correlated with the gene status, i.e. homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation. There was no significant difference in the overall frequency of p14ARF and p16INK4a alterations between primary and secondary glioblastomas. The analysis of multiple biopsies from the same patients revealed hypermethylation of p14ARF (5/15 cases) and p16INK4a (1/15 cases) already at the stage of low-grade diffuse astrocytoma but consistent absence of homozygous deletions. These results suggest that aberrant p14ARF expression due to homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation is associated with the evolution of both primary and secondary glioblastomas, and that p14ARF promoter methylation is an early event in subset of astrocytomas that undergo malignant progression to secondary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11303791

Using published facts on primary glioblastomas, with special reference to cancer stem cells and their recently described heterogeneity, a hypothesis is being proposed that speculates the possible role of therapy mediated neoplastic cell loss in promoting the process of relapse in these tumors. The mechanisms by which such a phenomenon could be functional has been integrated into a double version theoretical model, which envisages glioblastomas as neoplasms comprising of multiple, differentially regulated and dynamically distinct neoplastic compartments (named as active and back-up compartments in this article) supported by their own complement of cancer stem cells, wherein therapy mediated cell loss, which mainly affects the size of the active compartment, results in abrogating the inhibitory effect of the active compartment on the back-up compartment, thereby leading to the activation of the back-up compartment. This activation contributes towards tumor recurrence. The possibility of the existence of such a phenomenon could have strong implications on management and prognosis of these tumors.

Primary glioblastomas are characterized by EGFR and MDM2 amplification/overexpression, PTEN mutations, and p16 deletions, whereas secondary glioblastomas frequently contain p53 mutations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 (LOH#10) is the most frequent genetic alteration in glioblastomas; the involvement of tumor suppressor genes, other than PTEN, has been suggested.

While histologically typical, one brainstem tumor showed mainly pleomorphic astrocytic cells, whereas the other brainstem and spinal tumors showed a GFAP positive small cell component. Whole chromosomal gains (#1 and #2) and loss (#20) were seen only in the pleomorphic brainstem GBM, which also showed a high level of segmental genomic copy number changes. Segmental loss involving chromosome 8 was seen in all three tumors (Chr8;133039446-136869494, Chr8;pter-3581577, and Chr8;pter-30480019 respectively), whereas loss involving chromosome 16 was seen in only 2 cases with small cell components (Chr16;31827239-qter and Chr16;pter-29754532). Segmental gain of chromosome 7 was shared only between the 2 brainstem cases (Chr7;17187166-qter and Chr7;69824947-qter). Chromosome 17 showed segmental gain of 17q in the backdrop of loss of 17p only in case 1. Segmental gain of chromosome 1q was seen only in case 2. The spinal GBM showed a relatively stable karyotype with a unique loss of Chr19;32848902-qter. None of the frequent losses, gains and amplifications known to occur in adult GBM were identified, suggesting that pediatric infratentorial glioblastomas show a molecular karyotype that was more characteristic of pediatric embryonal tumors than adult GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20621092
"""[Oligodendroglial and neuronal component in glioblastomas: possible relation with prognosis].""","""Glioblastomas are high grade astrocytic tumors and current histology criteria does not explain the longer survival in some cases. Presence of oligodendroglial component has been suggested as possible marker for better outcome by the international WHO Working Group of experts and by the proponents of the Sainte-Anne Hospital Classification (2000). The latter also states that a neuronal component is associated with better survival. The aim of this study was to analyze a series of 40 patients with tumors classified as glioblastomas based on the WHO criteria, in order to identify: the presence of an oligodendroglial component, using morphologic criteria; the presence of a neuronal component, using immunohistochemical markers (antibodies anti-neurofilament and synaptofisin). The histological and immunohistochemical findings were correlated with patients' survival and other variables of possible prognostic significance were also studied. Oligodendroglial component was identified in 11 cases and neuronal component in 7. Despite the small number of patients studied, this review detected a longer survival in patients with oligodendroglial component. The significance of expression of neuronal markers in malignant gliomas is still to be confirmed, with the evaluation of larger series.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15608972
"""Automated differentiation of glioblastomas from intracranial metastases using 3T MR spectroscopic and perfusion data.""","""Purpose: Differentiation of glioblastomas from metastases is clinical important, but may be difficult even for expert observers. To investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms in the differentiation of glioblastomas multiforme (GB) from metastases, we developed and tested a pattern recognition system based on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) data. Materials and methods: Single and multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were performed on 49 patients with solitary brain tumors (35 glioblastoma multiforme and 14 metastases). Metabolic (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, (Lip [Formula: see text] Lac)/Cr) and perfusion (rCBV) parameters were measured in both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. The statistical significance of these parameters was evaluated. For the classification procedure, three datasets were created to find the optimum combination of parameters that provides maximum differentiation. Three machine learning methods were utilized: Naïve-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbor (KNN). The discrimination ability of each classifier was evaluated with quantitative performance metrics. Results: Glioblastoma and metastases were differentiable only in the peritumoral region of these lesions ([Formula: see text]). SVM achieved the highest overall performance (accuracy 98%) for both the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Naïve-Bayes and KNN presented greater variations in performance. The proper selection of datasets plays a very significant role as they are closely correlated to the underlying pathophysiology. Conclusion: The application of pattern recognition techniques using 3T MR-based perfusion and metabolic features may provide incremental diagnostic value in the differentiation of common intraaxial brain tumors, such as glioblastoma versus metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23334798

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 141 patients, from a prospectively collected database from 2004-2014, with grade IV glioblastomas who underwent craniotomy and excision. Sixty-five patients were included in our analysis. Twenty patients underwent re-do craniotomy at recurrence and were compared with 45 patients who received nonsurgical therapy for recurrences. Primary end point was overall survival from time of diagnosis. Demographic and disease factors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis for significance. Results: The median survival for those with re-do craniotomy was 25.4 months compared with 11.6 months (P < 0.001) in the group that underwent nonsurgical therapy. The mean age for this group was 53.5 years. This group had a higher postsurgical/treatment median Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) of 80 compared with 60 (P < 0.001) showing better functional outcome. A Cox regression analysis of factors determined that age, KPS at recurrence, extent of resection at initial surgery and re-do craniotomy were significant for positive outcomes. Conclusion: Our results show that in a select group of patients with recurrent grade IV glioblastomas, repeated excision, aiming for gross total resection where safely possible, has significant survival benefit without severely compromising functionality and should be considered.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26585720

Proliferation indexes of PCNA, anti-Ki6 and AgNORs showed high values in the multiform glioblastoma p53 positive group, but without statistical differences in comparison with the group of p53-negative glioblastomas. Significant differences were observed in survival time of patients with p53 positive tumours in comparison with p53-negative ones. In 15 patients with p53-positive multiform glioblastomas survival time was less than 6 months (62.5%) on the contrary with only 4 patients with similar survival time in p53-negative glioblastoma group (23.5%).

Most glioblastoma cell lines are, in contrast to glioblastomas in vivo, relatively radiosensitive. This limits the value of using cell lines for studying the radiation effect of glioblastomas. The advantage of OMS is maintenance of the characteristics of the original tumour, which is lost in conventional cell cultures. OMS prepared from four glioblastomas were treated with hypofractionated radiation with a radiobiologically equivalent dose to standard radiation treatment for glioblastoma patients. After treatment, the histology as well as the cell proliferation of the OMS was examined. After radiation, a significant decrease in cell proliferation was found, although no histological damage to the OMS was observed. The modest effects of radiation on the OMS are in agreement with the limited therapeutic value of radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients. Therefore, OMS seems to be a good alternative for cell lines to study the radiobiological effect on glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9274449

Glioblastomas frequently show genetic alterations in the TP53 pathway. In the present study, we assessed MDM2 SNP309 in 360 glioblastomas, and correlated these with patient age and survival, as well as other alterations in the TP53 pathway. Frequencies of the MDM2 SNP309 T/T, T/G and G/G genotypes in glioblastomas were 40%, 46% and 14%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that MDM2 SNP309 G/G allele was significantly associated with favorable outcome in female glioblastoma patients (hazard ratio 0.54; 95% CI = 0.32-0.92).

"""The role of cerebral blood flow gradient in peritumoral edema for differentiation of glioblastomas from solitary metastatic lesions.""","""Objective: Differentiation of glioblastomas from solitary brain metastases using conventional MRI remains an important unsolved problem. In this study, we introduced the conception of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) gradient in peritumoral edema-the difference in CBF values from the proximity of the enhancing tumor to the normal-appearing white matter, and investigated the contribution of perfusion metrics on the discrimination of glioblastoma from a metastatic lesion. Materials and methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients with glioblastoma or a solitary metastatic lesion underwent three-dimensional arterial spin labeling (3D-ASL) before surgical resection. The CBF values were measured in the peritumoral edema (near: G1; Intermediate: G2; Far: G3). The CBF gradient was calculated as the subtractions CBFG1 -CBFG3, CBFG1 - CBFG2 and CBFG2 - CBFG3. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to seek for the best cutoff value permitting discrimination between these two tumors. Results: The absolute/related CBF values and the CBF gradient in the peritumoral regions of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those in metastases(P < 0.038). ROC curve analysis reveals, a cutoff value of 1.92 ml/100g for the CBF gradient of CBFG1 -CBFG3 generated the best combination of sensitivity (92.86%) and specificity (100.00%) for distinguishing between a glioblastoma and metastasis.

At present, no chemotherapy has appeared to influence its prognosis. On the other hand, recent advances in brain tumor biology have suggested that brain tumor growth is at least in part under a neuroendocrine control, mainly realized by opioid peptides and pineal substances. On this basis, we evaluated the influence of a concomitant administration of the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) in patients with glioblastoma treated with radical or adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). The study included 30 patients with glioblastoma, who were randomized to receive RT alone (60 Gy) or RT plus MLT (20 mg/daily orally) until disease progression. Both the survival curve and the percent of survival at 1 year were significantly higher in patients treated with RT plus MLT than in those receiving RT alone (6/14 vs. 1/16). Moreover, RT or steroid therapy-related toxicities were lower in patients concomitantly treated with MLT. This preliminary study suggests that a radioneuroendocrine approach with RT plus the pineal hormone MLT may prolong the survival time and improve the quality of life of patients affected by glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8570130

Materials and methods: Twenty-four patients with recurrent glioblastoma were examined using both ASL and C-met-PET before and 4 and 8 weeks after starting BEV treatment. Tumor-to-normal brain (T/N) ratios, fluctuations in T/N ratio, and tumor volumes were compared between ASL and C-met-PET. Accuracy of predicting patient with long progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed for T/N ratios and fluctuations for ASL and C-met-PET in each phase and in each period using receiver operating characteristic curves. Between 2 groups of patients assigned by cutoff values from receiver operating characteristic curves, PFS was compared in each phase or in each period. Results: T/N ratios, fluctuations in ratio, and tumor volumes correlated significantly between ASL and C-met-PET at all time points and all periods. Arterial spin labeling was eligible as a predictor for long PFS only in assessment of fluctuations in T/N ratio. However, the most accurate predictors for long PFS were T/N ratio from C-met-PET at 8 weeks and the fluctuation from baseline to 4 weeks in T/N ratio from C-met-PET. Conclusions: Blood flows on ASL correlated with accumulations of C-met on PET in recurrent glioblastoma under BEV treatment. Although C-met-PET offered superior accuracy for predicting patients with long PFS from time points, ASL offered reliable prediction of long PFS, provided that fluctuations in T/N ratio between consecutive scans are assessed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30562194
"""True progression versus pseudoprogression in the treatment of glioblastomas: a comparison study of normalized cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient by histogram analysis.""","""Objective: The purpose of this study was to differentiate true progression from pseudoprogression of glioblastomas treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ) by using histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) maps. Materials and methods: Twenty patients with histopathologically proven glioblastoma who had received CCRT with TMZ underwent perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 0, 1000 sec/mm(2)). The corresponding nCBV and ADC maps for the newly visible, entirely enhancing lesions were calculated after the completion of CCRT with TMZ. Two observers independently measured the histogram parameters of the nCBV and ADC maps. The histogram parameters between the true progression group (n = 10) and the pseudoprogression group (n = 10) were compared by use of an unpaired Student's t test and subsequent multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine the best predictors for the differential diagnosis between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to determine the best cutoff values for the histogram parameters that proved to be significant predictors for differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine the level of inter-observer reliability for the histogram parameters. Results: The 5th percentile value (C5) of the cumulative ADC histograms was a significant predictor for the differential diagnosis between true progression and pseudoprogression (p = 0.044 for observer 1; p = 0.011 for observer 2). Optimal cutoff values of 892 × 10(-6) mm(2)/sec for observer 1 and 907 × 10(-6) mm(2)/sec for observer 2 could help differentiate between the two groups with a sensitivity of 90% and 80%, respectively, a specificity of 90% and 80%, respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.880 and 0.840, respectively. There was no other significant differentiating parameter on the nCBV histograms. Inter-observer reliability was excellent or good for all histogram parameters (intraclass correlation coefficient range: 0.70-0.99). Conclusion: The C5 of the cumulative ADC histogram can be a promising parameter for the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression of newly visible, entirely enhancing lesions after CCRT with TMZ for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23901325
"""Transcriptome analysis of glioma cells for the dynamic response to gamma-irradiation and dual regulation of apoptosis genes: a new insight into radiotherapy for glioblastomas.""","""Ionizing radiation (IR) is of clinical importance for glioblastoma therapy; however, the recurrence of glioma characterized by radiation resistance remains a therapeutic challenge. Research on irradiation-induced transcription in glioblastomas can contribute to the understanding of radioresistance mechanisms. In this study, by using the total mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we assayed the global gene expression in a human glioma cell line U251 MG at various time points after exposure to a growth arrest dose of γ-rays. We identified 1656 genes with obvious changes at the transcriptional level in response to irradiation, and these genes were dynamically enriched in various biological processes or pathways, including cell cycle arrest, DNA replication, DNA repair and apoptosis. Interestingly, the results showed that cell death was not induced even many proapoptotic molecules, including death receptor 5 (DR5) and caspases were activated after radiation. The RNA-seq data analysis further revealed that both proapoptosis and antiapoptosis genes were affected by irradiation. Namely, most proapoptosis genes were early continually responsive, whereas antiapoptosis genes were responsive at later stages. Moreover, HMGB1, HMGB2 and TOP2A involved in the positive regulation of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis showed early continual downregulation due to irradiation. Furthermore, targeting of the TRAIL/DR5 pathway after irradiation led to significant apoptotic cell death, accompanied by the recovered gene expression of HMGB1, HMGB2 and TOP2A. Taken together, these results revealed that inactivation of proapoptotic signaling molecules in the nucleus and late activation of antiapoptotic genes may contribute to the radioresistance of gliomas. Overall, this study provided novel insights into not only the underlying mechanisms of radioresistance in glioblastomas but also the screening of multiple targets for radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24176853
"""Objective assessment of intraoperative tumor fluorescence reveals biological heterogeneity within glioblastomas: a biometric study.""","""Purpose: Heterogeneity within GBMs and variability of visualized fluorescence combine to confer practical limitations to the technique of optical imaging. A biometric analysis was planned to objectively ascertain and analyse this phenomenon METHODS: 25 adult glioblastoma subjects undergoing resection were prospectively accrued. Biopsies were taken from various parts of the tumor and safe peritumoral zones. White light (WL) and visualized fluorescence was subjectively recorded. Corresponding histopathology [coalescent (C) or infiltrating (I) tumor] and protoporphyrin-IX (PPIX) levels were assayed. Results: WL was very sensitive for detecting tumor. SF was more specific and had high positive predictive value for detecting tumor. WF on the other hand had a poor discriminatory efficacy. Mean PPIX levels were 3.0, 2.01 and 0.16 for SF, WF, and NF respectively. WF had a wide variable range of PPIX levels. Within the coalescent tumor areas, there was a variable distribution of fluorescence (both subjective as well as objective PPIX levels) with only 54% samples showing SF and high PPIX. In seven cases this discordance was noted within the same tumor (biological heterogeneity). Conclusions: Fluorescence may miss important tumor areas even if objective assessment is used.

"""Integrated morphologic analysis for the identification and characterization of disease subtypes.""","""Background and objective: Morphologic variations of disease are often linked to underlying molecular events and patient outcome, suggesting that quantitative morphometric analysis may provide further insight into disease mechanisms. In this paper a methodology for the subclassification of disease is developed using image analysis techniques. Morphologic signatures that represent patient-specific tumor morphology are derived from the analysis of hundreds of millions of cells in digitized whole slide images. Clustering these signatures aggregates tumors into groups with cohesive morphologic characteristics. This methodology is demonstrated with an analysis of glioblastoma, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify a prognostically significant morphology-driven subclassification, in which clusters are correlated with transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic events. Materials and methods: Methodology was applied to 162 glioblastomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify morphology-driven clusters and their clinical and molecular correlates. Signatures of patient-specific tumor morphology were generated from analysis of 200 million cells in 462 whole slide images. Morphology-driven clusters were interrogated for associations with patient outcome, response to therapy, molecular classifications, and genetic alterations. An additional layer of deep, genome-wide analysis identified characteristic transcriptional, epigenetic, and copy number variation events. Results and discussion: Analysis of glioblastoma identified three prognostically significant patient clusters (median survival 15.3, 10.7, and 13.0 months, log rank p=1.4e-3). Clustering results were validated in a separate dataset. Clusters were characterized by molecular events in nuclear compartment signaling including developmental and cell cycle checkpoint pathways.

The prognostic role of EGFRvIII in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients and changes in EGFRvIII expression in recurrent versus primary glioblastomas remain controversial, but such data are highly relevant for EGFRvIII-targeted therapies.Experimental Design:EGFR-amplified glioblastomas from 106 patients were assessed for EGFRvIII positivity. Changes in EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII status from primary to recurrent glioblastomas were evaluated in 40 patients with EGFR-amplified tumors and 33 patients with EGFR-nonamplified tumors. EGFR single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were assessed in 27 patients. Data were correlated with outcome and validated in 150 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium.Results: Sixty of 106 EGFR-amplified glioblastomas were EGFRvIII-positive (56.6%). EGFRvIII positivity was not associated with different progression-free or overall survival. EGFRvIII status was unchanged at recurrence in 35 of 40 patients with EGFR-amplified primary tumors (87.5%). Four patients lost and one patient gained EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. None of 33 EGFR-nonamplified glioblastomas acquired EGFR amplification or EGFRvIII at recurrence. EGFR SNVs were frequent in EGFR-amplified tumors, but were not linked to survival.Conclusions: EGFRvIII and EGFR SNVs are not prognostic in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients. EGFR amplification is retained in recurrent glioblastomas. Most EGFRvIII-positive glioblastomas maintain EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. However, EGFRvIII expression may change in a subset of patients at recurrence, thus repeated biopsy with reassessment of EGFRvIII status is recommended for patients with recurrent glioblastoma to receive EGFRvIII-targeting agents.

"""Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 as a putative regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated resistance to O6-alkylating agents in human glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: Pre-existing and acquired drug resistance are major obstacles to the successful treatment of glioblastomas. Methods: We used an integrated resistance model and genomics tools to globally explore molecular factors and cellular pathways mediating resistance to O6-alkylating agents in glioblastoma cells. Results: We identified a transcriptomic signature that predicts a common in vitro and in vivo resistance phenotype to these agents, a proportion of which is imprinted recurrently by gene dosage changes in the resistant glioblastoma genome. This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and survival. Modularity was a predominant organizational principle of the signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping networks. A highly significant network was built around nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which included the persistent alterations of various NF-kappaB pathway elements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) was identified as a new regulatory component of a putative cytoplasmic signaling cascade that mediates NF-kappaB activation in response to DNA damage caused by O6-alkylating agents. Expression of the corresponding zinc finger protein A20 closely mirrored the expression of the TNFAIP3 transcript, and was inversely related to NF-kappaB activation status in the resistant cells. A prediction model based on the resistance signature enabled the subclassification of an independent, validation cohort of 31 glioblastomas into two outcome groups (P = .037) and revealed TNFAIP3 as part of an optimized four-gene predictor associated significantly with patient survival (P = .022). Conclusion: Our results offer strong evidence for TNFAIP3 as a key regulator of the cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-kappaB en route to O6-alkylating agent resistance in glioblastoma cells.

We investigated 18 sGBMs, including 8 sGBMs with IDH1/2 mutations (sGBM-Mut) and 10 with wild-type IDH1/2 (sGBM-Wt). The median overall survival time of patients with sGBM-Mut was significantly longer than that of patients with sGBM-Wt (68.2 vs. 25.3 months). The median time from initial diagnosis to sGBM diagnosis was also significantly longer for sGBM-Mut than for sGBM-Wt (50.1 vs. 13.4 months).

Genetic heterogeneity between pGBM and sGBM has been documented as have differences in the methylation of individual genes. A hypermethylator phenotype in grade IV GBMs is now well documented however there has been little comparison between global methylation profiles of pGBM and sGBM samples or of methylation profiles between paired early and late sGBM samples. Methods: We performed genome-wide methylation profiling of 20 matched pairs of early and late gliomas using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips to assess methylation at >485,000 cytosine positions within the human genome. Results: Clustering of our data demonstrated a frequent hypermethylator phenotype that associated with IDH1 mutation in sGBM tumors. In 80% of cases, the hypermethylator status was retained in both the early and late tumor of the same patient, indicating limited alterations to genome-wide methylation during progression and that the CIMP phenotype is an early event. Analysis of hypermethylated loci identified 218 genes frequently methylated across grade II, III and IV tumors indicating a possible role in sGBM tumorigenesis. Comparison of our sGBM data with TCGA pGBM data indicate that IDH1 mutated GBM samples have very similar hypermethylator phenotypes, however the methylation profiles of the majority of samples with WT IDH1 that do not demonstrate a hypermethylator phenotype cluster separately from sGBM samples, indicating underlying differences in methylation profiles. We also identified 180 genes that were methylated only in sGBM. Further analysis of these genes may lead to a better understanding of the pathology of sGBM vs pGBM.

"""Towards a Computer Aided Prognosis for Brain Glioblastomas Tumor Growth Estimation.""","""Bridging the gap between mathematical and biological models and clinical applications could be considered as one of the new challenges of medical image analysis over the ten last years. This paper presents an advanced and convivial algorithm for brain glioblastomas tumor growth modelization. The brain glioblastomas tumor region would be extracted using a fast distribution matching developed algorithm based on global pixel wise information. A new model to simulate the tumor growth based on two major elements: cellular automata and fast marching method (CFMM) has been developed and used to estimate the brain tumor evolution during the time. On the basis of this model, experiments were carried out on twenty pathological MRI selected cases that were carefully discussed with the clinical part. The obtained simulated results were validated with ground truth references (real tumor growth measure) using dice metric parameter. As carefully discussed with the clinical partner, experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm for brain glioblastomas tumor growth model proved a good agreement. Our main purpose behind this research was of course to make advances and progress during clinical explorations helping therefore radiologists in their diagnosis. Clinical decisions and guidelines would be hence so more focused with such an advanced tool that could help clinicians and ensuring more accuracy and objectivity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26441424
"""Positive influence of partial resection on overall survival of patients with overlapping glioblastomas.""","""Objectives: Patients with overlapping glioblastomas (former known as gliomatosis cerebri according to the 2007 WHO classification) have a poor prognosis. Most of the patients undergo biopsy to confirm histopathological diagnosis. Treatment comprises chemotherapy, radiation and combination of both. We determined whether resection of the contrast enhancing tumor parts leads to a prolonged survival. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis and included 31 patients with overlapping glioblastomas (OG) who showed WHO IV in the initial histopathological examination. All patients fulfilled criteria of overlapping glioblastomas in the MRI according to WHO criteria (3 or more lobes were affected). We evaluated Karnofsky performance score (KPS), gender, age, IDH-1_R132H status, MGMT promotor methylation status, proliferation index, postoperative therapy, biopsy vs. partial resection and extent of resection as possible factors affecting overall survival (OAS). A matched pair analysis was performed between the biopsy and resection group on basis of age, KPS and combined radio-chemotherapy. Results: 10 Patients underwent resection of the contrast enhancing tumor parts, 21 patients underwent stereotactic biopsy. All included patients showed contrast enhancing lesions in the MRI. Median age was 61 years in the biopsy-group and 53 in the partial resection (PR) group. We found a significant correlation between OAS and age <50 (p=0.02). Median KPS was 80 in the STX group vs. 100 in the PR group. KPS above 80 was significantly associated with longer OAS (p=0.02). Median survival was 174days in the STX group compared to 446days in the PR group (p=0.05). Also the matched pair analysis showed significant p-values for resection. Conclusion: Partial resection might have a positive impact on overall survival of patients with overlapping glioblastomas (former known as gliomatosis cerebri), although the prognosis remains limited.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837843
"""Robust discrimination of glioblastomas from metastatic brain tumors on the basis of single-voxel (1)H MRS.""","""This article investigates methods for the accurate and robust differentiation of metastases from glioblastomas on the basis of single-voxel (1)H MRS information. Single-voxel (1)H MR spectra from a total of 109 patients (78 glioblastomas and 31 metastases) from the multicenter, international INTERPRET database, plus a test set of 40 patients (30 glioblastomas and 10 metastases) from three different centers in the Barcelona (Spain) metropolitan area, were analyzed using a robust method for feature (spectral frequency) selection coupled with a linear-in-the-parameters single-layer perceptron classifier. For the test set, a parsimonious selection of five frequencies yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, and an area under the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Moreover, these accurate results for the discrimination between glioblastomas and metastases were obtained using a small number of frequencies that are amenable to metabolic interpretation, which should ease their use as diagnostic markers. Importantly, the prediction can be expressed as a simple formula based on a linear combination of these frequencies. As a result, new cases could be straightforwardly predicted by integrating this formula into a computer-based medical decision support system. This work also shows that the combination of spectra acquired at different TEs (short TE, 20-32 ms; long TE, 135-144 ms) is key to the successful discrimination between glioblastomas and metastases from single-voxel (1)H MRS.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22081447
"""MGMT promoter hypermethylation in a series of 104 glioblastomas.""","""Aim: To evaluate MGMT promoter hypermethylation as prognostic factor in a retrospective study of 104 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials and methods: The O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical samples. Results: The MGMT gene was found to be methylated in 29 of 101 tumors (28.7%) by MSP, according to the evaluation methods employed. By immunohistochemistry, different categories were identified on the basis of reaction intensity, percentage of positive cells and homogeneous or heterogeneous distribution. MSP did not correlate with immunohistochemistry, with the exception of the category with the highest percentage of positive cells and homogeneity of immunostaining. Western blotting analysis correlated with immunohistochemical findings (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.268, p=0.0211), but not with MSP. By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, radiotherapy was a significant prognostic factor (p=0.0001). When uncensored patients alone were considered, MGMT methylation status showed a significant correlation with survival (p=0.026). Temozolomide therapy correlated with survival (p=0.022), but not with MGMT methylation. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, only radiotherapy remained as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0001).

"""Emerging role of linker histone variant H1x as a biomarker with prognostic value in astrocytic gliomas. A multivariate analysis including trimethylation of H3K9 and H4K20.""","""Although epigenetic alterations play an essential role in gliomagenesis, the relevance of aberrant histone modifications and the respective enzymes has not been clarified. Experimental data implicates histone H3 lysine (K) methyltransferases SETDB1 and SUV39H1 into glioma pathobiology, whereas linker histone variant H1.0 and H4K20me3 reportedly affect prognosis. We investigated the expression of H3K9me3 and its methyltransferases along with H4K20me3 and H1x in 101 astrocytic tumors with regard to clinicopathological characteristics and survival. The effect of SUV39H1 inhibition by chaetocin on the proliferation, colony formation and migration of T98G cells was also examined. SETDB1 and cytoplasmic SUV39H1 levels increased from normal brain through low-grade to high-grade tumors, nuclear SUV39H1 correlating inversely with grade. H3K9me3 immunoreactivity was higher in normal brain showing no association with grade, whereas H1x and H4K20me3 expression was higher in grade 2 than in normal brain or high grades. These expression patterns of H1x, H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 were verified by Western immunoblotting. Chaetocin treatment significantly reduced proliferation, clonogenic potential and migratory ability of T98G cells. H1x was an independent favorable prognosticator in glioblastomas, this effect being validated in an independent set of 66 patients. Diminished nuclear SUV39H1 expression adversely affected survival in univariate analysis. In conclusion, H4K20me3 and H3K9 methyltransferases are differentially implicated in astroglial tumor progression. Deregulation of H1x emerges as a prognostic biomarker.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602259
"""Glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component-common origin of the different histological parts and genetic subclassification.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and most malignant brain tumors in adults. A small subgroup of glioblastomas contains areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation (GBMO). Our objective was to genetically characterize the oligodendroglial and the astrocytic parts of GBMOs and correlate morphologic and genetic features with clinical data. Methods: The oligodendroglial and the 'classic' glioblastoma parts of 13 GBMO were analyzed separately by interphase fluoreszence in situ hybridization (FISH) on paraffin sections using a custom probe set (regions 1p, 1q, 7q, 10q, 17p, 19q, cen18, 21q) and by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of microdissected paraffin embedded tumor tissue. Results: We identified four distinct genetic subtypes in 13 GBMOs: an 'astrocytic' subtype (9/13) characterized by +7/-10; an 'oligodendroglial' subtype with -1p/-19q (1/13); an 'intermediate' subtype showing +7/-1p (1/13), and an 'other' subtype having none of the former aberrations typical for gliomas (2/13). The different histological tumor parts of GBMO revealed common genetic changes in all tumors and showed additional aberrations specific for each part. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the monoclonal origin of GBMO followed by the development of the astrocytic and oligodendroglial components.

"""Evaluation of Peritumoral Brain Parenchyma Using Contrast-Enhanced 3D Fast Imaging Employing Steady-State Acquisition at 3T for Differentiating Metastatic Brain Tumors and Glioblastomas.""","""Background: Metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas are the 2 of the most common brain neoplasms in adults. However, distinguishing solitary metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas on conventional magnetic resonance imaging remains particularly challenging. Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (CE-FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing between metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients with metastatic brain tumors and 14 patients with glioblastomas underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CE-FIESTA before surgery. First, 1 neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon classified the CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma by consensus. Next, the 2 neuroradiologists performed an observer performance study comparing tumor shape classification (smooth or irregular margins), a classic imaging finding, with the CE-FIESTA classification of the peritumoral brain parenchyma. Results: The CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma were classified as follows: type A, no hyperintense rim; type B, partial hyperintense rim; and type C, extended hyperintense rim. With regard to the diagnosis of metastatic brain tumors, the observer performance study demonstrated that the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of an extended hyperintense rim classification (type C) on CE-FIESTA images were 95.3%, 85.7%, and 93.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the CE-FIESTA classification was significantly higher than that of the tumor shape classification. Conclusions: CE-FIESTA images may provide useful information for distinguishing metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas, especially when focusing on differences in the peritumoral brain parenchyma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165229

Subjects and methods: Sixty-eight patients with glioblastoma were studied prospectively with CT and MR. The first postoperative scan was obtained between day 1 and day 5; follow-up scans were obtained bimonthly. Results: Residual tumor was shown most reliably on scans obtained shortly after surgery (MR, 77%; CT, 40.5%). After the fourth day up to 3 months postoperatively, surgically induced enhancement prevented recognition of residual tumor. Seventy-five percent of patients with residual tumor shown by early postoperative MR had progressive disease during follow-up, whereas only 36% of patients without evidence of residual tumor had MR signs of progressive disease. Conclusion: Early, enhanced, postoperative MR is the radiologic procedure of choice to determine the extent of glioblastoma resection.

"""Frequent LOH on 22q12.3 and TIMP-3 inactivation occur in the progression to secondary glioblastomas.""","""Frequent allelic losses on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q) in gliomas indicate the presence of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) at this location. However, the target gene(s) residing in this chromosome are still unknown and their putative roles in the development of astrocytic tumors, especially in secondary glioblastoma, have not yet been defined. To compile a precise physical map for the region of common deletions in astrocytic tumors, we performed a high-density loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using 31 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning 22q in a series of grade II diffuse astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, primary glioblastomas, and secondary glioblastomas that had evolved from lower grade astrocytomas. LOH was found at one or more loci in 33% (12/36) of grade II diffuse astrocytomas, in 40% (4/10) of anaplastic astrocytomas, in 41% (26/64) of primary glioblastomas, and in 82% (23/28) of secondary glioblastomas. Characterization of the 22q deletions in primary glioblastomas identified two sites of minimally deleted regions at 22q12.3-13.2 and 22q13.31. Interestingly, 22 of 23 secondary glioblastomas affected shared a deletion in the same small (957 kb) region of 22q12.3, a region in which the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) is located. Investigation of the promoter methylation and expression of this gene indicated that frequent hypermethylation correlated with loss of TIMP-3 expression in secondary glioblastoma. This epigenetic change was significantly correlated to poor survival in eight patients with grade II diffuse astrocytoma. Our results suggest that a 957 kb locus, located at 22q12.3, may contain the putative TSG, TIMP-3, that appears to be relevant to progression to secondary glioblastoma and subsequently to the prognosis of grade II diffuse astrocytoma. In addition, the possibility of other putative TSGs on 22q12.3-13.2 and 22q13.31 that may also be involved in the development of primary glioblastomas cannot be ruled out.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592495
"""Frequent HRK inactivation associated with low apoptotic index in secondary glioblastomas.""","""To detect and identify the genetic alterations and methylation status of the HRK gene in human glioblastomas, we analyzed a cohort of astrocytic tumors for hypermethylation, loss of heterozygosity on 12q13.1, and gene expression. Our study examined a series of 36 diffuse low-grade astrocytomas, 32 anaplastic astrocytomas, 64 primary glioblastomas, and 28 secondary glioblastomas that had evolved from either 24 low-grade diffuse astrocytomas or 4 anaplastic astrocytomas. The region around the HRK transcription start site was methylated in 19% of diffuse astrocytomas, in 22% of anaplastic astrocytomas, in 27% of primary glioblastomas, and in 43% of secondary glioblastomas. HRK expression was significantly reduced in 61% of secondary glioblastomas as compared to other types of tumors, and aberrant methylation was closely associated with loss of expression. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis also demonstrated a clear agreement between reduced HRK protein levels and low or absent HRK transcripts. Lack of HRK immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with a low apoptotic index, whereas a strong association between methylation status and apoptosis was found only in secondary glioblastomas. Abnormal methylation of HRK was detected in astrocytic tumors concurrent with methylation of multiple genes, including p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). Interestingly, these epigenetic changes in secondary glioblastoma were further associated with wild-type p53. Our findings suggest that HRK is inactivated mainly by aberrant DNA methylation in astrocytic tumors and that reduced HRK expression contributes to the loss of apoptotic control in high-grade tumors. Reduced expression of HRK may serve as one important molecular mechanism in progression to secondary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16155764
"""Chromosome 17 allelic loss in astrocytic tumors and its clinico-pathologic implications.""","""To prognosticate the implications of various allelic losses on chromosome 17 in the morphology and biology of astrocytic tumors, we have examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 14 microsatellite loci on chromosome 17 in a series of 19 astrocytic tumors (3 astrocytomas, 5 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 11 glioblastomas). The DNA samples extracted from tumor and matched normal brain tissue were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and photography under UV transillumination. The molecular genetic data were compared with immunohistochemistry performed with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), MIB-1 and p53 protein. LOH was observed in 11/19 (58%) instances with frequent involvement of TP53, NF1, and D17S795 loci, LOH at D17S578 and D17S520 occurred in recurrent tumors exclusively. Allelic status of D17S795 in all 12 informative instances were concordant with GFAP immunoreactivity (p < 0.01, Fisher's test). p53 immunopositivity (> 25% of tumor cell nuclei) was seen in 11 (58%) tumors, of which 6 were informative of TP53 locus with 2 (33%) demonstrating LOH. The MIB-1 staining indexes in astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were 1.9 +/- 0.9, 8.4 +/- 4.0, and 17.1 +/- 7.1% (mean +/- SD), respectively, and their differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05, Student's t test).

Clinical characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Median age was 59 years; 52 % were female; median preoperative Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 80. Twelve patients underwent biopsy and eleven underwent surgical decompression. The median tumor volume for the biopsy group was 60.6 cm(3) and for the surgically decompressed group 40.5 cm(3). In the biopsy group, five patients received adjuvant therapy but one died prior to its completion; two died prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy and five were lost to follow up. In the surgical decompression group, seven patients received adjuvant therapy, one died prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy, two were treated with palliative measures only, and one was lost to follow up. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall median post surgical-survival of the whole group was 180 days, the biopsy group 48 days, and the surgically decompressed group 265 days (p = 0.14). Our results show that there was a higher median survival in the surgically decompressed group; but a direct correlation could not be established, and that the median KPS did not improve in either group after treatment.

In this study, the prototypic Ki67 antibody and several new Ki67 equivalent antibodies were tested on human glioblastoma tissue. Methods: Eleven glioblastomas were included in the study. The antibodies used were the prototypic monoclonal Ki67 and the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies MIB1 (monoclonal), NC-MM1 (monoclonal), NC-Ki67p (polyclonal), and rabbit antihuman Ki67 antigen (polyclonal). The prototypic Ki67 was used on frozen sections and the other Ki67 antibodies on microwave oven heated, formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded sections. Results: All antibodies exhibited specific granular nuclear staining of weak to strong intensity. In some tumours the labelling indices were within the same range, whereas in others the antibodies elicited divergent values. Conclusions: All the novel Ki67 equivalent antibodies provided satisfactory staining on paraffin sections. However, a significant spread of labelling indices was recorded in some cases.

We have investigated the expression of microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2), synaptophysin and non-phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament protein (NFP) by immunohistochemistry in 15 low grade diffuse astrocytomas and 15 glioblastomas. MAP-2 was strongly expressed in 97% of cases, using an antibody to both low and high molecular weight isoforms. An antibody specific to high molecular weight isoforms of MAP-2 (hmw-MAP-2) revealed weaker, focal staining in 60% of cases with greater expression in the glioblastomas (P=0.027). NFP was expressed in 50% of cases, but was generally weak and focal. There was little evidence of synaptophysin expression. We conclude that MAP-2 expression in astrocytomas is due predominantly to low molecular weight isoforms, which may be expressed in astrocytes as well as neurons. Focal expression of hmw-MAP-2 and NFP, however, suggest that neuronal antigens may be expressed, particularly in high grade astrocytomas.

Methods: A data base that included 430 patients with glioblastomas and 916 patients with brain metastases who underwent radiotherapy at the author's hospital between 1980 and 2000 was analyzed. Patterns of care were compared for different age groups using the chi-square test. Results: In both patient groups, age turned out to be an independent risk factor. Older age was associated with worse overall survival. Independent of the cut-off age (< 50 years vs. > or = 50 years, < 60 years vs. > or = 60 years, < 65 years vs. > or = 65 years, and < 70 years vs. > or = 70 years), there were no statistically significant differences between the age groups concerning the use of different imaging modalities (computed tomography scans vs. magnetic resonance imaging), type of surgery (none vs. biopsy vs. resection), waiting time for radiotherapy (< median vs. > or = median), radiotherapy treatment planning (simulator-based vs. computer-based), use of radiation sources (cobalt unit vs. linear accelerator), and fractionation protocols (conventional vs. modified). When the recruitment period of 21 years was divided into 3 intervals, impressive changes with regard to the patterns of care became apparent. However, the changes were seen similarly throughout the different age groups. Conclusions: Older age did not limit access to state-of-the-art patterns of care in neurooncology.

"""Association of elevated glial expression of interleukin-1beta with improved survival in patients with glioblastomas multiforme.""","""Object: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression with improved survival in patients with glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs). Immune and vascular host-tumor interactions play a pivotal role in the control of tumor development, and inflammatory mechanisms may participate in the host's defense against tumor cells. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been noted in various types of malignant tumors, raising the possibility that endogenous expression of cytokines and the resulting cytotoxic action of sustained NO production play a role in the control of tumor growth. Indeed, human GBMs express variable amounts of iNOS. Methods: In this study, the expression of iNOS and of cytokines known to upregulate IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma or downregulate iNOS transcription (IL-10, transforming growth factor [TGF]beta1, and TGFbeta2) were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with competitor DNA in 39 samples of human GBM. The iNOS level in GBM was positively correlated with IL-1beta messenger (m)RNA, but not with the other cytokines tested. Immunocytochemical double labeling revealed that both anti-iNOS immunoreactivity and anti-IL-1beta immunoreactivity colocalized with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in GBM. Some macrophage/microglial cells also expressed iNOS, but not IL-1beta. Comparison of biological data with clinical parameters indicated that the survival duration was enhanced when levels of IL-1beta mRNA were elevated or when levels of TGFbeta2 were low, but was independent of the level of iNOS mRNA within the tumor. Conclusions: Taken together, these data indicate that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta produced within GBM by glial-derived cells has a negative impact on tumor growth through a mechanism independent of iNOS induction.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11838804
"""Velocity of radial expansion of contrast-enhancing gliomas and the effectiveness of radiotherapy in individual patients: a proof of principle.""","""Aims: The initial aims were to use recently available observations of glioblastomas (as part of a previous study) that had been imaged twice without intervening treatment before receiving radiotherapy in order to obtain quantitative measures of glioma growth and invasion according to a new bio-mathematical model. The results were so interesting as to raise the question whether the degree of radio-sensitivity of each tumour could be estimated by comparing the model-predicted and actual durations of survival and total numbers of glioma cells after radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging volumes were segmented and used to calculate the velocity of radial expansion (v) and the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion/dispersal (D) for each patient according to the bio-mathematical model. Results: The ranges of the values of v, D and rho show that glioblastomas, although clustering at the high end of rates, vary widely one from the other. The effects of X-ray therapy varied from patient to patient. About half survived as predicted without treatment, indicating radio-resistance of these tumours. The other half survived up to about twice as long as predicted without treatment and could have had a corresponding loss of glioma cells, indicating some degree of radio-sensitivity. These results approach the historical estimates that radiotherapy can double survival of the average patient with a glioblastoma. Conclusions: These cases are among the first for which values of v, D and rho have been calculated for glioblastomas. The results constitute a 'proof of principle' by combining our bio-mathematical model for glioma growth and invasion with pre-treatment imaging observations to provide a new tool showing that individual glioblastomas may be identified as having been radio-resistant or radio-sensitive.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18308523
"""Diversity and frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in human glioblastomas.""","""Several types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been reported in glioblastomas, and in nearly all cases the alterations have been reported in tumors with EGFR amplification. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency and diversity of EGFR mutations in glioblastomas and to determine whether gene mutation is inevitably associated with increased EGFR gene dosage. To accomplish these aims, we sequenced cDNA products representing the entire EGFR coding region in 44 glioblastomas, half of which had EGFR amplification. Coding sequence alterations were identified in 17 of the tumors, and each of these cases had amplified EGFR. No mutations were identified in the 22 tumors without EGFR amplification. An additional 26 glioblastomas with EGFR amplification were then examined to establish more reliable frequencies for each type of mutation identified in the tumors for which the entire gene was sequenced. Transcripts associated with the most common mutation lacked coding sequence for amino acids 6-273 (67%). This mutation has been described extensively in the literature. Transcripts encoding receptors that would truncate at amino acid 958 and transcripts encoding receptors that would lack amino acids 521-603 were the next most common types of alteration. Each of these were observed in 15% of the tumors with EGFR amplification. Other mutations were observed at lower frequencies, but among these were three cases with missense mutations. Sixteen of the 48 tumors with EGFR amplification showed multiple types of EGFR mutations (33%), and in one case it was determined that multiple alterations had occurred in the same transcript. In total, these data are consistent with EGFR mutation being exclusively and frequently associated with EGFR amplification. Furthermore, the determination of multiple EGFR mutations within individual tumors suggests that glioblastomas with EGFR amplification have the capacity to produce a variety of functionally distinct EGFRs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10728703

In particular, several phase I studies have been performed using DC pulsed by GBM proteins as a vaccine for patients with relapsing GBM. The studies demonstrated that DC vaccination is safe and may produce a significant increase in overall survival. As the first step in the preparation of appropriate conditions for a clinical evaluation in Italy, we have performed pre-clinical experiments on immune-competent mice injected intra-cerebrally with syngeneic GL261GBM cells and treated subcutaneously and intra-tumorally with DC loaded with a GL261 homogenate. These results show that vaccination with DC pulsed with a tumor lysate increases considerably survival in mice bearing intracranial glioblastomas and supports the development of DC-based clinical trials for patients with glioblastomas that do not respond to standard therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16808884

Materials and methods: Twenty-two patients (11 male, 11 female; 27 tumors) with histologically confirmed glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) were examined with conventional MR imaging and DSC imaging at 3T before surgery or biopsy. Then nCBV (means and standard deviations) in each mass was measured using two DSC MR perfusion analysis methods including manual and semiautomatic segmentation method, in which contrast-enhanced (CE)-T1WI and T2WI were used as structural imaging. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility were assessed according to each perfusion analysis method or each structural imaging. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plot, and coefficient of variation (CV) were used to evaluate reproducibility. Results: Intraobserver reproducibilities on CE-T1WI and T2WI were ICC of 0.74-0.89 and CV of 20.39-36.83% in manual segmentation method, and ICC of 0.95-0.99 and CV of 8.53-16.19% in semiautomatic segmentation method, repectively. Interobserver reproducibilites on CE-T1WI and T2WI were ICC of 0.86-0.94 and CV of 19.67-35.15% in manual segmentation method, and ICC of 0.74-1.0 and CV of 5.48-49.38% in semiautomatic segmentation method, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed a good correlation with ICC or CV in each method. The semiautomatic segmentation method showed higher intraobserver and interobserver reproducibilities at CE-T1WI-based study than other methods.

"""Influence of an oligodendroglial component on the survival of patients with anaplastic astrocytomas: a report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02.""","""Purpose: Seven percent of patients with high grade gliomas enrolled in RTOG 83-02 had mixed astrocytoma/oligodenroglial elements on central pathology review. It has often been assumed that the most aggressive histologic component of a tumor determines biologic behavior; however in this trial, the survival of patients who had mixed glioblastomas/oligodenrogliomas was significantly longer than that of patients with pure glioblastomas (GBM). We therefore evaluated the effect of an oligodendroglial component on the survival of patients who had anaplastic astrocytomas (AAF) treated in the same trial. Methods and materials: One hundred nine patients who had AAF and 24 patients with mixed AAF/oligodendrogliomas (AAF/OL) were enrolled in a Phase I/II trial of randomized dose-escalation hyperfractioned radiotherapy plus BCNU. AAF/OL patients were older and more likely to have had more aggressive surgery than AAF patients. Other pretreatment characteristics were balanced between groups, as was assigned treatment. Results: The median survival time for AAF was 3.0 years versus 7.3 years for AAF/OL (p = 0.019). In a multivariate analysis, adjusting for extent of surgical resection and age, an oligodendroglial component was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusion: The results support the concept that AAFs with an oligodendroglial component have a better prognosis than pure AAF tumors, similar to the effect seen among patients with glioblastoma multiforme tumors. This better survival outcome should be taken into consideration in the design and stratification of future trials. Additionally, in contrast to patients with GBMs, patients who have AAF/OL have the potential for prolonged survival; therefore, late sequelae of treatment (both radiation and chemotherapy) must be weighed more heavily in the benefits to risks analysis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9276354

We recently reported that mutations of the p53 gene are present in more than two-thirds of secondary glioblastomas but rarely occur in primary glioblastomas, suggesting the presence of different genetic pathways (Watanabe et al, Brain Pathol 1996:6:217-24). In the present study, primary and secondary glioblastomas were screened by immunohistochemistry for MDM2 overexpression and by differential PCR for gene amplification. Tumor cells immunoreactive to MDM2 were found in 15 of 29 primary glioblastomas (52%), but in only 3 of 27 secondary glioblastomas (11%; P=0.0015). MDM2 amplification occurred in 2 primary (7%) glioblastomas but in none of the secondary glioblastomas. Only one out of 15 primary glioblastomas overexpressing MDM2 contained a p53 mutation.

"""Role of MIB1 in predicting survival in patients with glioblastomas.""","""Background: Histologic immunomarkers of cell cycle proteins have been utilized for prognosis in high-grade astrocytic tumors. One such marker, MIB1, an antibody immunoreactive throughout the cell cycle, is predictive of more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in astrocytomas. An independent role of MIB1 analysis for survival prediction and clinical management within histologic grades has not been clearly proven. Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated MIB1 reactivity in tissue samples from 116 patients with glioblastomas on initial medical presentation. Clinical variables considered included gender, age, Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS), extent of surgical resection, adjuvant radiation and survival. Results: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to correlate these variables with MIB1 staining. MIB1 staining does not predict overall survival or response to adjuvant therapy as an independent risk factor. Conclusion: MIB1 labeling does not predict patient survival as an independent variable and does not predict response to additional therapies.

"""Quantitative telomerase expression in glioblastomas shows regional variation and down-regulation with therapy but no correlation with patient outcome.""","""Despite the nearly ubiquitous expression of telomerase in almost all types of malignant human tumors, studies have shown widely varying positivity in the highest-grade glioma, the glioblastomas (GBMs), ranging from 26% to 100% of tumors analyzed. We have previously shown significant variability in positive versus negative telomerase expression from region to region within the same GBM. In this study, we hypothesized that application of new quantitative methodology would extend our previous observations and identify whether there is heterogeneity in levels of protein expression even within areas positive for telomerase in high-grade gliomas. Finally, we sought to correlate quantitative telomerase expression with patient outcome and therapeutic response. Quantitative analysis was achieved by polymerase chain-based TRAP assay with phosphorimager analysis and compared with clinical information obtained from 19 patients, most with primary, untreated GBMs. Results showed up to 3-fold variability in telomerase levels across multiple regional samples from the same patient, as well as between patients. In 5 of 6 patients with recurrent tumors who had received intervening radiation therapy or chemotherapy, telomerase was downregulated in the second, post-therapy sample. These data provide in vivo corroboration of recent in vitro experiments showing telomerase downregulation after radiation therapy or chemotherapy treatment of cell lines. Our finding of variability in levels of telomerase expression in GBMs parallels the known heterogeneity of these tumors for histologic features and cell growth-related factors.

"""Heterogeneous activation of the TGFbeta pathway in glioblastomas identified by gene expression-based classification using TGFbeta-responsive genes.""","""Background: TGFbeta has emerged as an attractive target for the therapeutic intervention of glioblastomas. Aberrant TGFbeta overproduction in glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas has been reported, however, to date, none of these reports has systematically examined the components of TGFbeta signaling to gain a comprehensive view of TGFbeta activation in large cohorts of human glioma patients. Methods: TGFbeta activation in mammalian cells leads to a transcriptional program that typically affects 5-10% of the genes in the genome. To systematically examine the status of TGFbeta activation in high-grade glial tumors, we compiled a gene set of transcriptional response to TGFbeta stimulation from tissue culture and in vivo animal studies. These genes were used to examine the status of TGFbeta activation in high-grade gliomas including a large cohort of glioblastomas. Unsupervised and supervised classification analysis was performed in two independent, publicly available glioma microarray datasets. Results: Unsupervised and supervised classification using the TGFbeta-responsive gene list in two independent glial tumor gene expression data sets revealed various levels of TGFbeta activation in these tumors. Among glioblastomas, one of the most devastating human cancers, two subgroups were identified that showed distinct TGFbeta activation patterns as measured from transcriptional responses. Approximately 62% of glioblastoma samples analyzed showed strong TGFbeta activation, while the rest showed a weak TGFbeta transcriptional response. Conclusion: Our findings suggest heterogeneous TGFbeta activation in glioblastomas, which may cause potential differences in responses to anti-TGFbeta therapies in these two distinct subgroups of glioblastomas patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19192267

The authors therefore retrospectively characterized the clinical behavior and pathological features of these tumors. A review of the database at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada revealed four patients with cerebellar tumors that displayed significant pleomorphism, hypercellularity, mitoses, and necrosis with pseudopalisading. The authors performed a detailed clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors in these four children (three boys and one girl; average age at presentation 7 years; range 21 months-15 years). Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography most commonly revealed a large lesion with minimal edema, inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, and a discrete border. Tumor resection was subtotal in one patient and gross total in three patients. Immunostaining of the tumor cells with antisera to glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin was positive in varying degrees. Initial adjuvant therapy consisted of local radiation only (one patient), chemotherapy only (one patient), and radiation and chemotherapy (one patient). One patient received no adjuvant therapy. Tumor recurrence was documented in all patients: two local recurrences (at 3.5 and 7 months), one spinal recurrence (at 14 months), and one local recurrence with ventricular and spinal spread (at 8 months). Ultimately, three of the four patients developed leptomeningeal tumor spread. Patient follow up ranged from 8 to 17 months (mean 12.5 months). Three patients were dead at last follow up with a mean survival of 15 months.

Cluster C1 contained 37.47% of all GB and 41.09% of all polymorphic glioblastomas (PG). Cluster C2 included 35.06% of all GB and 44.96% of all giant cell glioblastomas (GCG).

Furthermore, it was of interest, whether correlations between spectroscopic data and histomorphology can be confirmed for proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei independently. Using stringent inclusion criteria for this study, 24 patients were investigated by means of preoperative 1HMRS and by means of digital image analysis of paraffin sections from the surgical specimen. Proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei were investigated separately in the region with the highest proliferative activity in each tumor using immunohistological staining for the proliferation marker Ki67. Main results showed highly significant correlations between total creatine and variables of nuclear size, as well as correlations between choline and variables of nuclear shape. These results were confirmed for both proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei. A significant correlation between N-acetyl-aspartate level and topometric variables (number of neighbors per nucleus, variables describing distances between tumor cell nuclei) was confirmed for proliferating tumor cell nuclei. Discriminant analysis provided a good separation of cases with high and with low values for these spectroscopic variables based on histomorphometric data.

Evidence suggests that the response of various tumors to radiotherapy may be influenced by the status of p53 which is involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. This study tests the hypothesis that p53 governs survival in patients (n = 62) with glioblastomas who have received radiotherapy. Analysis of TP53 and p53 immunohistochemistry were undertaken using standard methods. TP53 mutations were present in 27% tumors, while 50% were p53-immunopositive (LI > 3%).

Results: The ratios of rTBF to rCBF in the contralateral white matter, contralateral gray matter, and contralateral hemisphere of high-grade gliomas were higher than low-grade gliomas (all p < 0.05). ASL results in the solid tumors revealed that rCBF was greater in high-grade gliomas.

"""Immunohistochemical markers for prognosis of cerebral glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma is the commonest neuroectodermal tumor and the most malignant in the range of cerebral astrocytic gliomas. The prognostic utility of various biological markers for glioblastomas has been broadly tested but the results obtained are regarded as controversial. In the present study, 302 glioblastoma specimens were studied to evaluate a possible association between clinical outcome and expression of some immunohistochemical variables. Furthermore, tumors examined were subdivided on the three cytological subsets--small-cell (SGB), pleomorphic-cell (PGB) and gemistocytic (GGB). Immunohistochemical variables differed between various subsets: the number of p53-positive tumors was found to be prevailed among the PGB, whereas the number of tumors with EGFR and mdm2 positivity was significantly greater in SGB. GGB contained significantly lowest mean proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index (LI), greater number of p21ras positive cases, and higher mean apoptotic index (AI). Survival time in patients with SGB, EGFR and mdm2-positivity and PCNA LI >40% was found to be significantly shorter, whereas presence of p21ras and AI >0.5% were associated with prolonged survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that survival time is associated with SGB, EGFR-positivity, and AI (p = 0.0023, p = 0.0035 and p = 0.0029 respectively). We conclude that although some immunohistochemical variables were found to be significant for glioblastoma outcome, they appear to be closely related to biology of single cytological subsets. Furthermore, these variables exhibited no prognostic value when they were analyzed within each cytological subset separately. Therefore, the glioblastoma subdivision on three cytological subsets proposed by us is carrying some element of rationality but, undoubtedly, requires further prospective studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12187957
"""Immunohistochemical analysis of metallothionein in astrocytic tumors in relation to tumor grade, proliferative potential, and survival.""","""Background: Metallothionein (MT) is the name for a family of predominantly intracellular protein thiol compounds involved in anticancer drug resistance. For certain tumors, MT is related to grade of tumor malignancy and prognosis. The authors evaluated the expression of MT in 114 astrocytic tumors in relation to the proliferative potential of tumors and the survival of patients. Methods: Paraffin embedded tissue sections were stained with monoclonal anti-metallothionein and MIB-1 Ki-67 antibodies by avidin-biotin complex immunohistochemistry. Results: MT expression was observed in 2 of 6 pilocytic astrocytomas, in 10 of 24 Grade 2 astrocytomas, in 16 of 25 anaplastic astrocytomas, and in 47 of 59 glioblastomas. In addition to the tumor cells, microvascular endothelial proliferation and smooth muscle of tumor vessel walls were frequently MT positive. The glioblastomas had a significantly higher percentage of MT positive cells compared with low grade (P < 0.0001) and anaplastic (P < 0.04) astrocytomas. MT expression in astrocytomas had no correlation with tumor recurrence. The mean Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was significantly higher in the high grade (3-4) compared with the low grade (1-2) astrocytomas. MT positive astrocytic tumors had statistically significantly higher mean Ki-67 LI compared with MT negative tumors, irrespective of histologic grade. Although the levels of MT and Ki-67 LI varied in individual tumors, the mean Ki-67 LI increased in parallel to the increasing MT staining grade, and this difference attained statistical significance only for glioblastoma. MT positive anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma patients did not survive as long as the MT negative patients, although this difference attained statistical significance only for anaplastic astrocytoma. Conclusions: The current study suggests that MT might play a significant role in the growth of astrocytic tumors, with an acquired enhanced ability to produce MT as the malignant potential of a tumor increases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9840536
"""Quantitative investigation of nuclear morphology in glioblastomas and its relation to survival time.""","""Objective: To investigate the influence of nuclear morphology of tumor cells on survival time of patients with primary glioblastomas. Study design: Tumor cell nuclei have been measured in paraffin sections from 51 glioblastomas (Ki-67 immunostaining). In each tumor, the region with the highest proliferative activity has been selected for performing the morphometric analysis. Nuclear area, shape variables (roundness factor, Fourier amplitudes) and the proliferation index Ki-67 have been determined. Statistical relationships between these variables have been tested by principal component analysis and Spearman's correlation analysis. The survival time has been tested using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The influence of morphometric variables on survival time and on the time until recurrence has been tested by Cox analysis. Results: There is a significant correlation of mean value and standard deviation of nuclear area with shape variables. Cox analysis showed a significant influence of the quantitative morphologic variables on survival time for patients with and without complete surgical resection. For patients with complete surgical resection, there was a distinct influence of mean nuclear area on survival time. Patients with incomplete surgical resection of the tumors had a significantly shorter survival. No significant influence of the variables on the time from surgery to recurrence could be shown. Conclusion: Quantitative morphology of tumor cell nuclei in our set of glioblastoma cases showed a statistically significant relation with the survival time of the patients, indicating the biological significance of nuclear morphology in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12809355

The aim of our study was to compare these values and enhancement % in order to determine whether enhancement of glioblastomas depends mainly on their vascularisation or anaplastic grade. Materials and methods: Seventeen patients with brain glioblastomas were studied with perfusion, diffusion and T1-weighted Spin-Echo MR sequences, with and without contrast medium. The quantitative evaluations were made on solid tumour tissue regions of interest (ROI), and the high vascularisation (high rCBV) and low anaplastic grade (high ADC) ROI group was separated from the low vascularisation (low rCBV) and high anaplastic grade (low ADC) group. The mean enhancement % values of the two groups were compared by using statistical METHODS. Results: In 14 patients there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In one patient, the enhancement of high anaplastic grade and low vascularisation ROIs was significantly higher, whereas in two patients, the enhancement of high vascularisation and low anaplastic ROIs clearly prevailed. Conclusions: Given that the anaplastic grade is proportional to blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, our results show that, in most cases, enhancement of glioblastomas is equally dependent on vascularisation and BBB impairment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12386559

The expression of the PTEN protein in glioblastomas also shows great intratumour heterogeneity, but the significance of this heterogeneity has so far received little attention. Methods: We conducted a comparative study on paraffin and frozen samples from 60 glioblastomas. Based on PTEN immunostaining, paraffin glioblastomas were divided into positive (homogeneous staining) and both positive and negative (heterogeneous staining) tumours. DNA was extracted from manually microdissected samples from representative areas, and from frozen samples taken randomly from the same tumours. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 10q23 and hypermethylation status of the PTEN promoter were studied, and the molecular findings were correlated with overall survival. Results: PTEN protein was present heterogeneously in 42 cases and homogeneously in 18 cases. In homogeneous glioblastomas, no correlation was found between PTEN protein expression and the LOH of the gene. Surprisingly, in the heterogeneous glioblastomas, LOH was found significantly more frequently (P < 0.001) in PTEN-positive areas (81%) than in PTEN-negative ones (35.7%). In general, molecular results of frozen tissue were representative of the tumour. Only two cases of methylation of the PTEN promoter were identified. A significant difference was found for overall survival for LOH10q23 status (P = 0.005) and for homogeneous vs. heterogeneous tumours (P = 0.014). Conclusion: The expression of PTEN protein does not correlate with the abnormalities of the LOH of the gene.

We analyzed prognosis factors in patients with grade IV glioblastoma treated between 1993 and 1997. The 22 long-term survival patients (survival over 26 months) were extracted from our 30 years archives and the 2 populations are compared. The incidence was 2.6/100,000h/year, 62% male and 38% female, mean age 59 years, mean survival 12 months, median survival time 9 months. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, surgical treatment and radiotherapy were all dependent prognosis factors for better survival. Statistically, survival was best for total surgical removal of tumors, followed by tumor gross resection then biopsy. Clinical status and inextirpable tumor location were also prognosis factors. The free interval time between total surgery and tumor reappearance was strongly correlated with survival (r=0.94). This suggests that some grade IV gliomas follow a quicker course, others exhibiting slow growth. Each of the prognosis factors was confirmed in the long-survival patients. Prevalence of all glioblastomes was 4.3%. Their mean age was 42 and mean survival 62 months. A larger proportion of these patients had total surgery and radiotherapy. The time lapse before tumor reappearance was longer. Deep tumor locations were less frequent. The proportion of secondary versus primary glioblastomas was the greatest difference between the long-term and regular survivors. Secondary glioblastomas were found in only 4% of the standard population and in 23 to 41% in the long-term survivors (p<0.01). Primary glioblastomas typically show EGFR over expression and mutation (variant III). The pathway to secondary glioblastoma involves early P53 mutation.

The initial regimens were prescribed as adjuvant therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment. Newly diagnosed patients were treated with up to four cycles of this regimen (TNF-SAM2, MCNU, and radiotherapy: TMR group). Seventeen patients (11 men and 6 women) aged 24 to 68 years (median 54.6 years) were eligible and evaluated for response and toxicity. The estimated median survival time was 354 weeks with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 76 weeks with glioblastomas. One- and 2-year survival rates were 100% and 100% with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 69.2% and 29.7% with glioblastomas. Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities were not experienced. None of the patients experienced a treatment delay due to toxicity. All other acute toxicities were anticipated and manageable. Twenty three patients (11 men and 12 women) aged 22 to 66 years (median 50.7 years) were evaluated as a historical control of patients who received chemotherapy with MCNU alone in conjunction with radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment (MCNU and radiotherapy: MR group).

Patients underwent surgery, limited field external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy with temporary high-activity iodine 125 sources, giving an additional 50 Gy to the tumor bed. Results: Median survival for patients undergoing brachytherapy was 18 months compared with 11 months for a matched brachytherapy control group with similar clinical and radiologic features (P < 0.0007). Survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis of 83%, 34%, and 27%, respectively, for patients receiving brachytherapy were significantly increased compared with survival rates of 40%, 12.5%, and 9%, respectively, for control subjects.

The resistance of glioblastoma cells to the mono-alkylating agent temozolomide is determined to some extent by the activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). Methods: To monitor the effect of CUX1 and its CUT domains on APE1 activity, DNA repair assays were performed with purified proteins and cell extracts. CUX1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a tumor microarray of 150 glioblastoma samples. The effect of CUX1 knockdown and overexpression on the resistance of glioblastoma cell lines to temozolomide was investigated. Results: We show that CUT domains stimulate APE1 activity. In agreement with these findings, CUX1 knockdown causes an increase in the number of abasic sites in genomic DNA and a decrease in APE1 activity as measured in cell extracts. Conversely, ectopic CUX1 expression increases APE1 activity and lowers the number of abasic sites. Having established that CUX1 is expressed at high levels in most glioblastomas, we next show that the resistance of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide and to a combined treatment of temozolomide and ionizing radiation is reduced following CUX1 knockdown, but increased by overexpression of CUX1 or a short protein containing only 2 CUT domains, which is active in DNA repair but devoid of transcriptional activity.

Methods: We analyzed mean and maximum rCBV from the enhancing areas normalized to the contralateral white matter in 44 pretreated glioblastomas with MR-morphological tumor progression. The diagnosis (real progression vs. TRC) was determined by histopathology or by clinical/MRI-follow-up. We performed nonparametric tests, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Significant differences between tumor progression (N = 37) and TRC (N = 7) were found for rCBVmean (2.44 ± 1.05 vs. 1.69 ± .56, P < .03) and rCBVmax (3.40 ± 1.25 vs. 2.21 ± .62, P < .0007). A rCBVmax of 2.6 had 78% sensitivity and 86% specificity to detect tumor progression. Neither rCBVmean nor rCBVmax was predictive for the patient overall survival (OS). There were no statistically different rCBVmean and rCBVmax between the first and further tumor progressions. Conclusions: The rCBVmax differentiates tumor progression from TRC in unselected recurrent glioblastomas, but it is not predictive for the OS.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25907688
"""Gyriform infiltration as imaging biomarker for molecular glioblastomas.""","""Background: Molecular glioblastomas (i.e. without the histological but with the molecular characteristics of IDH-wild-type glioblastoma) frequently lack contrast enhancement, which can wrongly lead to suspect a lower-grade glioma. Herein, we aimed to assess the diagnostic value of gyriform infiltration as an imaging marker for molecular glioblastomas. Methods: Two independent investigators reviewed the MRI scans from patients with newly diagnosed gliomas for the presence of a gyriform infiltration defined as an elective cortical hypersignal on MRI FLAIR sequence. Diagnostic test performance of this sign for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma were calculated. Results: A total of 426 patients were included, corresponding to 31 molecular glioblastoma, 294 IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, 50 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and 51 IDH-mutant 1p19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma. A gyriform infiltration was observed in 16/31 (52%) molecular glioblastoma, 40/294 (14%) IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, and none of the IDH-mutant glioma. All the 56 gyriform-infiltration-positive tumors were IDH-wild-type and all but two had a TERT promoter mutation. The inter-rater agreement was good (κ = 0.69, p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the presence of a gyriform infiltration for the diagnosis of molecular glioblastoma were 52%, 90%, 29%, 96%, respectively. The median overall survival was better for gyriform-infiltration-negative patients compared to gyriform-infiltration-positive patients in the whole series and in patients with non-enhancing lesions (n = 95) (25.6 vs 16.9 months, p = 0.005 and 20.2 months vs not reached, p < 0.001).

Cytotoxic effect of desloratadine was investigated using MTT and CV assays, while oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy were detected by flow cytometry and immunoblot. Desloratadine treatment decreased cell viability of U251 human glioblastoma cell line and primary human glioblastoma cell culture (IC50 value 50 µM) by an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species and caspase activity. Also, desloratadine decreased the expression of main autophagy repressor mTOR and its upstream activator Akt and increased the expression of AMPK.

There were 28 MGMT-immunopositive and 25 negative glioblastomas. Patients with MGMT-immunonegative glioblastomas showed significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.0032), but no statistically significant benefits on overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0825) were shown.

"""Pediatric glioblastoma: clinico-radiological profile and factors affecting the outcome.""","""Background and purpose: Glioblastoma in the pediatric age group is relatively rare. As a result, it has been difficult to deduce any consistent clinico-radiological and pathological profiles on these patients. Also, the prognostic factors affecting the survival in pediatric glioblastoma are not as well defined as in adults. Patients and methods: In this retrospective series, 65 pediatric patients (age ≤ 18 years) from January 1995 to December 2011 with histopathologically proven diagnosis of intracranial glioblastoma were studied. Clinico-radiological, pathological, treatment, and follow-up data were collected. Progression-free and overall survivals were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The male-to-female ratio was 2.6:1 with a mean age of 13.29 ± 4.53 years (range 2-18 years). Headache with or without vomiting (n = 51, 78 %), followed by seizures (n = 42, 65 %), and focal deficits (n = 31, 47 %) were the leading symptoms. Forty-nine (75 %) patients had tumors located superficially, whereas there were 16 patients with deeply located glioblastomas (25 %). Gross total tumor excision was achieved in 43 (66 %) patients, while the remaining patients had incomplete excision (n = 22, 34 %). Mean follow-up was 17.7 months (range 1.5-119 months). The median progression-free and overall survivals were 10 and 20 months, respectively. Extent of resection was found to be the independent predictor of survival (p value = 0.002). Conclusion: Pediatric glioblastomas are associated with longer progression-free as well as overall survivals. Extent of tumor resection is the strongest predictor of survival in pediatric glioblastoma. Hence, an aggressive surgical resection may fetch a better outcome in children with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22903238
"""Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone cross the blood-brain barrier: a potential applicability to treatment of brain tumors.""","""Hypothalamic growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates the synthesis and release of GH from the pituitary gland. GHRH and its mRNA are also found in human cancers of the breast, ovary, prostate, lung, and other tumors, suggesting that GHRH is also a tumor growth factor. Various studies show that GHRH antagonists have antiproliferative effects in many tumor models; however, glioblastomas were examined only recently. Previous studies have demonstrated that s.c. administration of GHRH antagonist (JV-1-36) inhibited growth of s.c. U-87MG human glioblastomas and increased survival of nude mice with orthotopic implants of glioblastomas. Although treatment with JV-1-36 reduced tumorigenicity, it is not known whether peripherally administered GHRH antagonists can cross the blood-brain barrier. Brain endothelial cells joined by tight junctions form the blood-brain barrier, a 'barrier' between the general circulation and the CNS. In this study, we administered a GHRH antagonist (JV-1-42) and showed that, after i.v. injection, iodinated JV-1-42 (131I-JV-1-42) enters the brain intact at a rate of 0.8514 mocrol/g per min with a serum half-life of 12.2 min. A one-site binding hyperbolic model indicated that the maximal percent of i.v. dose taken up per gram of brain was 0.41%. Coinjection of unlabeled JV-1-42 indicated that the transport from blood to brain is not saturable; however, transport from brain to blood is saturable and involves P-glycoprotein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that i.v.-administered 131I-JV-1-42 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain. This finding indicates that GHRH antagonists could provide a potential treatment for malignant glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16118272
"""Promoter hypermethylation of the RB1 gene in glioblastomas.""","""Loss of expression of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) has been shown to occur in up to 25% of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV). To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we assessed RB1 promoter hypermethylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and RB1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 35 primary (de novo) glioblastomas and in 21 secondary glioblastomas that had progressed from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). Promoter hypermethylation was significantly more frequent in secondary (9 of 21, 43%) than in primary glioblastomas (5 of 35, 14%; p = 0.0258). There was a clear correlation between loss of RB1 expression and promoter hypermethylation. In the majority of glioblastomas with loss of RB1 expression, there was promoter hypermethylation (11 of 13, 85%), whereas 93% of tumors with RB1 expression had a normal RB1 gene status (p < 0.0001). In three glioblastomas, areas with and without RB1 expression were microdissected; promoter hypermethylation was detected only in areas lacking RB1 expression. In patients with multiple biopsies, methylation of the RB1 promoter was not detectable in the less malignant precursor lesions, ie, low-grade diffuse and anaplastic astrocytoma. These results indicate that promoter hypermethylation is a late event during astrocytoma progression and is the major mechanism underlying loss of RB1 expression in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11204276
"""Opposing roles of glutaminase isoforms in determining glioblastoma cell phenotype.""","""Glutamine (Gln) and glutamate (Glu) play pivotal roles in the malignant phenotype of brain tumors via multiple mechanisms. Glutaminase (GA, EC 3.5.1.2) metabolizes Gln to Glu and ammonia. Human GA isoforms are encoded by two genes: GLS gene codes for kidney-type isoforms, KGA and GAC, whereas GLS2 codes for liver-type isoforms, GAB and LGA. The expression pattern of both genes in different neoplastic cell lines and tissues implicated that the kidney-type isoforms are associated with cell proliferation, while the liver-type isoforms dominate in, and contribute to the phenotype of quiescent cells. GLS gene has been demonstrated to be regulated by oncogene c-Myc, whereas GLS2 gene was identified as a target gene of p53 tumor suppressor. In glioblastomas (GBM, WHO grade IV), the most aggressive brain tumors, high levels of GLS and only traces or lack of GLS2 transcripts were found. Ectopic overexpression of GLS2 in human glioblastoma T98G cells decreased their proliferation and migration and sensitized them to the alkylating agents often used in the chemotherapy of gliomas.

However, little is known about the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of GLTSCR2 as a tumour suppressor gene. We investigated the pathological significance of GLTSCR2 expression in association with the development and progression of glioblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumour. We used real-time PCR and western blot analysis to examine the expression levels of GLTSCR2 mRNA and protein in glioblastomas, normal brain tissue and in non-glial tumour tissue of different origin, and found that GLTSCR2 expression is down-regulated in glioblastomas. In addition, direct sequencing analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization clearly demonstrates the presence of genetic alterations, such as a nonsense mutation and deletion, in the GLTSCR2 gene in glioblastomas. Finally, our immunohistochemical study demonstrates that GLTSCR2 is sequentially down-regulated according to the histological malignant progression of the astrocytic glial tumour.

"""Role of micro-RNA (miRNA) in pathogenesis of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a very lethal form of human brain cancer, which is characterized by rapid diffuse, infiltrative growth and high level of cellular heterogeneity. Such cancer patients usually survive for one year under treatment. Recently, the role of small non-coding RNA known as microRNAs (miRNA), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, as miRNAs play a critical role in the tumor-forming processes. The change in expression levels of several miRNAs has been found in GBM patients within last 10 years. It is evident now that impairment of miRNA regulation is one of the key mechanisms in GBM pathogenesis. The miRNA deregulation is involved in many processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, invasion, glioma stem cell behavior, and angiogenesis. GBM is also known as Grade IV astrocytoma, a rare disease with an incidence of 2-3 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and North America, and 50% with GBM die within 1 year, while 90% within 3 years.

Invasive malignant glioma cells show a decrease in their proliferation rates and a relative resistance to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) but seem less resistant to autophagic cell death (type II programmed cell death). Autophagic cell death represents an alternative mechanism to overcome, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of glioblastomas to pro-apoptotic-related therapies. Another way to potentially overcome apoptosis resistance is to decrease the migration of malignant glioma cells in the brain, which then should restore a level of sensitivity to pro-apoptotic drugs.

"""Relationship between thallium-201 uptake by supratentorial glioblastomas and their morphological characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging.""","""Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with thallium-201 is used in the assessment of patients with gliomas because the amount of 201Tl accumulated by the tumoral cells increases in proportion to the degree of tumour malignancy, thus making it possible to differentiate high-grade from low-grade gliomas or recurrences from radiation necrosis. However, in large areas of tissue such as those examined in 201Tl SPET studies, the uptake of 201Tl may vary considerably even in tumours with the same histological diagnosis, as occurs in glioblastomas (GBMs). In order to evaluate the possible influence of the macroscopic characteristics of tumours on 201Tl uptake, we studied a series of 13 patients with histologically proven GBMs, comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters such as tumour dimensions, perilesional oedema, intratumoral necrosis and contrast enhancement with the degree of 201Tl uptake. The patients underwent both 201Tl SPET and MRI before surgery. The 201Tl index (tumour/contralateral unaffected brain) was calculated using two different region of interest (ROI) methods: the first employed irregular large ROIs (3.2+/-13.9 cm2) including pixels with more than 50% maximum activity; the second employed regular square small ROIs (2.7 cm2) centered on the maximum activity of the lesion. Of the MRI morphological parameters studied, only necrosis significantly reduced the degree of 201Tl uptake in GBMs when larger ROIs were used. However, by using small regular ROIs the influence of necrosis on 201Tl uptake was found to be less relevant. Since necrosis is related to tumour proliferative activity and represents a negative prognostic factor in astrocytoma, a possible underestimation of 201Tl uptake due to intratumoral necrosis must be carefully evaluated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698056

Tibolone (TIB) is a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator widely prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent bone lost. The effects of TIB on the growth of glioblastoma are unknown. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effects of TIB on cell number, migration, and invasion of two derived human glioblastoma cell lines (U251 MG and U87), as well as the role of this steroid in estrogen and progesterone receptors activity and content. Methods: U251-MG and U87 human glioblastoma cell lines were grown with different doses of TIB. The number of cells was determined and migration and invasion tests were carried out. Protein expression was performed by Western blot. Results: We observed that TIB (10 nM) increased the number of cells by inducing proliferation with no effects on cell migration or invasion. The increase in cell proliferation induced by TIB was blocked by estrogen (ERs) or progesterone receptor (PRs) antagonists, ICI 182, 780 and RU 486, suggesting that these receptors mediate proliferating actions of TIB; TIB also modified the content of ERs and PRs by increasing ER-α, ER-β, and PR-B, while decreased PR-A.

"""MGMT methylation status: the advent of stratified therapy in glioblastoma?""","""Glioblastomas are the most malignant gliomas with median survival times of only 15 months despite modern therapies. All standard treatments are palliative. Pathogenetic factors are diverse, hence, stratified treatment plans are warranted considering the molecular heterogeneity among these tumors. However, most patients are treated with 'one fits all' standard therapies, many of them with minor response and major toxicities. The integration of clinical and molecular information, now becoming available using new tools such as gene arrays, proteomics, and molecular imaging, will take us to an era where more targeted and effective treatments may be implemented. A first step towards the design of such therapies is the identification of relevant molecular mechanisms driving the aggressive biological behavior of glioblastoma. The accumulation of diverse aberrations in regulatory processes enables tumor cells to bypass the effects of most classical therapies available. Molecular alterations underlying such mechanisms comprise aberrations on the genetic level, such as point mutations of distinct genes, or amplifications and deletions, while others result from epigenetic modifications such as aberrant methylation of CpG islands in the regulatory sequence of genes. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene encoding a DNA repair enzyme was recently found to be of predictive value in a randomized clinical trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma testing the addition of the alkylating agent temozolomide to standard radiotherapy. Determination of the methylation status of the MGMT promoter may become the first molecular diagnostic tool to identify patients most likely to respond that will allow individually tailored therapy in glioblastoma. To date, the test for the MGMT-methylation status is the only tool available that may direct the choice for alkylating agents in glioblastoma patients, but many others may hopefully become part of an arsenal to stratify patients to respective targeted therapies within the next years.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17325429

However, the surrounding brain parenchyma was not stained by YM-1. On the other hand, podoplanin expression was not observed in diffuse astrocytoma (0/30: 0%). Furthermore, we investigated the expression of podoplanin using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in 54 frozen astrocytic tumors (6 diffuse astrocytomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 34 glioblastomas). Podoplanin mRNA and protein expression were markedly higher in glioblastomas than in anaplastic astrocytomas. These data suggest that podoplanin expression might be associated with malignancy of astrocytic tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16596424
"""The antitumorigenic response of neural precursors depends on subventricular proliferation and age.""","""Glioblastomas, the most aggressive primary brain tumors, occur almost exclusively in adult patients. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) are antitumorigenic in mice, as they can migrate to glioblastomas and induce tumor cell death. Here, we show that the antitumor effect of NPCs is age-dependently controlled by cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and that NPCs accumulating at a glioblastoma are diverted from their normal migratory path to the olfactory bulb. Experimentally induced cortical glioblastomas resulted in decreased subventricular proliferation in adult (postnatal day 90) but not in young (postnatal day 30) mice. Adult mice supplied fewer NPCs to glioblastomas and had larger tumors than young mice. Apart from the difference in proliferation, there was neither a change in cell number and death rate in the SVZ nor a change in angiogenesis and immune cell density in the tumors. The ability to kill glioblastomas was similar in NPCs isolated from young and adult mice. The proliferative response of NPCs to glioblastomas depended on the expression of D-type cyclins. In young mice, NPCs express the cyclins D1 and D2, but the expression of cyclin D1 is lost during aging, and in adult NPCs only cyclin D2 remains. In young and adult cyclin D2-deficient mice we observed a reduced supply of NPCs to glioblastomas and the generation of larger tumors compared with wild-type mice. We conclude that cyclin D1 and D2 are nonredundant for the antitumor response of subventricular NPCs. Loss of a single D-type cyclin results in a smaller pool of proliferating NPCs, lower number of NPCs migrating to the tumor, and reduced antitumor activity. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18757298
"""Hypermethylation of testis derived transcript gene promoter significantly correlates with worse outcomes in glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal cancer of the central nervous system. Global genomic hypomethylation and some CpG island hypermethylation are common hallmarks of these malignancies, but the effects of these methylation abnormalities on glioblastomas are still largely unclear. Methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter is currently an only confirmed molecular predictor of better outcome in temozolomide treatment. To better understand the relationship between CpG island methylation status and patient outcome, this study launched DNA methylation profiles for thirty-three primary glioblastomas (pGBMs) and nine secondary glioblastomas (sGBMs) with the expectation to identify valuable prognostic and therapeutic targets. Methods: We evaluated the methylation status of testis derived transcript (TES) gene promoter by microarray analysis of glioblastomas and the prognostic value for TES methylation in the clinical outcome of pGBM patients. Significance analysis of microarrays was used for genes significantly differently methylated between 33 pGBM and nine sGBM. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between curves were assessed using the log-rank test. Then, we treated glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U251) with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidines (5-aza-dC) and detected cell biological behaviors. Results: Microarray data analysis identified TES promoter was hypermethylated in pGBMs compared with sGBMs (P < 0.05). Survival curves from the Kaplan-Meier method analysis revealed that the patients with TES hypermethylation had a short overall survival (P < 0.05). This abnormality is also confirmed in glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and U251). Treating these cells with 5-aza-dC released TES protein expression resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Hypermethylation of TES gene promoter highly correlated with worse outcome in pGBM patients. TES might represent a valuable prognostic marker for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23769558
"""Blocking LDHA glycolytic pathway sensitizes glioblastoma cells to radiation and temozolomide.""","""Purpose: Up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase LDHA, is a frequent event in human malignancies and relate to poor postoperative outcome. In the current study we examined the hypothesis that LDHA and anaerobic glycolysis, may contribute to the resistance of glioblastoma to radiotherapy and to temozolomide. Methods and materials: The expression of LDH5 isoenzyme (fully encoded by the LDHA gene) was assessed in human glioblastoma tissues. Experimental in vitro studies involved the T98 and U87 glioblastoma cell lines. Their sensitivity to radiotherapy and to temozolomide, following silencing of LDHA gene or following exposure to the LDHA chemical inhibitor 'oxamate' and to the glycolysis inhibitor '2-deoxy-d-glucose' (2DG), was studied. Results: Glioblastoma tissues showed strong cytoplasmic and nuclear LDH5 expression in 0-90% (median 20%) of the neoplastic cells. T98 and U87 cell lines showed that blocking glycolysis, either with LDHA gene silencing or exposure to oxamate (30 mM) and blockage of glycolysis with 2DG (500 μM), results in enhanced radiation sensitivity, an effect that was more robust in the T98 radioresistant cell line. Furthermore, all three glycolysis targeting methods, significantly sensitized both cell lines to Temozolomide. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that a large subgroup of human glioblastomas are highly glycolytic, and that inhibitors of glycolysis, like LDHA targeting agents, may prove of therapeutic importance by enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy and temozolomide against this lethal disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28756228
"""DNA methylation subclasses predict the benefit from gross total tumor resection in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: DNA methylation-based tumor classification allows an enhanced distinction into subgroups of glioblastoma. However, the clinical benefit of DNA methylation-based stratification of glioblastomas remains inconclusive. Methods: Multicentric cohort study including 430 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma subjected to global DNA methylation profiling. Outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prognostic relevance of EOR and MGMT promoter methylation status as well as a surgical benefit for recurrent glioblastoma. Results: 345 patients (80.2%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 305 patients received combined adjuvant therapy. DNA methylation subclasses RTK I, RTK II, and mesenchymal (MES) revealed no significant survival differences (RTK I: Ref.; RTK II: HR 0.9 [95% CI, 0.64-1.28]; p = 0.56; MES: 0.69 [0.47-1.02]; p = 0.06).

The MES subclass showed no survival benefit for a maximized EOR (GTR/near GTR: Ref.; PR: HR 1.45 [95% CI, 0.68-3.09]; p = 0.33). Therapy response predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation was evident for RTK I (HR 0.37 [95% CI, 0.19-0.71]; p < 0.01) and RTK II (HR 0.56 [95% CI, 0.34-0.91]; p = 0.02) but not the MES subclass (HR 0.52 [95% CI, 0.27-1.02]; p = 0.06).

Conclusion: We demonstrate a survival benefit from maximized EOR for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastomas of the RTK I and RTK II but not the MES subclass. Hence, it needs to be debated whether the MES subclass should be treated with maximal surgical resection, especially when located in eloquent areas and at time of recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35868257

Specimens were studied by conventional ultrathin section and freeze-fracture replica technique. In ultrathin sections of capillaries in glioblastomas, some of these cell junctions were tortuous, elongated, in fact, open. Other capillary abnormalities included endothelial hyperplasia with extensive vesicular formation, surface infolding of endothelial cells, irregularity of the basal lamina and the presence of a large collagen filled extracellular space. In freeze-fracture replicas of capillary endothelium, pinocytotic vesicles markedly increased and were an average fo 52 per micron. Tight junction in one area was seen as network of 6 strands composed of about 100A particles, but in the other areas as one or two strands. In ultrathin sections of astrocytoma, yet there were blood vessels appeared relatively normal. In freeze-fracture replicas, pinocytotic vesicles markedly increased and were an average of 34 per micron. Tight junction was seen as network of 7 strands.

Using CSCs derived from human glioblastomas and a retrovirus expressing VEGF, we examined the effects of VEGF on the properties of CSCs in vitro and in vivo. Although VEGF did not affect the property of CSCs in vitro, the injection of mouse brains with VEGF-expressing CSCs led to the massive expansion of vascular-rich GBM, tumor-associated hemorrhage, and high morbidity, suggesting that VEGF promoted tumorigenesis via angiogenesis.

It has also been suggested that the recurrence of glioblastomas could be achieved by transcriptomic reprograming of tumors, however, their characteristics are not yet fully understood. Here, to gain the mechanistic insights on the molecular phenotypes of recurrent glioblastomas, gene expression profiling was performed on the 43 cases of glioblastomas including 15 paired primary and recurrent cases. Unsupervised clustering analyses revealed two subtypes of G1 and G2, which were characterized by proliferation and neuron-like gene expression traits, respectively. While the primary tumors were classified as G1 subtype, the recurrent glioblastomas showed two distinct expression types. Compared to paired primary tumors, the recurrent tumors in G1 subtype did not show expression alteration. By contrast, the recurrent tumors in G2 subtype showed expression changes from proliferation type to neuron-like one. We also observed the expression of stemness-related genes in G1 recurrent tumors and the altered expression of DNA-repair genes (i.e., AURK, HOX, MGMT, and MSH6) in the G2 recurrent tumors, which might be responsible for the acquisition of drug resistance mechanism during tumor recurrence in a subtype-specific manner. We suggest that recurrent glioblastomas may choose two different strategies for transcriptomic reprograming to escape the chemotherapeutic treatment during tumor recurrence.

We suspect a combination of biological and analytic factors confounds interpretation of glioblastoma expression data. We seek to clarify the nature and relative contributions of these factors, to focus additional investigations, and to improve the accuracy and consistency of translational glioblastoma analyses. Methods: We analyzed gene expression and clinical data for 340 glioblastomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed a logic model to analyze potential sources of biological, technical, and analytic variability and used standard linear classifiers and linear dimensional reduction algorithms to investigate the nature and relative contributions of each factor. Results: Commonly-described sources of classification error, including individual sample characteristics, batch effects, and analytic and technical noise make measurable but proportionally minor contributions to inconsistent molecular classification. Our analysis suggests that three, previously underappreciated factors may account for a larger fraction of classification errors: inherent non-linear/non-orthogonal relationships among the genes used in conjunction with classification algorithms that assume linearity; skewed data distributions assumed to be Gaussian; and biologic variability (noise) among tumors, of which we propose three types. Conclusions: Our analysis of the TCGA data demonstrates a contributory role for technical factors in molecular classification inconsistencies in glioblastoma but also suggests that biological variability, abnormal data distribution, and non-linear relationships among genes may be responsible for a proportionally larger component of classification error.

"""KLF6 depletion promotes NF-kappaB signaling in glioblastoma.""","""Dysregulation of the NF-κB transcription factor occurs in many cancer types. Krüppel-like family of transcription factors (KLFs) regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Here, we report a new mechanism of NF-κB activation in glioblastoma through depletion of the KLF6 tumor suppressor. We show that KLF6 transactivates multiple genes negatively controlling the NF-κB pathway and consequently reduces NF-κB nuclear localization and downregulates NF-κB targets. Reconstitution of KLF6 attenuates their malignant phenotype and induces neural-like differentiation and senescence, consistent with NF-κB pathway inhibition. KLF6 is heterozygously deleted in 74.5% of the analyzed glioblastomas and predicts unfavorable patient prognosis suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a clinically relevant means of evading KLF6-dependent regulation of NF-κB. Together, our study identifies a new mechanism by which KLF6 regulates NF-κB signaling, and how this mechanism is circumvented in glioblastoma through KLF6 loss.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28166199

Immunohistochemistry was carried out using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Aurora-A expression was higher in tumors with high Ki-67 expression (p=0.01) and was positively, though marginally, related to aurora-B expression (p=0.085). Aurora-B expression was not linked to Ki-67 expression (p=0.182).

Here we report that hypoxia significantly stimulated H19 expression in glioblastoma cell lines, which was related to hypoxia-inducible factors 1α (Hif-1α). Hif-1α promoted H19 expression in U87 and U251 cells. Meanwhile PTEN is an advantageous factor to affect H19 expression, through attenuating Hif-1α stability. Hif-1α also positively correlates with H19 in human glioblastoma samples depending on PTEN status. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays showed that Hif-1α induced H19 transcription through directly binding to the H19 promoter. Furthermore, Hif-1α upregulated specific protein 1 (SP1) expression in glioblastomas cells in vitro and in vivo, and SP1 also strongly interacted with the H19 promoter to promote H19 expression under hypoxia. We also showed that H19 acts as a molecular sponge that binds miR-181d, relieving inhibition of β-catenin expression. Therefore, H19 participates in hypoxia-driven migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells. In summary, our results uncover the mechanisms that stimulate H19 expression under hypoxia to promote malignant effects in glioblastomas and suggest H19 might be a promising therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28327666

Results: The model provides clinically realistic predictions of tumour growth and recurrence following therapeutic intervention. Specific results include (i) invasiveness is governed largely by the ability of glioblastoma cells to degrade and migrate through the extracellular matrix and the ability of single migrating cells to form colonies; (ii) tumours originating deeper in the brain generally grow more quickly than those of superficial origin; (iii) upon surgery, the margins and geometry of resection significantly determine the extent and pattern of postoperative recurrence; (iv) radiotherapy works synergistically with greater resection margins to reduce recurrence; (v) simulations in both two- and three-dimensional geometries give qualitatively similar results; and (vi) in an actual clinical case comprising several surgical interventions, the model provides good qualitative agreement between the simulated and observed course of the disease.

"""Selective sensitivity to radiation of cerebral glioblastomas harboring p53 mutations.""","""Recent studies suggest that a balance may exist between the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing functions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Adenoviral p21 transduction attenuates apoptosis, whereas deletion of the p21 gene promotes it, and p21-null xenografts respond better than isogenic p21-wild type tumors to irradiation. Hence, the role of p53 in dictating the clinical response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be more complex than previously thought. We have analyzed survival and radiation response (regrowth-free period) of 42 patients with glioblastomas whose p53 status was determined by a sensitive yeast functional assay. Multivariate analysis revealed that p53 mutation is associated with longer survival (P < 0.02). Among 36 radiation-treated patients, the regrowth-free period after treatment was significantly longer for tumors with p53 mutations (P < 0.0001), and p53 mutation was the sole independent factor predictive of radiotherapeutic response (P < 0.01). Survival time after regrowth was independent of p53 status, suggesting that the difference in survival was related to the treatment rather than to the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor. Thus, in this Northern Japanese population, p53 mutation is a marker for better radiation response in glioblastomas, and this results in significantly longer survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9581814

All 4 patients who survived longer than 24 months had COX-2 negative lesions (p = 0.017). Concordance between COX-2 and VEGF was documented in 60% of the cases.

Total of 11/42 children had seeding metastases (mean 11.5 months) either preoperatively or postoperatively. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 13 patients (30.9%) in the first surgery. Perioperative mortality and morbidity rates were 4.7% and 19%, respectively. Patients were followed for an average of 18.1 months. The median progression-free and overall survivals were 7.0 (95% CI: 5.9-8.0) and 11.0 (95% CI: 8.9-13.1) months, respectively. 1-year, 2-year and 5-year progression-free survival and overall survivals were 30.9% vs. 50.0%, 11.9% vs. 19.0%, 4.8% vs. 9.5%; respectively. Conclusion: Gross total resection should be safely attempted in pediatric GBM. In addition, a thorough and frequent radiological evaluation of the entire neuraxis for seeding metastases is recommended both at diagnosis and follow-ups.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27593770

Normal brain cells show a low or no expression of EGF-R. A mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG2A) (mAb 425) (EMD55900) (Merck KGaA, Bernstadt, Germany) directed against EGF-R was produced for therapeutic use. Eight patients with primary or recurrent, EGF-R-positive glioblastomas entered the study, which was designed to evaluate the clinical effect of the mAb. In order to achieve a high tumor cell saturation, the mAb was injected intratumorally twice weekly through an implantable catheter. The total administered dose varied between 4 mg and 120 mg. In 3 patients with solid tumors, a massive tumor necrosis was noted, with infiltration of macrophages, granulocytes and T cells. A further 3 patients developed clinical and radiological signs of an intense, local, inflammatory reaction. There may be a relation between the mAb dosage and the antitumor effect, insofar as higher doses seemed to cause a more pronounced, inflammatory reaction. Of the 8 patients, 6 developed human, anti-(mouse Ig) antibodies. This anti-EGF-R mAb may induce an intense, inflammatory reaction and a considerable necrosis in glioblastoma. However, the planned schedule could not be completed, even after the dose level was re-adjusted, owing to inflammatory reactions, which were severe without prior tumor debulking.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9191875

Material and methods: This single-center prospective cohort study involved 68 patients aged 25-78 years (38 males and 30 females) with primary glioblastomas. Hypermetylation of the promotor region of the MGMT gene was observed in 24 (42%) out of 57 patients. The IDH1 mutation was revealed in two (3.5%) patients. The catamnestic data were available for 66 out of 68 patients. The first SPECT/CT study was carried out before chemoradiation therapy; the second SPECT/CT study was performed after the chemoradiation therapy. In each study, quantitative measures were calculated for the early (15-30 min after the patient had received a radiopharmaceutical) and late (after 45-60 min) phases. Results: The actuarial survival rates after 12 and 24 months were 69.6 and 29.1%, respectively. The median overall survival rate was 17.5 months (95% CI 12.9-20.3). Favorable prognostic factors for overall survival included the higher uptake index (UI) in the late phase compared to UI in the early phase of the first SPECT/CT study (p=0.0444), dynamics of changes in UI during the second SPECT/CT compared to baseline over 10% (p=0.0436), MGMT hypermethylation (p=0.0003), and duration of the period between surgery and initiation of chemoradiotherapy being <1 month (p=0.0008). No statistically significant correlations were revealed between the absolute UI values in the tumor and its molecular genetic features.

"""Multidimensional communication in the microenvirons of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are heterogeneous and invariably lethal tumours. They are characterized by genetic and epigenetic variations among tumour cells, which makes the development of therapies that eradicate all tumour cells challenging and currently impossible. An important component of glioblastoma growth is communication with and manipulation of other cells in the brain environs, which supports tumour progression and resistance to therapy. Glioblastoma cells recruit innate immune cells and change their phenotype to support tumour growth. Tumour cells also suppress adaptive immune responses, and our increasing understanding of how T cells access the brain and how the tumour thwarts the immune response offers new strategies for mobilizing an antitumour response. Tumours also subvert normal brain cells - including endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes - to create a microenviron that favours tumour success. Overall, after glioblastoma-induced phenotypic modifications, normal cells cooperate with tumour cells to promote tumour proliferation, invasion of the brain, immune suppression and angiogenesis. This glioblastoma takeover of the brain involves multiple modes of communication, including soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines, direct cell-cell contact, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes and microvesicles) and connecting nanotubes and microtubes. Understanding these multidimensional communications between the tumour and the cells in its environs could open new avenues for therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985475

This study investigates the evolution of the tumour extent and evaluates the need for plan adaptation to ensure dose coverage of the target in glioblastoma patients. Materials and methods: The prospective study included 29 patients referred for 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at the time of treatment planning, at fraction 10, 20, 30, and three weeks after the end of radiotherapy. The gross tumour volume (GTV) was defined as the T1w contrast-enhanced region plus the surgical cavity on each MRI set. The relative GTV volume and the maximum distance (Dmax) of the extent of the actual GTV outside the original GTV were measured. Based on the location of the actual GTV during radiotherapy and the original planned dose, a prospective clinical decision was made whether to adapt the treatment. Results: Dose coverage of the GTV during radiotherapy was not compromised, and none of the radiotherapy plans was adapted. The median Dmax (range) was 5.7 (2.0-18.9) mm, 8.0 (2.0-27.4) mm, 8.0 (1.9-27.3) mm, and 8.9 (1.9-34.4) mm at fraction 10, 20, 30, and follow-up. The relative GTV volume and Dmax observed at fraction 10 were correlated with the values observed at follow-up (R = 0.74, p < 0.001 and R = 0.79, p < 0.001, respectively).

A Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify immune-related gene modules. Four immune subtypes (IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4) with significant prognosis differences were obtained. Interestingly, IS4 had the highest mutation rate. We also found significant differences in the distribution of the four subtypes at immune checkpoints, molecular markers, and immune characteristics. WGCNA identified 11 co-expressed module genes, and there were significant differences among the four subtypes. Finally, CD1A, CD1E, and IL23R genes with significant prognostic significance were selected as the final feature genes in the brown module.

Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors mediating the interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment and play important roles in glioma biology, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor stem cell anchorage. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data on integrin inhibition in malignant gliomas. Various pharmacological approaches to the modulation of integrin signaling have been explored including antibodies and peptide-based agents. Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma. Cilengitide had only limited activity as a single agent in glioblastoma, but, when added to standard radiochemotherapy, appeared to prolong progression-free and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas and methylation of the promoter of the O⁶ methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. MGMT gene promoter methylation in turn predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy. A phase III randomized clinical trial in conjunction with standard radiochemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with MGMT gene promoter methylation has recently completed accrual (EORTC 26071-22072). A companion trial explores a dose-escalated regimen of cilengitide added to radiotherapy plus temozolomide in patients without MGMT gene promoter methylation. Promising results in these trials would probably result in a broader interest in integrins as targets for glioma therapy and hopefully the development of a broader panel of anti-integrin agents.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21827415

Here we investigated 70 glioblastomas using the array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) with GenoSensor Array 300 to identify recurrent DNA copy number imbalances associated with patient outcomes. Univariate log-rank analysis of array-CGH data revealed 46 copy number aberrations (CNAs) associated with outcome. Among them, 26 CNAs were associated with shortened survival whereas the remaining 20 CNAs correlated with good prognosis. A hierarchical cluster analysis disclosed two genetically distinct groups of glioblastomas (1 and 2; 56 and 14 tumors, respectively). Univariate log-rank test discerned significant difference in survival between both genetic subsets while the 5-year survival rate consisted of 0 for group 1 and 63% for group 2. Multivariate analysis revealed that unfavorable genetic signature is an independent prognostic factor increasing a risk of patient death (hazard ratio, 4.38; P=0.00001).

Given that the IDH status has critical effects on the survival and epigenetic features of glioblastoma, we aimed to assess the role of MGMT promoter methylation in IDH-mutant glioblastoma. Methods: This study included 187 IDH-mutant glioblastomas and used 173 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas for comparison. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression were used to study the predictive effects. Results: Compared with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, IDH-mutant glioblastomas showed significantly higher (P < 0.0001) MGMT promoter methylation. We demonstrated that MGMT promoter methylation status, as determined by a high cutoff value (≥30%) in pyrosequencing, could be used to significantly stratify the survival of 50 IDH-mutant glioblastomas receiving temozolomide therapy (cohort A); this result was validated in another cohort of 25 IDH-mutant glioblastomas (cohort B).

The role of surgery in glioblastoma with corpus callosum involvement is controversial. In this study, we aimed to examine prognostic differences between glioblastoma with unilateral and glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration, and to evaluate possible treatment strategy implications. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from 2010 to 2019 were included. Corpus callosum infiltration was assessed in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.

Therapy resistance of glioblastomas has been attributed to the presence of tumor initiating stem-like cells (TSCs). TSC-related markers have therefore been suggested to have promising potentials as prognostic markers in gliomas. Methodology/principal findings: The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and prognostic impact of the TSC-related marker Oct-4 in astrocytic brain tumors of increasing grade. In total 114 grade II, III and IV astrocytic brain tumors were immunohistochemically stained for Oct-4, and the fraction and intensity of Oct-4 positive cells were determined by morphometric analysis of full tumor sections. Oct-4 was expressed in all tumors, and the Oct-4 positive cell fraction increased with tumor grade (p = 0.045). There was no association between survival and Oct-4 positive cell fraction, neither when combining all tumor grades nor in analysis of individual grades. Oct-4 intensity was not associated with grade, but taking IDH1 status into account we found a tendency for high Oct-4 intensity to be associated with poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytomas. Double immunofluorescence stainings showed co-localization in the perivascular niches of Oct-4 and two other TSC markers CD133 and nestin in glioblastomas. In some areas Oct-4 was expressed independently of CD133 and nestin. Conclusions: In conclusion, high Oct-4 fraction was associated with tumor malignancy, but seemed to be without independent prognostic influence in glioblastomas.

Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable 'patient tumor's phenocopy' that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333277
"""Clinical and immunohistochemical prognostic factors in adult glioblastoma patients.""","""Objective: Glioblastomas are the commonest and the most malignant of all adult brain tumors, characterized by genetic instability, intratumoral histopathological variability, and unpredictable clinical behavior. The utility of tumor markers that reflect their underlying biology is becoming increasingly important with respect to patient prognostication and their potential role as molecular targets of therapy is being recognized. In this study, we aimed to identify the clinical factors and some immunohistochemical markers that could have an effect on patient survival in supratentorial glioblastomas. Materials and methods: We evaluated 54 cases of adult supratentorial glioblastomas operated over a span of 1 year, with respect to clinical features such as age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), extent of resection, adjuvant therapy, and immunohistochemical expression of p53, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog). Results: Radiotherapy and KPS at presentation were significant predictors of outcome in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Among immunohistochemical variables; loss of PTEN expression in association with over-expression of EGFR showed a trend towards poorer survival, in univariate analysis. Over-expression of EGFR and/or p53 emerged as significant predictors of poor outcome on multivariate analysis, despite failing to prognosticate on univariate analysis. Conclusions: Our study shows that EGFR and p53 overexpression along with loss of PTEN expression are important adjuncts to clinical variables in prognosticating glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19788052
"""Resection versus biopsy in patients with glioblastoma (RESBIOP study): study protocol for an international multicentre prospective cohort study (ENCRAM 2202).""","""Introduction: There are no guidelines or prospective studies defining the optimal surgical treatment for glioblastomas in older patients (≥70 years), for those with a limited functioning performance at presentation (Karnofsky Performance Scale ≤70) or for those with tumours in certain locations (midline, multifocal). Therefore, the decision between resection and biopsy is varied, among neurosurgeons internationally and at times even within an institution. This study aims to compare the effects of maximal tumour resection versus tissue biopsy on survival, functional, neurological and quality of life outcomes in these patient subgroups. Furthermore, it evaluates which modality would maximise the potential to undergo adjuvant treatment. Methods and analysis: This study is an international, multicentre, prospective, two-arm cohort study of an observational nature. Consecutive patients with glioblastoma will be treated with resection or biopsy and matched with a 1:1 ratio. Primary endpoints are (1) overall survival and (2) proportion of patients that have received adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Secondary endpoints are (1) proportion of patients with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale deterioration at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery; (2) progression-free survival (PFS); (3) quality of life at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery and (4) frequency and severity of serious adverse events. The total duration of the study is 5 years. Patient inclusion is 4 years; follow-up is 1 year. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (METC Zuid-West Holland/Erasmus Medical Center; MEC-2020-0812). The results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and disseminated to patient organisations and media.

"""Glioblastomas at the white matter of temporo-parietal junction cause a poor postoperative independence level.""","""Introduction: Right cerebral hemispheric glioblastomas (GBMs) often decrease the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score postoperatively, despite the patient having sufficient patient function while performing daily living. This study aimed to evaluate the factors that could cause poor KPS scores during the postoperative chronic phase in patients with right cerebral hemispheric GBMs. Methods: Data of 47 patients with newly diagnosed right cerebral hemispheric GBMs were analyzed. All patients were assessed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively to determine KPS and brain function. To determine tumor location related to the postoperative KPS scores, we used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). The patients were divided into two groups (involvement and non-involvement groups) based on whether their lesion involved a significant region identified by VLSM. We then compared functional factors and prognosis between the groups using the chi-squared and log-rank tests, respectively. Results: The KPS score significantly decreased after surgery compared to that preoperatively measured (p = 0.023). VLSM revealed that tumors in the white matter of temporo-parietal junction (WM-TPJ) caused a significant decline in the KPS score at three months postoperatively. The patients in the involvement group had a higher probability of impaired attention, visuospatial cognition, emotion recognition, and visual field than did those in the non-involvement group. In addition, tumor in the WM-TPJ were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival (p = 0.039 and 0.023, respectively). Conclusions: GBMs involving the right WM-TPJ are more likely to result in poor postoperative KPS scores and prognoses. Impairments of several kinds of brain functions caused by tumor invasion to the WM-TPJ may be associated with lower KPS scores.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37847481
"""Detrended fluctuation analysis of genome-wide copy number profiles of glioblastomas using array-based comparative genomic hybridization.""","""We examined whole genomic aberrations of biopsied samples from 19 independent glioblastomas by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis. The highest frequencies of copy number gains were observed on RFC2 (73.3%), EGFR (63.2%), and FGR, ELN, CDKN1C , FES, TOP2A, and ARSA (57.9% each). The highest frequencies of copy number losses were detected on TBR1 (52.6%), BMI1 (52.6%), EGR2 (47.4%), DMBT1 (47.4%), MTAP (42.1%), and FGFR2 (42.1%). The copy number gains of CDKN1C and INS and the copy number losses of TBR1 were significantly correlated with longer survival of patients. High-level amplifications were identified on EGFR, SAS/CDK4, PDGFRA, MDM2, and ARSA. These genes are assumed to be involved in tumorigenesis or progression of glioblastomas. The first attempts to apply detrended fluctuation analysis to copy number profiles by considering the reading direction as the time axis demonstrated that higher long-term fractal scaling exponents (alpha2) correlated well with longer survival of glioblastoma patients. The present study indicates that array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis has great potential for assessment of copy number changes and altered chromosomal regions of brain tumors. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear analysis methods of whole genome copy number profiles may provide prognostic information about glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15494095
"""Glioblastoma with Probable Intratumoral Adenocarcinoma Metastasis: A Rare Report with Review of Literature.""","""'Tumor-to-tumor metastasis,' an uncommon phenomenon, refers to a primary tumor metastasis into another tumor, with the most frequent donor being lung carcinoma and common recipients being renal cell carcinoma and meningioma. Tumor-to-tumor metastasis occurring in gliomas is rare with less than 20 reports described so far, and that into a glioblastoma is even rarer. We report a 54-year man, diagnosed with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, with metastasis of an adenocarcinoma into it. On histomorphology, the glial component was composed of astrocytic cells and showed increased mitosis, microvascular proliferation, and focal necrosis. This was intermingled with an adenocarcinomatous tumor with pleomorphic epithelial cells in glands, nests, and sheets. On immunohistochemistry, the adenocarcinomatous areas were positive for AE1/AE3 and TTF1 but negative for glial markers, ruling out adenoid glioblastoma. Further cytogenetic analysis showed EGFR amplification in the glial component but not in the adenocarcinoma component, ruling out glioblastoma with true epithelial metaplasia, and supporting the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma metastasis into glioblastoma. Glioblastomas may be susceptible to intratumoral metastasis due to the proliferating leaky vascular channels, however, the short survival of patients with glioblastoma may be responsible for the rarity of this occurrence. The documentation of these tumors is important as they may be important for clinical diagnosis and further treatment and prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38378180

"""Regional differences in bromodeoxyuridine uptake, expression of Ki-67 protein, and nucleolar organizer region counts in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""To investigate intratumoral differences in indices of tumor cell proliferation, we measured the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (BrdUrd LI), the Ki-67 protein proliferating cell indices (PCIs) determined by monoclonal antibody MIB 1 in microwave-processed paraffin sections (MIB 1 PCI) and in some cases by monoclonal antibody in frozen sections (Ki-67 PCI), and counts of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) in 20 glioblastomas. In the most actively proliferating areas, MIB 1 and Ki-67 PCIs correlated well with the BrdUrd LI and with each other, while AgNOR counts correlated less strongly with these indices. In less active areas, the MIB 1 PCI and BrdUrd LI changed concomitantly from one area to another within a tumor except in areas of pseudopalisading with necrosis; in these areas the BrdUrd LI decreased significantly compared with neighboring tumor tissue, while the MIB 1 PCI did not. There was very little staining of gemistocytic nuclei with either anti-BrdUrd or MIB 1 monoclonal antibodies; this supports the concept that gemistocytes are mainly quiescent cells. AgNORs in all of the above-mentioned areas varied from tumor to tumor, which suggests that they may indicate some cellular activity other than proliferation. The close correlation between the BrdUrd LI and Ki-67 protein PCIs in corresponding regions of glioblastomas suggests that MIB 1 staining of microwave-processed paraffin sections can be used to evaluate the growth potential of individual glioblastomas and possibly of other gliomas as well.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8091951
"""Nanobodies targeting ABCC3 for immunotargeted applications in glioblastoma.""","""The cancer 'omics' reveal many clinically relevant alterations that are transforming the molecular characterization of glioblastomas. However, many of these findings are not yet translated into clinical practice due, in part, to the lack of non-invasive biomarkers and the limitations imposed by the blood-brain barrier. Nanobodies, camelid single-domain antibody fragments, emerge as a promising tool for immunotargeted applications for diagnosing and treating glioblastomas. Performing agnostic bioinformatic analysis from glioblastoma patient datasets, we identified ATP Binding Cassette subfamily C member 3 (ABCC3) as a suitable target for immunotargeted applications. The expression of ABCC3 is associated with poor survival and impaired response to temozolomide. Importantly, high expression of ABCC3 is restricted to glioblastoma, with negligible levels in healthy brain tissue, and further correlates with tumor grade and stemness markers. We identified three immunogenic epitopes of ABCC3 which were used to isolate nanobodies from a glioblastoma-specific phage-display nanobody library. Two nanobodies targeting ABCC3 (NbA42 and NbA213) were further characterized and demonstrated in vivo selective recognition of ABCC3 in glioblastoma xenograft mouse models upon systemic administration. We designate NbA42 and NbA213 as new candidates to implement immunotargeted applications guiding a more personalized and precise diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36585418
"""Intra-operative radiation therapy for malignant brain tumors: rationale, method, and treatment results of cerebral glioblastomas.""","""In radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours, the dose of radiation that can be safely delivered to a tumour is limited by the radiation tolerance of the adjacent normal brain tissue. Among various radiation modalities to produce local tumour eradication without unacceptable complications, we chose a large, single irradiation dose during the operation (intra-operative radiation therapy, IORT). In contrast to X-ray or Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, IORT with a high-energy electron beam delivered by the Shimadzu 20 MeV betatron provides acceptable dose homogeneity with rapid fall-off of the radiation dose beyond the treatment volume. Thus, IORT has the advantage of precise demarcation of the target volume, minimum damage to surrounding normal tissues, and a high absorbed target dose (15-25 Gy in 5-10 min). On the basis of our experience with 170 patients treated by IORT, we established the treatment indications and method in patients with malignant brain tumours. IORT with a dose of 15-25 Gy was delivered to widely resected tumours followed by external radiation therapy. No acute or subacute complications were observed. Treatment results of 30 patients with glioblastoma treated by IORT (mean 18.3 Gy) combined with external radiation therapy (mean 58.5 Gy) resulted in a median survival of 119 weeks and a 2-year survival rate of 61%.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7709789
"""Activation of EGFR signaling from pilocytic astrocytomas to glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: EGFR analyses allow for better correlation between genotype and phenotype in astrocytomas and represent an attractive therapeutic target. Most studies emphasize analyses of EGFR in glioblastomas (GBMs) but do not analyze all grades of astrocytomas (from pilocytic to GBM). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the status of EGFR (expression, deletion, and amplification) and EGFR protein expression in all grades of astrocytomas. Patients and methods: We analyzed a total of 145 surgical tumor specimens that included: 22 pilocytic astrocytomas, 22 grade II astrocytomas, 17 grade III astrocytomas and 84 GBMs. The specimens were compared to 17 non-neoplastic brain tissues obtained from epilepsy surgery. EGFR expression, EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII analyses were performed by quantitative real-time PCR, and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: EGFR relative overexpression and EGFR amplification were observed, respectively, in 50% and 20% of astrocytomas, while EGFRvIII was only found in GBMs (34.5%, p=0.005). Amongst EGFR-amplified GBM cases, 59% also presented EGFRvIII (p<0.001). Cytoplasmic accumulation of EGFR protein was detected in 75% of astrocytomas, and 21% of the astrocytomas showed nuclear localization (p=0.003). Conclusions: EGFR alterations were found in all grades of astrocytomas, from pilocytic to GBMs, while EGFRvIII was exclusively found in GBMs. These findings provide important information on the mechanisms involved in the progression of astrocytomas for determining whether EGFR status can be used for effective and specific therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24170555
"""Prognostic and clinical implication of IL-6 expression in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is frequently produced in gliomas and has been implicated as a mediator of growth control in several human neoplasms.

The relationships between IL-6 expression level and clinical presentation, survival, imaging findings, age and preoperative Karnofsky performance status were analyzed. The median survival times were 16 months in patients with negative IL-6 expression and 7 months in those with positive IL-6 expression (P = 0.075). Three of these patients with a relatively longer survival time (> 1 year) did not express IL-6 in the tumor. Relatively more severe peri-focal edema on imaging was also noted in the glioblastomas with IL-6 expression. IL-6 was also found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of newly formed vessels and infiltrating inflammatory cells. These preliminary results implicate IL-6 expression as a possible prognostic indicator in glioblastoma. This cytokine may also play a role in tissue edema, angiogenesis and inflammation of this tumor, but whether IL-6 expression promotes malignancy is uncertain.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16326273

Currently, it is unknown whether multiple types of transformed precursors, which display alternative sets of the complement of properties of true cancer stem cells, can be found in a GBM. If different subsets of such cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) do exist, they might represent distinct cell targets, with a differential therapeutic importance, also depending on their characteristics and lineage relationship. Here, we report the presence of two types of CSCs within different regions of the same human GBM. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis shows that the two types of CSCs bear quite diverse tumorigenic potential and distinct genetic anomalies, and, yet, derive from common ancestor cells. This provides critical information to unravel the development of CSCs and the key molecular/genetic components underpinning tumorigenicity in human GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19287454
"""Quantifying Uncertainty and Robustness in a Biomathematical Model-Based Patient-Specific Response Metric for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness. A growing body of literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the proliferation-invasion model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, days gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Furthermore, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. Although promising, the original article did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric, leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. Methods: We harnessed the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: (1) image acquisition and (2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first used synthetic data to characterize what nonerror variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then considered the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Results: Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pretreatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort, there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression was over 80% reliable. Conclusion: Although additional validation must be performed, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758984
"""Long-Term Time Series Forecasting and Updates on Survival Analysis of Glioblastoma Multiforme: A 1975-2018 Population-Based Study.""","""Objective: Glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs) are the most common primary CNS tumors. Epidemiologic studies have investigated the effect of demographics on patient survival, but the literature remains inconclusive. Methods: This study included all adult patients with intracranial GBMs reported in the surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER)-9 population database (1975-2018). The sample consisted of 32,746 unique entries. We forecast the annual GBM incidence in the US population through the year 2060 using time series analysis with autoregressive moving averages. A survival analysis of the GBM-specific time to death was also performed. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression revealed frank violations of the PH assumption for multiple covariates. Parametric models best described the GBM population's survival pattern; the results were compared to the semi-parametric analysis and the published literature. Results: We predicted an increasing GBM incidence, which demonstrated that by the year 2060, over 1,800 cases will be reported annually in the SEER. All eight demographic variables were significant in the univariable analysis. The calendar year 2005 was the cutoff associated with an increased survival probability. A male survival benefit was eliminated in the year-adjusted Cox. Infratentorial tumors, nonmetropolitan areas, and White patient race were the factors erroneously associated with survival in the multivariate Cox analysis. Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) lognormal regression was the best model to describe the survival pattern in our patient population, identifying age >30 years old as a poor prognostic and patients >70 years old as having the worst survival. Annual income >USD 75,000 and supratentorial tumors had good prognostics, while surgical intervention provided the strongest survival benefit. Conclusions: Annual GBM incidence rates will continue to increase by almost 50% in the upcoming 30 years. Cox regression analysis should not be utilized for time-to-event predictions in GBM survival statistics. AFT lognormal distribution best describes the GBM-specific survival pattern, and as an inherent population characteristic, it should be implemented by researchers for future studies. Surgical intervention provides the strongest survival benefit, while patient age >70 years old is the worst prognostic. Based on our study, the demographics such as gender, race, and county type should not be considered as meaningful prognostics when designing future trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172317

Despite a general policy during the study period of treatment by surgical intervention aimed at maximum tumor removal followed by radiotherapy, there was a marked tendency toward limited treatment with advancing patient age. Of those younger than 65 years, 82% were treated either with surgery followed by radiotherapy, surgery alone or radiotherapy alone, versus 47% of patients 65 years or older. Only 25% of patients older than 75 years underwent surgery and/or radiotherapy, while the remaining patients were given best supportive care (BSC). The mean ages of patients were 54.5 years for those treated with surgery and radiotherapy, 58.3 years for surgery alone, 62.2 years for radiotherapy alone and 69.2 years for BSC. Among patients who were treated with surgery plus radiotherapy and those treated with radiotherapy alone, younger patients (<60 years) had a significantly higher survival rate than older patients (>or=60 years). In contrast, no significant difference in survival was observed between younger and older patients treated with surgery alone or receiving BSC, suggesting that lower survival rates in elderly patients with glioblastoma may be at least in part due to a lesser response to radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19325245
"""The prognosis of glioblastoma: a large, multifactorial study.""","""Objective: Glioblastoma is the most common and fatal primary brain tumor in adults. Even with maximal resection and a series of postoperative adjuvant treatments, the median overall survival (OS) of glioblastoma patients remains approximately 15 months. The Huashan Hospital glioma bank contains more than 2000 glioma tissue samples with long-term follow-up data; almost half of these samples are from glioblastoma patients. Several large glioma databases with long-term follow-up data have reported outcomes of glioblastoma patients from countries other than China. We investigated the prognosis of glioblastoma patients in China and compared the survival outcomes among patients from different databases. Methods: The data for 967 glioblastoma patients who underwent surgery at Huashan Hospital and had long-term follow-up records were obtained from our glioma registry (diagnosed from 29 March 2010, through 7 June 2017). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they underwent surgical resection for newly diagnosed glioblastomas and had available data of survival and personal information. Data of 778 glioblastoma patients were collected from three separate online databases (448 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov), 191 from REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) database (GSE108476) and 132 from data set GSE16011(Hereafter called as the French database). We compared the prognosis of glioblastoma patients from records among the different databases and the changes in survival outcomes of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over an 8-year period. Results: The median OS of glioblastoma patients was 16.3 (95% CI: 15.4-17.2) months for Huashan Hospital, 13.8 (95% CI: 12.9-14.9) months for TCGA, 19.3 (95% CI: 17.0-20.0) months for the REMBRANDT database, and 9.1 months for the French database. The median OS of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital improved from 15.6 (2010-2013, 95% CI: 14.4-16.6) months to 18.2 (2014-2017, 95% CI: 15.8-20.6) months over the study period (2010-2017). In addition, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients with total resection was significantly better than that of glioblastoma patients with sub-total resection or biopsy. Conclusions: Our study confirms that treatment centered around maximal surgical resection brought survival benefits to glioblastoma patients after adjusting to validated prognostic factors. In addition, an improvement in prognosis was observed among glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over the course of our study. We attributed it to the adoption of a new standard of neurosurgical treatment on the basis of neurosurgical multimodal technologies.

Results: In 33 out 34 patients for which the CT-study showing tumour-recurrence was available the recurrence was completely situated within the original 90%-isodose. Only one tumour surpassed the outside surface of the PTV but was predominantly situated within the original tumourbed and suggests a tumour-regrowth within the high dose volume.

We investigated 80 primary untreated GBM using both G-banding analysis and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH). Abnormal karyotypes were found in 83% of the tumors. The most common numerical chromosome aberrations were +7, -10, -13, -14, -15, +20, and -22. Structural abnormalities most commonly involved chromosomes 1 and 3, and the short arm of chromosome 9. HR-CGH verified these findings and revealed additional frequent losses at 1p34-36, 6q22-27, and 19q12-13 and gains of 3q26 and 12q13-15. Although most karyotypes and gain/loss patterns were complex, there was also a distinct subset of tumors displaying simple karyotypic changes only. There was a statistically significant association between trisomy 7 and monosomy 10, and also between +7/-10 as putative primary aberrations and secondary losses of 1p, 9p, 13q, and 22q. The low number of tumors in the rarer histological tumor subgroups precludes definite conclusions, but there did not seem to be any clear-cut cytogenetic-pathological correlations, perhaps with the exception of ring chromosomes in giant cell glioblastomas.

"""Differentiating Tumor Progression from Pseudoprogression in Patients with Glioblastomas Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI.""","""Background and purpose: Early assessment of treatment response is critical in patients with glioblastomas. A combination of DTI and DSC perfusion imaging parameters was evaluated to distinguish glioblastomas with true progression from mixed response and pseudoprogression. Materials and methods: Forty-one patients with glioblastomas exhibiting enhancing lesions within 6 months after completion of chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent surgery after MR imaging and were histologically classified as having true progression (>75% tumor), mixed response (25%-75% tumor), or pseudoprogression (<25% tumor). Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, planar anisotropy coefficient, spheric anisotropy coefficient, and maximum relative cerebral blood volume values were measured from the enhancing tissue. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best model for classification of true progression from mixed response or pseudoprogression. Results: Significantly elevated maximum relative cerebral blood volume, fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, and planar anisotropy coefficient and decreased spheric anisotropy coefficient were observed in true progression compared with pseudoprogression (P < .05). There were also significant differences in maximum relative cerebral blood volume, fractional anisotropy, planar anisotropy coefficient, and spheric anisotropy coefficient measurements between mixed response and true progression groups. The best model to distinguish true progression from non-true progression (pseudoprogression and mixed) consisted of fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, and maximum relative cerebral blood volume, resulting in an area under the curve of 0.905. This model also differentiated true progression from mixed response with an area under the curve of 0.901. A combination of fractional anisotropy and maximum relative cerebral blood volume differentiated pseudoprogression from nonpseudoprogression (true progression and mixed) with an area under the curve of 0.807. Conclusions: DTI and DSC perfusion imaging can improve accuracy in assessing treatment response and may aid in individualized treatment of patients with glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26450533
"""Combining intraoperative carmustine wafers and Stupp regimen in multimodal first-line treatment of primary glioblastomas.""","""Background: The study investigated if intraoperative use of carmustine wafers, particularly in combination with Stupp regimen, is a viable and safe first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. Methods: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years) with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 ± 1.7) were retrospectively studied. Results: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial resection (13 months; p = 0.011). Conclusions: The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. The prognostic value of this treatment association should be evaluated in a multicenter trial, ideally in a randomized and placebo-controlled one.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25724425
"""EGFR Amplification and IDH Mutations in Glioblastoma Patients of the Northeast of Morocco.""","""Glioblastomas are the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumors which are expressing various evolutions, aggressiveness, and prognosis. Thus, the 2007 World Health Organization classification based solely on the histological criteria is no longer sufficient. It should be complemented by molecular analysis for a true histomolecular classification. The new 2016 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system uses molecular parameters in addition to histology to reclassify these tumors and reduce the interobserver variability. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of IDH mutations and EGFR amplifications in the population of the northeast region of Morocco and then to compare the results with other studies. Methods. IDH1 codon 132 and IDH2 codon 172 were directly sequenced and the amplification of exon 20 of EGFR gene was investigated by qPCR in 65 glioblastoma tumors diagnosed at the University Hospital of Fez between 2010 and 2014. Results. The R132H IDH1 mutation was observed in 8 of 65 tumor samples (12.31%). No mutation of IDH2 was detected. EGFR amplification was identified in 17 cases (26.15%). Conclusion.

Accordingly, we attempted to assess the influence of EGFR expression on the survival of GBM patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy. Materials and methods: Thirty three GBM patients who had received surgery and postoperative radiotherapy at our institute, between March 1997 and February 2006, were included. The evaluation of EGFR expression with immunohistochemistry was available for 30 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: EGFR was expressed in 23 patients (76.7%), and not expressed in seven (23.3%). Survival in EGFR expressing GBM patients was significantly less than that in non-expressing patients (median survival: 12.5 versus 17.5 months, p=0.013). Patients who received more than 60 Gy showed improved survival over those who received up to 60 Gy (median survival: 17.0 versus 9.0 months, p=0.000). Negative EGFR expression and a higher radiation dose were significantly correlated with improved survival on multivariate analysis. Survival rates showed no differences according to age, sex, and surgical extent. Conclusion: The expression of EGFR demonstrated a significantly deleterious effect on the survival of GBM patients. Therefore, approaches targeting EGFR should be considered in potential treatment methods for GBM patients, in addition to current management strategies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23225805

Their malignant counterparts, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, are lethal neoplasms with poor clinical outcome and they frequently carry mutations of TP53 tumor suppressor gene. In order to determine the frequency and type of this molecular alteration in the Polish population, we analyzed the polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to the most conservative exons 5-8 for single-strand conformation polymorphism and confirmed the presence of mutations by direct DNA sequencing. We identified mutations in one of five (20%) anaplastic astrocytomas and in eight of 28 (29%) glioblastomas; the mutations were most frequently identified in the exon 8 (six glioblastomas).

We analyzed 10 newly diagnosed cases of glioblastomas. For these PBZs, histopathological investigation was performed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry was analyzed for CD31, CD34, Factor VIII, VEGF, VEGFR-1/2, Ki67, p53 and nestin. Although it was difficult to identify PBZ by H&E, Ki67 and p53 staining, there were apparent differences in nestin staining among PBZ, tumor core (TC), and normal zone (NZ). Therefore, in this study, we divided PBZ from TC and NZ by nestin staining. Differences in histological features, microvessel density, expression of VEGF and its receptors were assessed for PBZ, TC and NZ. The microvessel density, as determined by counting CD31, CD34 and VEGF receptors, and VEGF-A expression were lower in PBZ than TC. The expression patterns for CD31, CD34 and VEGF receptors in vessels show dissociation in PBZ. In addition, the vascular characteristics of the PBZ may correlate with findings of radiographic imaging.

The median age was 50 years and the median preoperative Karnofsky rate was 80. Twenty-one patients (68%) had glioblastoma multiforme, and 10 patients (32%) had anaplastic astrocytoma. Early postoperative enhanced computed tomography was used to determine the extent of tumor resection. Gross total tumor resection was accomplished in 19 patients (61%), and subtotal resection was performed in 12 patients (39%). The two groups were comparable regarding age, sex, pathological condition, preoperative Karnofsky rating, tumor location, postoperative radiation therapy, and postoperative chemotherapy (P greater than 0.05). The gross total resection group lived longer than the subtotal resection group by life table analysis (P less than 0.001; median survival of 90 and 43 weeks, respectively). Postoperatively, the mean functional ability measured by the Karnofsky rating was significantly increased in the gross total resection group (P = 0.006), but not in the subtotal resection group (P greater than 0.05). The difference in degree of change between preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky rating in the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.002). The gross total resection group spent significantly more time after the operation in an independent status (Karnofsky rating greater than or equal to 80) compared to the subtotal resection group (P = 0.007; median time of 185 and 12.5 weeks, respectively).

Here, we determined MGMT activity in primary and recurrent glioblastomas (GBM, WHO grade IV) of patients who received radiation therapy (RT) or RT plus chemotherapy with alkylating agents (temozolomide, chloroethylnitrosoureas). The mean MGMT activity of untreated GBM was 37 +/- 45 (range 0-205) fmol/mg proteins. In the 1st, 2nd and 3rd recurrences, MGMT activity increased from 66 +/- 50 (13-194) to 68 +/- 44 (14-143) and 182 +/- 163 (64-423) fmol/mg protein, respectively. Comparing patients who received RT only with RT plus chemotherapy, a significant increase of MGMT in 1st recurrences was only found after treatment with RT plus chemotherapy, indicating either selection of MGMT expressing cells or induction of the MGMT gene by alkylating agents. The p53 status was not significantly related to the MGMT expression level, although a trend for lower MGMT activity in p53 positively stained tumors was observed. Patients expressing MGMT activity of <or=30 fmol/mg protein in the pretreatment tumor had a significant better therapeutic response than patients expressing MGMT above this level, which was shown by Kaplan-Meyer curves and the recurrence free interval after primary tumor resection. In patients who received RT only, this correlation was not found. The data revealed a threshold of MGMT expression (30 fmol/mg protein) below which patients respond better to alkylating agents. Therefore, determination of MGMT activity in the primary tumor appears to be useful in predicting the outcome of GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18000822
"""Resolving the lineage relationship between malignant cells and vascular cells in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant and heterogeneous brain tumor, contains various types of tumor and non-tumor cells. Whether GBM cells can trans-differentiate into non-neural cell types, including mural cells or endothelial cells (ECs), to support tumor growth and invasion remains controversial. Here we generated two genetic GBM models de novo in immunocompetent mouse brains, mimicking essential pathological and molecular features of human GBMs. Lineage-tracing and transplantation studies demonstrated that, although blood vessels in GBM brains underwent drastic remodeling, evidence of trans-differentiation of GBM cells into vascular cells was barely detected. Intriguingly, GBM cells could promiscuously express markers for mural cells during gliomagenesis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing showed that patterns of copy number variations (CNVs) of mural cells and ECs were distinct from those of GBM cells, indicating discrete origins of GBM cells and vascular components. Importantly, single-cell CNV analysis of human GBM specimens also suggested that GBM cells and vascular cells are likely separate lineages. Rather than expansion owing to trans-differentiation, vascular cell expanded by proliferation during tumorigenesis. Therefore, cross-lineage trans-differentiation of GBM cells is very unlikely to occur during gliomagenesis. Our findings advance understanding of cell lineage dynamics during gliomagenesis, and have implications for targeted treatment of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36929001
"""The Glycoprotein M6a Is Associated with Invasiveness and Radioresistance of Glioblastoma Stem Cells.""","""Systematic recurrence of glioblastoma (GB) despite surgery and chemo-radiotherapy is due to GB stem cells (GBSC), which are particularly invasive and radioresistant. Therefore, there is a need to identify new factors that might be targeted to decrease GBSC invasive capabilities as well as radioresistance. Patient-derived GBSC were used in this study to demonstrate a higher expression of the glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A) in invasive GBSC compared to non-invasive cells. In 3D invasion assays performed on primary neurospheres of GBSC, we showed that blocking GPM6A expression by siRNA significantly reduced cell invasion. We also demonstrated a high correlation of GPM6A with the oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPRZ1, which regulates GPM6A expression and cell invasion. The results of our study also show that GPM6A and PTPRZ1 are crucial for GBSC sphere formation. Finally, we demonstrated that targeting GPM6A or PTPRZ1 in GBSC increases the radiosensitivity of GBSC. Our results suggest that blocking GPM6A or PTPRZ1 could represent an interesting approach in the treatment of glioblastoma since it would simultaneously target proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35883571

We also discuss the proposal that CSCs are resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and play a major role in repopulating tumors following treatment. To overcome their resistance to conventional therapies, we may be able to use our extensive knowledge of the signaling pathways essential for stem cells during development.

"""A functional screen identifies miRs that induce radioresistance in glioblastomas.""","""The efficacy of radiotherapy in many tumor types is limited by normal tissue toxicity and by intrinsic or acquired radioresistance. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular network responsible for regulating radiosensitivity/resistance. Here, an unbiased functional screen identified four microRNAs (miR1, miR125a, miR150, and miR425) that induce radioresistance. Considering the clinical importance of radiotherapy for patients with glioblastoma, the impact of these miRNAs on glioblastoma radioresistance was investigated. Overexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with TGFβ signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGFβ and antagonized by a TGFβ receptor inhibitor. Together, these results identify and characterize a new role for miR425, miR1, miR125, and miR150 in promoting radioresistance in glioblastomas and provide insight into the therapeutic application of TGFβ inhibitors in radiotherapy. Implications: Systematic identification of miRs that cause radioresistance in gliomas is important for uncovering predictive markers for radiotherapy or targets for overcoming radioresistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256711

In the present study, a more objective way of distinguishing between the three types of tumour is sought. Frozen sections from 26 astrocytomas, 26 anaplastic astrocytomas and 38 glioblastomas were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 which binds to nuclear proteins in the G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. The Ki-67 staining was assessed quantitatively through direct observation of the stained sections by the use of a drawing tube attached to a microscope. A minimum of 1000 cells was counted in each case and labelled cells were expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. These results, when correlated in each case with the histology of the tumour in paraffin sections, showed Ki-67 labelling indices ranging from 0 to 1.9% (mean 0.5% SD +/- 0.54) in astrocytomas, 0.6 to 10.9% (mean 4.1% SD +/- 2.8) in anaplastic astrocytomas and 0.9 to 16.2% (mean 6.4% SD +/- 3.34) in glioblastoma multiforme.

Sixty nine patients undergoing GBM resection with CDKN2A status determined by whole-exome sequencing were included. GBMs on magnetic resonance images were automatically 3D segmented using deep learning algorithms incorporated within PACS. VASARI features were assessed using FHIR forms integrated within PACS. GBMs without CDKN2A alterations were significantly larger (64 vs. 30%, p = 0.007) compared to tumors with homozygous deletion (HOMDEL) and heterozygous loss (HETLOSS). Lesions larger than 8 cm were four times more likely to have no CDKN2A alteration (OR: 4.3; 95% CI 1.5-12.1; p < 0.001). We developed a novel integrated PACS informatics platform for the assessment of GBM molecular subtypes and show that tumors with HOMDEL are more likely to have radiographic evidence of pial invasion and less likely to have deep white matter invasion or subependymal invasion.

"""When did the glioblastoma start growing, and how much time can be gained from surgical resection? A model based on the pattern of glioblastoma growth in vivo.""","""Objectives: Observational data on the natural course of tumor growth in humans is sparse, and mathematical models of tumor growth are often needed to answer questions related to growth. In this study, a theoretical model of glioblastoma growth was used to investigate two questions often asked by patients and clinicians. First, when did the tumor start growing? Second, how much survival time can be gained from various extents of surgical resection (EOR)?. Patients and methods: A gompertzian growth curve was fitted from observational data of pre-treatment growth from 106 glioblastoma patients based on repeated volume segmentations. The curve was used to find the theoretical time since tumor initiation. In addition, as a proxy for the potential survival gain from surgery, the number of days until re-growth would reach the preoperative tumor volume were calculated for different extents of resection. Results: The estimated age of the glioblastomas at diagnosis was median 330 days, but ranging from 156 days to 776 days, depending on the tumor volume at diagnosis. The median survival gains from 50%, 75%, 90%, 95% and 99% EOR were, 1.4, 2.5, 3.6, 4.3, and 5.6 months, respectively. However, survival benefit from surgery also depends on lesion volume. In theory, 100 days may be gained from 95% EOR in a 10 mL lesion or a 50% EOR in a 90 ml lesion. Conclusion: In conclusion, we postulate that glioblastoma might originate median 330 days before the diagnosis, assuming the same growth pattern and biology from day one. The theoretical survival benefit of glioblastoma resection is much higher with higher EORs, suggesting that the last milliliters of resection matter the most. Our data also suggest that gain from resection is higher in larger lesions, suggesting that lesion volume may be taken into account in clinical decision-making.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727799

Five GBMs exhibiting epithelial differentiation were microdissected and analyzed for mutations in the TP53 gene. SSCP analysis of exons 5-8 was followed by direct sequencing of aberrantly migrating fragments. TP53 mutations were identified in tumors from two of five patients. A G-->T transversion in codon 176 was detected in a tumor, initially diagnosed as metastases of unknown origin, however, a later autopsy revealed GBM. In this lesion, the mutation was observed in both, areas of astrocytic differentiation and areas of epithelial differentiation. One tumor diagnosed as GBM with epithelial differentiation carried C-->T transition in codon 211 in both, areas of astrocytic and epithelial differentiation. Thus, molecular analysis proved clonality in two GBMs with epithelial differentiation, thereby excluding a collision tumor.

In this study we aimed to determine the frequency and prognostic value of TERTp mutations and TERT rs2853669 SNP in 504 gliomas from Portuguese and Brazilian patients. TERTp mutations were detected in 47.8% of gliomas (216/452). Glioblastomas (GBM) exhibited the highest frequency of TERTp mutations (66.9%); in this glioma subtype, we found a significant association between TERTp mutations and poor prognosis, regardless of the population. Moreover, in a multivariate analysis, TERTp mutations were the only independent prognostic factor. Our data also showed that the poor prognosis conferred by TERTp mutations was restricted to GBM patients carrying the rs2853669 A allele and not in those carrying the G allele. In conclusion, the presence of TERTp mutations was associated with worse prognosis in GBM patients, although such association depended on the status of the rs2853669 SNP.

To tackle this problem, the proposed Raidionics open-source software has been developed, offering both a user-friendly graphical user interface and stable processing backend. The software includes preoperative segmentation models for each of the most common tumor types (i.e., glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases), together with one early postoperative glioblastoma segmentation model. Preoperative segmentation performances were quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an average Dice around 85% and patient-wise recall and precision around 95%. Postoperatively, performances were lower with an average Dice of 41%. Overall, the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the tumor segmentation and features computation, requires about ten minutes on a regular laptop.

Our purpose was to present the outcomes of our experience and compare them with other literature reports to investigate the potential influence of different intraoperative monitoring strategies and to evaluate the role of intraoperative data on neurological and radiological outcomes in our series. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively collected database of GBM involving the motor pathways. Each patient underwent tumor exeresis with intraoperative 5-ALA fluorescence visualization. Our monitoring strategy was based on direct stimulation (DS), combined with cortical or transcranial MEPs. The radiological outcome was evaluated with CRET vs. residual tumor, and the neurological outcome as improved, unchanged, or worsened. We also performed a literature review to compare our results with state-of-the-art on the subject. Results: Sixty-five patients were included. CRET was 63.1%, permanent postoperative impairment was 1.5%, and DS's lowest motor threshold was 5 mA. In the literature, CRET was 25-73%, permanent postoperative impairment 3-16%, and DS lowest motor threshold was 1-3 mA. Our monitoring strategy identified a motor pathway in 60% of cases in faint fluorescent tissue, and its location in bright/faint fluorescence was predictive of CRET (p < 0.001). A preoperative motor deficit was associated with a worse clinical outcome (p < 0.001). Resection of bright fluorescent tissue was stopped in 26%, and fluorescence type of residual tumor was associated with higher CRET grades (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Based on the data presented and the current literature, distinct monitoring strategies can achieve different onco-functional outcomes in 5-ALA-guided resection of a glioblastoma (GBM) motor pathway. Intraoperatively, functional and fluorescence data close to a bright/vague interface could be helpful to predict onco-functional outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36087121

Searching for new markers of glioblastomas is of great significance for improving the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of glioma. Methods: Using the GEO public database, we combined 34 glioma microarray datasets containing 1893 glioma samples and conducted genetic data mining through statistical analysis, bioclustering, and pathway analysis. The results were validated in TCGA, CGGA, and internal cohorts. We further selected a gene for subsequent experiments and conducted cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses to verify the biological function of this gene. Results: Eight glioblastoma-specific differentially expressed genes were screened using GEO. In the TCGA and CGGA cohorts, patients with high CBX3, BARD1, EGFR, or IFRD1 expression had significantly shorter survival but patients with high GUCY1A3 or MOBP expression had significantly longer survival than patients with lower expression of these genes. After reviewing the literature, we selected the CBX3 gene for further experiments. We confirmed that CBX3 was overexpressed in glioblastoma by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays and qPCR analysis of surgical specimens. The functional assay results showed that silencing CBX3 arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, thereby weakening the cell proliferation ability.

This study investigated how glioblastomas induce reactive astrogliosis in the neighboring microenvironment and explore 11C-acetate PET as an imaging technique for detecting reactive astrogliosis. Methods: Through in vitro, mouse models, and human tissue experiments, we examined the association between elevated 11C-acetate uptake and reactive astrogliosis in gliomas. We explored acetate from glioblastoma cells, which triggers reactive astrogliosis in neighboring astrocytes by upregulating MAO-B and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression. We evaluated the presence of cancer stem cells in the reactive astrogliosis region of glioblastomas and assessed the correlation between the volume of 11C-acetate uptake beyond MRI and prognosis. Results: Elevated 11C-acetate uptake is associated with reactive astrogliosis and astrocytic MCT1 in the periphery of glioblastomas in human tissues and mouse models. Glioblastoma cells exhibit increased acetate production as a result of glucose metabolism, with subsequent secretion of acetate. Acetate derived from glioblastoma cells induces reactive astrogliosis in neighboring astrocytes by increasing the expression of MAO-B and MCT1. We found cancer stem cells within the reactive astrogliosis at the tumor periphery. Consequently, a larger volume of 11C-acetate uptake beyond contrast-enhanced MRI was associated with a worse prognosis.

"""Correlation of MR imaging-determined cerebral blood volume maps with histologic and angiographic determination of vascularity of gliomas.""","""Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the relationships between the ratio of maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) (rCBV ratio = rCBV[tumor]/rCBV[contralateral white matter]) and histologic and angiographic vascularities of gliomas using the gradient-echo echoplanar MR imaging technique. We also evaluated the usefulness of rCBV maps for grading gliomas. Subjects and methods: We examined 30 patients with histologically verified gliomas. Gliomas were classified as glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma with enhancement, anaplastic glioma without enhancement, and low-grade glioma. The maximum rCBV ratio of each glioma was compared with both histologic and angiographic vascularities, and the relationship between the maximum rCBV ratios and each type of glioma was established. Results: The maximum rCBV ratios of the gliomas significantly correlated with both histologic and angiographic vascularities (p < .001). Mean values and SDs of maximum rCBV ratios of each type of tumor were 7.32+/-4.39 for glioblastomas, 5.84+/-1.82 for anaplastic gliomas with enhancement, 1.53+/-0.75 for anaplastic gliomas without enhancement, and 1.26+/-0.55 for low-grade gliomas. The maximum rCBV ratios of the glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of the anaplastic gliomas without enhancement (p = .002) and the low-grade gliomas (p < .001). The maximum rCBV ratios of the anaplastic gliomas with enhancement were higher than those of the anaplastic gliomas without enhancement and the low-grade gliomas, but the differences were not statistically significant (p = .08 and p = .03, respectively). Conclusion: The results of perfusion-sensitive MR imaging with gradient-echo echoplanar technique correlated with both histologic and angiographic vascularities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9843274
"""Fractional anisotropy value by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging as a predictor of cell density and proliferation activity of glioblastomas.""","""Background: In vivo, water diffusion displays directionality due to presence of complex microstructural barriers in tissue. The extent of directionality of water diffusion can be expressed as a fractional anisotropy (FA) value using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI). The FA value has been suggested as an indicator of the cell density of astrocytic tumors. The aim of the present study was to confirm beyond doubt that FA values indicate cell density even when limited in glioblastomas and to determine whether the FA value of a given patient predicts proliferation activity in the individual glioblastoma. Methods: We performed DTI in 19 patients with glioblastoma and measured the FA values of tumor and normal brain regions prior to computed tomography-guided stereotactic biopsy. Differences in mean FA value between normal brain regions and glioblastoma lesion were compared. Cell density and MIB-1 indices were examined using tumor specimens obtained from biopsies. Correlation among FA values, cell density, and MIB-1 indices was also evaluated. Results: The mean FA value significantly differed between normal brain regions and glioblastoma lesions. Positive correlation was observed between FA value and cell density (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and between FA value and MIB-1 index (r = 0.80, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the FA value of glioblastoma as determined by DTI prior to surgery is a good predictor of cell density and, consequently, proliferation activity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15639528
"""Bevacizumab for glioblastoma: current indications, surgical implications, and future directions.""","""Initial enthusiasm after promising Phase II trials for treating recurrent glioblastomas with the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab—a neutralizing antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor—was tempered by recent Phase III trials showing no efficacy for treating newly diagnosed glioblastomas. As a result, there is uncertainty about the appropriate indications for the use of bevacizumab in glioblastoma treatment. There are also concerns about the effects of bevacizumab on wound healing that neurosurgeons must be aware of. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests a percentage of tumors treated with bevacizumab for an extended period of time will undergo transformation into a more biologically aggressive and invasive phenotype with a particularly poor prognosis. Despite these concerns, there remain numerous examples of radiological and clinical improvement after bevacizumab treatment, particularly in patients with recurrent glioblastoma with limited therapeutic options. In this paper, the authors review clinical results with bevacizumab for glioblastoma treatment to date, ongoing trials designed to address unanswered questions, current clinical indications based on existing data, neurosurgical implications of bevacizumab use in patients with glioblastoma, the current scientific understanding of the tumor response to short- and long-term bevacizumab treatment, and future studies that will need to be undertaken to enable this treatment to fulfill its therapeutic promise for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581938
"""Clinical outcome of concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant temozolomide therapy for glioblastaomas: single-center experience.""","""Introduction: The use of radiotherapy plus temozolomide administered concomitantly with and after radiotherapy for glioblastoma was recently shown to improve median and 2-year survival in a large international multicenter study. To compare this result in routine clinical practice, an audit of the management and outcome of patients with glioblastoma at our institute was performed. Methods: A total of 79 patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma were treated with radiotherapy (daily fractions of 2 Gy for a total of 60 Gy) combined with temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) per day, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), 5 consecutive days per month). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. We evaluated the clinical outcome of concomitant chemoradiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastomas at a single institute in Korea. Results: The median age was 52 years (15-76 years), 47 patients were male and 32 patients were female. 92.4% of the patients had undergone debulking surgery. The median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months (95% CI, 16.3-20.1 months), and the time to progression was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.2-8.3 months). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 70.1% and 37.1%, respectively. In the retrospective analysis, the patients with a post-operative KPS over 80 showed more prolonged survival than those who had a KPS less 80 (23.1 months vs. 13.4 months; p<0.001). Age and extent of surgery did not emerge as significant factors. Twenty-four patients (30%) were treated with low-dose continuous temozolomide therapy after the tumor had recurred. Hematologic toxicity was the main adverse effect, occurring in seven patients (8.8%). Patients with lymphopenia were not reported. Conclusions: This study is the largest study of radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma in Korean patients, who share a common genetic feature. The median and 2-year survival outcomes in this study are comparable to the previous reports. However, for the recurrent glioblastomas refractory to temozolomide, further clinical trials using other agents should be studied continuously in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19640635
"""Repurposing Disulfiram for Targeting of Glioblastoma Stem Cells: An In Vitro Study.""","""Mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation in glioblastoma that are responsible for therapy resistance and tumor spreading in the brain, reportedly upregulate aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform-1A3 (ALDH1A3) which can be inhibited by disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved drug formerly prescribed in alcohol use disorder. Reportedly, DSF in combination with Cu2+ ions exerts multiple tumoricidal, chemo- and radio-therapy-sensitizing effects in several tumor entities. The present study aimed to quantify these DSF effects in glioblastoma stem cells in vitro, regarding dependence on ALDH1A3 expression. To this end, two patient-derived GSC cultures with differing ALDH1A3 expression were pretreated (in the presence of CuSO4, 100 nM) with DSF (0 or 100 nM) and the DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide (0 or 30 µM) and then cells were irradiated with a single dose of 0-8 Gy. As read-outs, cell cycle distribution and clonogenic survival were determined by flow cytometry and limited dilution assay, respectively. As a result, DSF modulated cell cycle distribution in both GSC cultures and dramatically decreased clonogenic survival independently of ALDH1A3 expression. This effect was additive to the impairment of clonogenic survival by radiation, but not associated with radiosensitization. Of note, cotreatment with temozolomide blunted the DSF inhibition of clonogenic survival. In conclusion, DSF targets GSCs independent of ALDH1A3 expression, suggesting a therapeutic efficacy also in glioblastomas with low mesenchymal GSC populations. As temozolomide somehow antagonized the DSF effects, strategies for future combination of DSF with the adjuvant standard therapy (fractionated radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy followed by temozolomide maintenance therapy) are not supported by the present study.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34827559
"""CD133(+) and CD133(-) glioblastoma-derived cancer stem cells show differential growth characteristics and molecular profiles.""","""Although glioblastomas show the same histologic phenotype, biological hallmarks such as growth and differentiation properties vary considerably between individual cases. To investigate whether different subtypes of glioblastomas might originate from different cells of origin, we cultured tumor cells from 22 glioblastomas under medium conditions favoring the growth of neural and cancer stem cells (CSC). Secondary glioblastoma (n = 7)-derived cells did not show any growth in the medium used, suggesting the absence of neural stem cell-like tumor cells. In contrast, 11/15 primary glioblastomas contained a significant CD133(+) subpopulation that displayed neurosphere-like, nonadherent growth and asymmetrical cell divisions yielding cells expressing markers characteristic for all three neural lineages. Four of 15 cell lines derived from primary glioblastomas grew adherently in vitro and were driven by CD133(-) tumor cells that fulfilled stem cell criteria. Both subtypes were similarly tumorigenic in nude mice in vivo. Clinically, CD133(-) glioblastomas were characterized by a lower proliferation index, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was similar. GeneArray analysis revealed 117 genes to be differentially expressed by these two subtypes. Together, our data provide first evidence that CD133(+) CSC maintain only a subset of primary glioblastomas. The remainder stems from previously unknown CD133(-) tumor cells with apparent stem cell-like properties but distinct molecular profiles and growth characteristics in vitro and in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17483311
"""Primary cerebellar glioblastomas in children: clinical presentation and management.""","""Pediatric cerebellar glioblastomas (pcGBMs) are rare and their characteristics remain ill-defined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric cerebellar glioblastomas who underwent surgery from 2008 to 2019 in our department. Besides, we performed a literature review of the literature data on pcGBMs. Ten children with mean age of 9.4 years were included. During the follow-up, six patients died with mean survival time of 11.7 months, four patients survived with mean follow-up of 28 months. Seven patients underwent molecular analysis, no patients detected IDH1 mutations, four patients (57.1%) had H3K27M mutations, and two patients (28.6%) had MGMT promoter methylation. The literature review identified 38 pcGBMs cases (including ours), with mean age of 8.84 ± 4.20 years (range, 1-16 years). Increased ICP was the commonest sign. Eighteen (47.4%) patients underwent GTR and fifteen (45.5%) patients received STR. Postoperative radiation (RT) was conducted in 28 patients (75.7%) and 23 patients (65.7%) received chemotherapy. During the follow-up, 25 patients died with mean survival time of 12.21 months and 11 patients survived with average follow-up of 29.3 months. Kaplan-Meier survival depicted chemotherapy (P < 0.001) or radiation (P < 0.001) had positive impact on overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed chemotherapy was a significant predictor of survival with a hazard ratio of 3.264 (P = 0.038). Our study found mean overall survival time for pcGBMs patients was 12.21 months. PcGBMs may have distinct molecular features, with higher incidence of H3K27M mutation and were always IDH1 wild-type.

"""The Multipotential of Leucine-Rich alpha-2 Glycoprotein 1 as a Clinicopathological Biomarker of Glioblastoma.""","""Leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a diagnostic marker candidate for glioblastoma. Although LRG1 has been associated with angiogenesis, it has been suggested that its biomarker role differs depending on the type of tumor. In this study, a clinicopathological examination of LRG1's role as a biomarker for glioblastoma was performed. We used tumor tissues of 155 cases with diffuse gliomas (27 astrocytomas, 14 oligodendrogliomas, 114 glioblastomas). The immunohistochemical LRG1 intensity scoring was classified into 2 groups: low expression and high expression. Mutations of IDH1, IDH2, and TERT promoter were analyzed through the Sanger method. We examined the relationship between LRG1 expression level in glioblastoma and clinical parameters, such as age, preoperative Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, extent of resection, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter, and prognosis. LRG1 high expression rate was 41.2% in glioblastoma, 3.7% in astrocytoma, and 21.4% in oligodendroglioma. Glioblastoma showed a significantly higher LRG1 expression than lower-grade glioma (p = 0.0003). High expression of LRG1 was an independent favorable prognostic factor (p = 0.019) in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and correlated with gross total resection (p = 0.002) and the tumor location on nonsubventricular zone (p = 0.00007).

Experimental design: We screened primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a population-based study for IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation and correlated them with clinical data. Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 5 of 40 primary glioblastomas (12,5%). Primary GBM patients carrying IDH1 mutations were significantly younger, mean age of 41±5.06years, than patients with wild-type IDH1, mean age of 57±2,29years, p=0.011.

"""Genomic analysis of paired IDHwt glioblastomas reveals recurrent alterations of MPDZ at relapse after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.""","""Purpose: We aimed to identify genomic drivers of glioblastoma inevitable recurrence. Methods: Ten pairs of initial and recurrent frozen IDHwt glioblastoma samples were screened by CGH Array. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was then performed on an enriched cohort of 19 pairs. MPDZ alterations were analyzed using TCGA dataset. Results: Nineteen IDHwt glioblastoma patients were included. Median age was 54.5 y/o (37.2-72.8). Using CGH array, unsupervised analysis aggregated the cohort by paired initial and recurrent tumors. Only 44% of CGH Array alterations were conserved at recurrence (amplifications: 55%; deletions: 30%). Two regions (including FPR1, 2 and 3) were lost at relapse: 19q13.33 and 19q13.41. MPDZ and 25 other genes were altered in ≥20% of recurrent tumors. NGS analysis of 29 candidate genes revealed 4 genes with pathogenic mutations: (FPR2, REL, TYRP1 and MPDZ). MPDZ (Multiple PDZ Domain Crumbs Cell Polarity Complex Component) was altered by two pathogenic mutations occurring at relapse. Using TCGA dataset we observed that a lower MPDZ mRNA expression was associated with IDHwt (p < 0.001) and grade IV (p < 0.001) gliomas. Finally, a low mRNA MPDZ expression was significantly correlated to poor overall survival in both IDHwt and IDH mutated gliomas, reinforcing the potential pejorative impact of MPDZ loss. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MPDZ is more frequently altered at relapse after radio-chemotherapy in glioblastoma IDHwt patients, suggesting that MPDZ impairment could contribute to the systematic resistance of these tumors opening new therapeutic perspectives.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35259554

Survival was compared among 48 patients with glioblastoma according to assay results. Results: Only PSQ and MSP significantly separated patients who benefited from temozolomide, with PSQ being the superior method. For PSQ analysis, the cut-off value that best correlated with prognostic outcome was 7% methylation of MGMT. Median survival in patients with MGMT promoter methylation above this cut-off value was 7.8 months longer compared to those with less than 7% methylation.

To understand the intratumoral changes driving this phenomenon, we employed single-cell sequencing to analyze the differences between two pairs of primary and recurrent glioblastomas. Our findings revealed an upregulation of ferroptosis in endothelial cells within recurrent tumors, identified by the significant overexpression of the NOX4 gene. Further analysis indicated that knocking down NOX4 in endothelial cells reduced the activity of the ferroptosis pathway. Utilizing conditioned media from endothelial cells with lower ferroptosis activity, we observed a decrease in the growth rate of glioblastoma cells. These results highlighted the complex role of ferroptosis within tumors and suggested that targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of glioblastomas requires careful consideration of its effects on endothelial cells, as it may otherwise produce counterproductive outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38985083

To further address the role of NDRG2 as a candidate tumor suppressor in human gliomas, we analyzed 67 astrocytic tumors (10 diffuse astrocytomas, 11 anaplastic astrocytomas, 34 primary glioblastomas and 12 secondary glioblastomas) for NDRG2 gene mutation, promoter methylation and expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Using real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis, we found decreased NDRG2 mRNA levels in primary glioblastomas as compared to diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas. Similarly, immunohistochemistry revealed low or absent NDRG2 protein expression in primary glioblastomas. Mutational analysis of the entire NDRG2 coding sequence did not reveal any tumor-associated DNA sequence alterations. However, sequencing of sodium bisulfite-modified DNA identified hypermethylation of the NDRG2 promoter region in 21 of 34 primary glioblastomas (62%).

Against this background, we investigated a novel photoimmunotherapy approach combining the cytotoxicity of photodynamic therapy with the specificity of immunotherapy. An EGFR-specific affibody (ZEGFR:03115 ) was conjugated to the phthalocyanine dye, IR700DX, which when excited with near-infrared light produces a cytotoxic response. ZEGFR:03115 -IR700DX EGFR-specific binding was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The conjugate showed effective targeting of EGFR positive GBM cells in the brain. The therapeutic potential of the conjugate was assessed both in vitro, in GBM cell lines and spheroids by the CellTiter-Glo® assay, and in vivo using subcutaneous U87-MGvIII xenografts. In addition, mice were imaged pre- and post-PIT using the IVIS/Spectrum/CT to monitor treatment response. Binding of the conjugate correlated to the level of EGFR expression in GBM cell lines. The cell proliferation assay revealed a receptor-dependent response between the tested cell lines. Inhibition of EGFRvIII+ve tumor growth was observed following administration of the immunoconjugate and irradiation. Importantly, this response was not seen in control tumors.

Age and dexamethasone administration in glioblastoma patients have been hypothesized to limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy, but their effects remain unclear. We compared peripheral blood immune composition in patients with different types of brain tumor to determine the influence of age, dexamethasone treatment, and tumor volume. Methods: High-dimensional mass cytometry was used to characterise peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 169 patients with glioblastoma, lower grade astrocytoma, metastases and meningioma. We used blood from medically-refractory epilepsy patients and healthy controls as control groups. Immune phenotyping was performed using FlowSOM and t-SNE analysis in R followed by supervised annotation of the resulting clusters. We conducted multiple linear regression analysis between intracranial pathology and cell type abundance, corrected for clinical variables. We tested correlations between cell type abundance and survival with Cox-regression analyses. Results: Glioblastoma patients had significantly fewer naive CD4+ T cells, but higher percentages of mature NK cells than controls. Decreases of naive CD8+ T cells and alternative monocytes and an increase of memory B cells in glioblastoma patients were influenced by age and dexamethasone treatment, and only memory B cells by tumor volume. Progression free survival was associated with percentages of CD4+ regulatory T cells and double negative T cells. Conclusion: High-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood in patients with different types of intracranial tumor provides insight into the relation between intracranial pathology and peripheral immune status.

Patients receive surgery and chemoradiotherapy but tumors almost always fatally recur. Results: Using RNA sequencing data from 107 pairs of pre- and post-standard treatment locally recurrent IDHwt GBM tumors, we identify two responder subtypes based on longitudinal changes in gene expression. In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. Conclusions: We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment.

Results: Univariate analysis showed that patients with fractional anisotropy (FA)(mean) ≤ 0.2, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)(min) ≤ 0.6, planar anisotropy (CP)(min) ≤ 0.002, spherical anisotropy (CS)(mean) > 0.68 and Ki-67 > 0.3 had lower PFS rate. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that only CP(min) was the best predictor of survival in these patients, after adjusting for age, Karnofsky performance scale and extent of resection. No significant correlation between DTI metrics and Ki-67 were observed. Conclusion: DTI metrics can be used as a sensitive and early indicator for PFS in patients with glioblastomas. This could be useful for treatment planning as high-grade gliomas with lower ADC(min), FA(mean), CP(min), and higher CS(mean) values may be treated more aggressively.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882608

"""Glioblastoma oncometry.""","""A prospective study of 20 patients was conducted to determine changes in the computed tomography appearance of glioblastomas seen at the completion of radiation therapy. An interval CT was obtained after 4000 to 4500 cGy to the whole brain and was compared to a similar baseline study. The tumor volume increased in twelve patients by 13 to 878% (mean 126%) and decreased in seven by 13 to 73% (mean 37%). It remained unchanged in one patient. A broadening or thinning of the enhancing rim frequently accompanied the increased or decreased tumor, respectively. Volume change immediately after whole brain radiotherapy was no prognostic indicator. The volume increase seen in 60% of the patients had implications for treatment planning of the boost field. It translated into a potential field size increase of up to 5.6 cm (mean 3.5 cm) and could contribute to a geographic miss. It is concluded that following whole brain radiation therapy, a repeat CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging, depending on the initial exam, is necessary for optimal planning of the reduced radiation field.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2176356

The level of MDM2 gene amplification (high versus low) may allow selection of patients for cancer treatment with MDM2 inhibitors and may predict their responsiveness. We investigated the spectrum of MDM2 gene alterations using the new probes in vivo after visualizing single neoplastic cells in situ from a series of glioblastomas. Signals from next-generation repeat-free FISH interphase probes were identified in tissue microarrays that included 3 spots for each of the 48 cases. The murine double minutes (MDM2)-specific DNA probe and the satellite enumeration probe for chromosome 12 were used. Three cases (6%) showed more than 25 signals (high gene amplification), and 7 (15%) showed 3-10 signals (gains); among these, 4 cases (8%) had an equal number of MDM2 and centromeric signals on chromosome 12 (polyploidy). Genomic heterogeneity was observed only in 3 cases with low gene amplification. In our series, 6% of glioblastomas exhibited high MDM2 amplification (in vivo) with a pattern related to the known double minutes/chromothripsis phenomenon (in situ), and only cases with low amplification showed genomic heterogeneity. We concluded that the rate of MDM2 gene amplification can be a useful predictive biomarker to improve patient selection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28212808
"""End-to-end workflow for finite element analysis of tumor treating fields in glioblastomas.""","""Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is an approved modality of treatment for glioblastoma. Patient anatomy-based finite element analysis (FEA) has the potential to reveal not only how these fields affect tumor control but also how to improve efficacy. While the automated tools for segmentation speed up the generation of FEA models, multi-step manual corrections are required, including removal of disconnected voxels, incorporation of unsegmented structures and the addition of 36 electrodes plus gel layers matching the TTFields transducers. Existing approaches are also not scalable for the high throughput analysis of large patient volumes. A semi-automated workflow was developed to prepare FEA models for TTFields mapping in the human brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-processing, segmentation, electrode and gel placement, and post-processing were all automated. The material properties of each tissue were applied to their corresponding mask in silico using COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL, Burlington, MA, USA). The fidelity of the segmentations with and without post-processing was compared against the full semi-automated segmentation workflow approach using Dice coefficient analysis. The average relative differences for the electric fields generated by COMSOL were calculated in addition to observed differences in electric field-volume histograms. Furthermore, the mesh file formats in MPHTXT and NASTRAN were also compared using the differences in the electric field-volume histogram. The Dice coefficient was less for auto-segmentation without versus auto-segmentation with post-processing, indicating convergence on a manually corrected model. An existent but marginal relative difference of electric field maps from models with manual correction versus those without was identified, and a clear advantage of using the NASTRAN mesh file format was found. The software and workflow outlined in this article may be used to accelerate the investigation of TTFields in glioblastoma patients by facilitating the creation of FEA models derived from patient MRI datasets.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29023236
"""Perillyl alcohol induces apoptosis in human glioblastoma multiforme cells.""","""Standard treatment of glioblastoma multiforme consisting of surgical resection, radiation and/or chemotherapy is rarely curative, emphasizing the need for new chemotherapeutic drugs. The monoterpene perillyl alcohol (POH) has preventive and therapeutic effects in a wide variety of pre-clinical tumor models and is currently under phase I and II clinical trials. In the present study, we analyzed its effect on human glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and A172) and a primary cell culture derived from a human glioblastoma tumor specimen (GBM-1). Using MTT, we showed that POH inhibits the viability of glioblastomas in a concentration-dependent way. Glioblastoma cell lines treated with POH showed morphological alterations characteristic of apoptosis. Analysis of cell cycle and quantification of DNA fragmentation, in cells stained with propidium iodide (PI), confirmed the apoptotic effect of POH on glioblastomas.

The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Methods: In an observational, retrospective, single-center study, the authors examined the medical records of 976 adults newly diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype between January 2000 and January 2021. They analyzed clinical-, imaging-, and treatment-related factors associated with 2-year and 5-year survival. Results: The median overall survival was 11.2 months (12.2 months for patients included after 2005 and the introduction of standard combined chemoradiotherapy). The median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (10.0 months for patients included after 2005). Overall, 17.6% of patients reached a 2-year overall survival, while 2.2% of patients reached a 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, 6.6% of patients survived 2 years without progression, while 1.1% of patients survived 5 years without progression. Two factors that were consistently associated with 2-year and 5-year survival were first-line oncological treatment with standard combined chemoradiotherapy and methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter. Other factors that were significantly associated with 2-year or 5-year survival were age at diagnosis ≤ 60 years, headaches or signs of raised intracranial pressure at diagnosis, cortical contact of contrast enhancement, no contrast enhancement crossing the midline on initial imaging, total or subtotal tumor resection, and a second line of oncological treatment at recurrence. Within 21 cases of 5-year survival, 18 were confirmed to be glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype, and 7 of the 5-year survivors (38.9%) had additional genetic alterations: 3 cases had an FGFR mutation or fusion, 3 cases had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 case had a PTPN11 mutation, and 1 case had a PMS2 mutation in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome. Conclusions: Five-year overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is extremely low. Predictors of a longer survival are mostly treatment factors, emphasizing the importance of a complete oncological treatment plan, when achievable.

"""The histological representativeness of glioblastoma tissue samples.""","""Background: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are known for having a vastly heterogenous histopathology. Several studies have shown that GBMs can be histologically undergraded due to sampling errors of small tissue samples. We sought to explore to what extent histological features in GBMs are dependent on the amount of viable tissue on routine slides from both biopsied and resected tumors. Methods: In 106 newly diagnosed GBM patients, we investigated associations between the presence or degree of 24 histopathological and two immunohistochemical features and the tissue amount on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides. The amount of viable tissue was semiquantitatively categorized as 'sparse,' 'medium,' or 'substantial' for each case. Tissue amount was also assessed for associations with MRI volumetrics and the type of surgical procedure. Results: About half (46%) of the assessed histological and immunohistochemical features were significantly associated with tissue amount. The significant features were less present or of a lesser degree when the tissue amount was smaller. Among the significant features were most of the features relevant for diffuse astrocytic tumor grading, i.e., small necroses, palisades, microvascular proliferation, atypia, mitotic count, and Ki-67/MIB-1 proliferative index (PI). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of the assessed histological features were at risk of being underrepresented when the amount of viable tissue on HE slides was limited. Most of the grading features were dependent on tissue amount, which underlines the importance of considering sampling errors in diffuse astrocytic tumor grading. Our findings also highlight the importance of adequate tissue collection to increase the quality of diagnostics and histological research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33085022
"""Treatment considerations for MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma.""","""Prognosis for patients with glioblastoma continues to be limited, despite an aggressive, multimodal treatment including alkylating chemotherapy. Temozolomide, the most widely used alkylating agent in glioblastoma, is cytotoxic to cells by inducing DNA damage but can be rapidly repaired by the protein O (6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In a subset of glioblastomas, the MGMT promoter is methylated, impairing the repair mechanism and conferring chemosensitivity. However, MGMT is overexpressed in 60 % of glioblastomas providing an inherent resistance to alkylating agents and challenging the role of temozolomide in this population. This article reviews the data establishing MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic factor in glioblastoma and its potential role as a predictor of temozolomide response. It focuses on results from recent studies in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and the role of temozolomide in MGMT-unmethylated patients.

"""Chromatin accessibility analysis identifies GSTM1 as a prognostic marker in human glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant human brain tumor that has an extremely poor prognosis. Classic mutations such as IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) alternations, and MGMT (O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase) promoter hypermethylation have been used to stratify patients and provide prognostic significance. Epigenetic perturbations have been demonstrated in glioblastoma tumorigenesis. Despite the genetic markers used in the management of glioblastoma patients, new biomarkers that could predict patient survival independent of known biomarkers remain to be identified. Methods: ATAC-seq (assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing) and RNA-seq have been used to profile chromatin accessible regions using glioblastoma patient samples with short-survival versus long-survival. Cell viability, cell cycle, and Western blot analysis were used to characterize the cellular phenotypes and identify signaling pathways. Results: Analysis of chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq coupled with RNA-seq methods identified the GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase mu-1) gene, which featured higher chromatin accessibility in GBM tumors with short survival. GSTM1 was confirmed to be a significant prognostic marker to predict survival using a different GBM patient cohort. Knockdown of GSTM1 decreased cell viability, caused cell cycle arrest, and decreased the phosphorylation levels of the NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) p65 subunit and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) (pSer727). Conclusions: This report demonstrates the use of ATAC-seq coupled with RNA-seq to identify GSTM1 as a prognostic marker of GBM patient survival. Activation of phosphorylation levels of NF-kB p65 and STAT3 (pSer727) by GSTM1 is shown.

Additionally, we performed O6-methylguanin-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation analysis using real-time methylation-specific PCR in 36 patients with glioblastoma, and the prognostic significance of these biomarkers in glioblastomas was evaluated. Results: Overexpression of CD151 was observed in a significant proportion (55.6%) of glioblastomas, while CD151 was rarely overexpressed in most of grade I to III glial tumors. CD151 overexpression was closely associated with MGMT methylation (P = 0.014), and it was a prognostic factor for predicting worse overall survival (OS; P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.043). We also found that combination of CD151 overexpression and MGMT methylation better stratified the patients' OS (P = 0.001) and PFS (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, CD151 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS over MGMT methylation (P = 0.012). Conclusions: CD151 seems to have a critical role for high-grade progression in astroglial tumors.

"""Loss of heterozygosity at 11p15 and p53 alterations in malignant gliomas.""","""Purpose: Malignant gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors. Recent studies defined several genetic markers, which might characterize molecular-biological subsets of glioblastomas with prognostic implications. In the later steps of tumor-progression, deletions on chromosome 11p15 and mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 were determined for different malignancies. To elucidate the involvement of 11p15 deletions in the tumorigenesis of malignant gliomas, we analyzed a series of 50 glioblastomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Methods: Paired tissue and blood samples from 50 patients with glioblastoma multiforme were included. Microsatellite markers located on 11p15.1-11p15.5 were used for LOH analysis. Additionally, mutation analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p53 was performed, which might correlate with favorable survival in glioblastomas. Results: The region 11p15.4-5 was deleted heterozygously in 28% of cases representing 15 cM. Twenty-six glioblastomas did not show allelic loss for any locus. Our data revealed close association of LOH 11p15 with p53 mutations, and survival analysis showed a trend indicating better prognosis in glioblastomas characterized by LOH 11p15.

"""Organotypic distribution of stem cell markers in formalin-fixed brain harboring glioblastoma multiforme.""","""The role of stem cells in the origin, growth patterns, and infiltration of glioblastoma multiforme is a subject of intense investigation. One possibility is that glioblastoma may arise from transformed stem cells in the ventricular zone. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of two stem cell markers, activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) and CD133, in an autopsy brain specimen from an individual with glioblastoma multiforme. A 41-year-old male with a right posterior temporal glioblastoma had undergone surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The brain was harvested within several hours after death. After formalin fixation, sectioning, and mapping of tumor location in the gross specimen, histologic specimens were prepared from tumor-bearing and grossly normal hemispheres. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry and colorimetric staining were performed for ATF5 and CD133. Both markers co-localized to the ependymal and subependymal zones on the side of the tumor, but not in the normal hemisphere or more rostrally in the affected hemisphere. ATF5 staining was especially robust within the diseased hemisphere in histologically normal ependyma. To our knowledge, this is the first in situ demonstration of stem cell markers in whole human brain. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that some glioblastomas may arise from the neurogenic zone of the lateral ventricle. The robust staining for ATF5 and CD133 in histologically normal ventricular zone suggests that an increase in periventricular stem cell activity occurred in this patient on the side of the tumor, either as a localized response to brain injury or as an integral component of oncogenesis and tumor recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17516028

Specifically, the age incidence distribution, sex ratio, and the postoperative survivals were studied. The Registry also provided the opportunity to define the relative racial frequencies of this neoplasm in a large biracial population. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 58.6 years and the age group having the highest incidence was 60 to 74 years. The overall ratio of affected males to females was 1.04 to 1. The postoperative survival periods were considerably shorter than those reported from large cooperative clinical trials. The overall postoperative survivals at 12 and 24 months were only 22% and 4%, respectively. Advancing age had a strong negative relationship with the length of survival such that the 50% survival for patients less than 30 years of age was 17 months, for those age 30 to 44 years it was 10.2 months, for those age 45 to 59 it was 5.8 months, and for those older than 60 it was only 2.2 months.

"""Necrosis and glioblastoma: a friend or a foe? A review and a hypothesis.""","""Objective: Two main forms of cell death are encountered in biology: apoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) and necrosis (i.e., accidental cell death). Because necrosis and apoptosis can lead to cell removal, one might intuit that they are both desirable in cancer treatment. However, in the setting of glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant brain tumor for which the presence of necrosis is an important diagnostic feature, clinical studies indicate that as the degree of necrosis advances, the patient's prognosis worsens. Despite the apparent importance of this form of cell death, the mechanism of development of necrosis in glioblastomas remains unelucidated. The purpose of this article is to try to resolve this dilemma by hypothesizing the mechanism of necrosis formation in these tumors. Methods: On the basis of an extensive review of the literature, we present a hypothesis for the mechanism of necrosis formation in glioblastoma multiforme. Results: One of the many possible pathways leading to necrosis formation may involve increased tumor cell secretion of tumor necrosis factor. Procoagulation and antiapoptotic mechanisms resulting from certain pathways could prevent the completion of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis and could promote necrosis as the final mode of cell death. Such a hypothesis would explain the inverse correlation that exists between tumor necrosis and the survival of patients with glioblastomas, because the hypoxia that results from procoagulation selects for tumor cells that are more aggressive and more resistant to apoptosis-inducing therapies. Conclusion: A complete understanding of the series of events surrounding necrosis development in glioblastomas that is evidence-based is likely to provide targets for future therapies. On the basis of the potential mechanisms of development of necrosis described in this article, we postulate that effective therapies may have to be directed against the pathways that result in the formation of necrosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12182418

We report 10 examples: 8 epithelioid glioblastomas (E-GBMs) and 2 rhabdoid GBMs (R-GBMs). E-GBMs tended to be superficially located, circumscribed, supratentorial tumors composed of monotonous, discohesive sheets of small rounded cells that mimicked metastatic malignant melanoma. R-GBMs showed tumor with classic rhabdoid features arising as a subpopulation of an otherwise classic GBM, fitting the definition of composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumors. Polyphenotypic immunohistochemical expression and focal loss of INI-1 protein in the rhabdoid areas of R-GBMs distinguished them from E-GBMs. Monosomy 22 was identified in R-GBMs, but not E-GBMs. Immunostaining for claudin-6, a key component of tight junctions that we have earlier shown to be a positive cytoplasmic immunohistochemical marker for atypical teratoid or rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), was also conducted. None of the E-GBMs or R-GBMs showed claudin-6 cytoplasmic expression, including the focal areas in the 2 R-GBMs in which there was loss of INI-1 protein nuclear expression. Thus, in the CNS, claudin-6 expression may be a good discriminator of atypical teratoid or rhabdoid tumors from other CNS rhabdoid or epithelioid neoplasms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20118769

In addition, PROX1 has been ascribed suppressive as well as oncogenic roles in several human cancers, including brain tumors. In this study we explored the correlation between PROX1 expression and patient survival in high-grade astrocytomas. For this purpose, we analyzed protein expression in tissue microarrays of tumor samples stratified by patient age and IDH mutation status. We initially screened 86 unselected high-grade astrocytomas, followed by 174 IDH1-R132H1 immunonegative glioblastomas derived from patients aged 60 years and older enrolled in the Nordic phase III trial of elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Representing the younger population of glioblastomas, we studied 80 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas from patients aged 18-60 years. There was no correlation between PROX1 protein and survival for patients with primary glioblastomas included in these cohorts. In contrast, high expression of PROX1 protein predicted shorter survival in the group of patients with IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas. The prognostic impact of PROX1 in IDH-mutant 1p19q non-codeleted high-grade astrocytomas, as well as the negative findings in primary glioblastomas, was corroborated by gene expression data extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas.

Unfortunately acquired TMZ resistance severely undermines its clinical efficacy. Using an in vitro model, we tested whether poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and -2 (PARP) inhibition could suppress the emergence of resistance to enhance the effectiveness of TMZ. Methods: Using the MGMT-methylated GBM line U251N, in which TMZ resistance can be induced, we developed a method to rapidly recreate mechanisms of TMZ resistance seen in GBMs, including MMR mutations and MGMT re-expression. We then assessed whether TMZ resistant U251N sub-clones could be re-sensitized to TMZ by co-treatment with the PARP inhibitor ABT-888, and also whether the emergence of resistance could be suppressed by PARP inhibition. Results: U251N cultures chronically exposed to TMZ developed discrete colonies that expanded during TMZ treatment. These colonies were isolated, expanded further as sub-clones, and assessed for mechanisms of TMZ resistance. Most resistant sub-clones had detectable mutations in one or more mismatch repair (MMR) genes, frequently MSH6, and displayed infrequent re-expression of MGMT. TMZ resistance was associated with isolated poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) up-regulation in one sub-clone and was unexplained in several others. TMZ resistant sub-clones regressed during co-treatment with TMZ and ABT-888, and early co-treatment of U251N parental cultures suppressed the emergence of TMZ resistant colonies. Conclusion: In a model of acquired resistance, co-treatment with TMZ and a PARP inhibitor had two important benefits: re-sensitization of TMZ resistant cells and suppression of TMZ resistance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32562246

Seventy-six glial tumors including 44 glioblastomas with known survival time, 18 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs), six diffuse astrocytomas (DAs), and eight pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) were examined immunohistochemically for fascin expression. Fascin was observed in the neurons of normal brain tissue and endothelium of vascular spaces in the glial tumors. Fascin expression was correlated with histologic grade in DAs. PAs expressed low levels of fascin. Half of the GBs showed high levels of fascin expression. In the GB group, overall survival was poor for cases with percentage of stained cells >50% having moderate or strong staining intensity. In GBs, overall survival was also poor for >50-year-old cases and cases that refused radiotherapy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age (>50 years, P=0.021) and higher level of fascin expression (immunohistochemical score >8, P=0.040) were independent poor prognostic factors.

Primary and recurrent glioblastoma samples from 18 patients were identified and expression profiling of 770 myeloid innate immune-related markers was performed. Leukemia inhibitory factor and pentraxin 3 were expressed at lower levels in recurrent tumors. Using in silico data and immunohistochemical staining, this was validated for pentraxin 3. Both high leukemia inhibitory factor and pentraxin 3 expression appeared to be associated with shorter survival in primary and recurrent GBM using in silico data. In primary GBM, gene set analysis also showed higher expression of genes involved in metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and complement activation, whereas genes involved in T cell activation and checkpoint signaling were expressed at higher levels in recurrent GBM. The reduced level of pentraxin 3 in recurrent glioblastomas and the gene set analysis results suggest an altered microenvironment in recurrent GBM that might be more active.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791527
"""Genetic profile of astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas.""","""Low-grade diffuse gliomas WHO grade II (diffuse astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma) are characterized by frequent IDH1/2 mutations (>80%) that occur at a very early stage. In addition, the majority of diffuse astrocytomas (about 60%) carry TP53 mutations, which constitute a prognostic marker for shorter survival. Oligodendrogliomas show frequent loss at 1p/19q (about 70% of cases), which is associated with longer survival. With respect to clinical outcome, molecular classification on the basis of IDH1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, and 1p/19q loss showed a predictive power similar to histological classification. IDH1/2 mutations are frequent (>80%) in secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas with IDH1/2 mutations are very rare (<5%); they show an age distribution and genetic profile similar to secondary glioblastomas and are probably misclassified. Using the presence of IDH1/2 mutations as a diagnostic criterion, secondary glioblastomas account for approximately 10% of all glioblastomas. IDH1/2 mutations are the most significant predictor of favorable outcome of glioblastoma patients. The high frequency of IDH1/2 mutations in oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and secondary glioblastomas derived thereof suggests these tumors share a common progenitor cell population. The absence of this molecular marker in primary glioblastomas suggests a different cell of origin; both glioblastoma subtypes acquire a similar histological phenotype as a result of common genetic alterations, including the loss of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 10q.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21442241
"""Comparative analysis of molecular and histological glioblastomas: insights into prognostic variance.""","""Purpose: Whether molecular glioblastomas (GBMs) identify with a similar dismal prognosis as a 'classical' histological GBM is controversial. This study aimed to compare the clinical, molecular, imaging, surgical factors, and prognosis between molecular GBMs and histological GBMs. Methods: Retrospective chart and imaging review was performed in 983 IDH-wildtype GBM patients (52 molecular GBMs and 931 histological GBMs) from a single institution between 2005 and 2023. Propensity score-matched analysis was additionally performed to adjust for differences in baseline variables between molecular GBMs and histological GBMs. Results: Molecular GBM patients were substantially younger (58.1 vs. 62.4, P = 0.014) with higher rate of TERTp mutation (84.6% vs. 50.3%, P < 0.001) compared with histological GBM patients. Imaging showed higher incidence of gliomatosis cerebri pattern (32.7% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001) in molecular GBM compared with histological GBM, which resulted in lesser extent of resection (P < 0.001) in these patients. The survival was significantly better in molecular GBM compared to histological GBM (median OS 30.2 vs. 18.4 months, P = 0.001). The superior outcome was confirmed in propensity score analyses by matching histological GBM to molecular GBM (P < 0.001). Conclusion: There are distinct clinical, molecular, and imaging differences between molecular GBMs and histological GBMs. Our results suggest that molecular GBMs have a more favorable prognosis than histological GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39115615

METHODS The authors describe their experience, in which SLA for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment was performed entirely within a conventional MRI suite using the SmartFrame stereotactic device. RESULTS All 10 patients with GBM (2 with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation [mIDH1] and 8 with wild-type IDH1 [wtIDH1]) were followed for > 6 months. One of these patients underwent 2 independent SLAs approximately 12 months apart. Biopsies were performed prior to SLA for all patients. There were no perioperative morbidities, wound infections, or unplanned 30-day readmissions. The average time for a 3-trajectory SLA (n = 3) was 436 ± 102 minutes; for a 2-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 321 ± 85 minutes; and for a single-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 254 ± 28 minutes. No tumor recurrence occurred within the blue isotherm line ablation zone, although 2 patients experienced recurrence immediately adjacent to the blue isotherm ablation line. Overall survival for the patient cohort averaged 356 days, with the 2 patients who had mIDH1 GBMs exhibiting the longest survival (811 and 654 days). CONCLUSIONS Multitrajectory SLA for treatment of GBM can be safely performed using the SmartFrame stereotactic device in a conventional MRI suite.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27690648
"""Quantitative evaluation of nucleolar features on cytologic material in brain tumor diagnosis.""","""Nucleolar-related features were quantified in toluidin blue-stained smears from 36 brain tumors in order to improve our knowledge of the nucleolar frequency, size and margination. It was observed that low-grade astrocytic tumors had high percentages of nucleolated cells but the nucleoli were mostly single with maximum nucleolar diameter smaller than 2.00 microns. The percentages of marginated nucleoli were also low, ranging between 3.00% and 30.00% (only one case had a higher percentage). The high-grade tumors, i.e. anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, did not significantly differ from low-grade astrocytomas in their percentages of nucleolated nuclei, but they showed a higher number of nuclei having three or more nucleoli and the mean nucleolar diameter was in general bigger than 2.00 microns. Glioblastomas had marginated nucleoli much more frequently than anaplastic astrocytomas, the percentage in all but one case being higher than 30.00%. The percentage of marginated nucleoli was much higher in glioblastomas than in metastases, while the nucleoli were bigger in the latter group. A wide range of values for most of the nucleolar-associated parameters was observed in the remaining non-astrocytic brain tumors. Our results, showing differences in nuclear number, size and margination in different brain tumors, lead us to consider it worthwhile to investigate nucleolar-related features and their relationships using a quantitative approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7851047
"""Low expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in glioblastoma predicts longer patient survival.""","""In colorectal cancer and breast cancer a high TIMP-1 level has been shown to correlate with a shorter overall patient survival and it has been suggested that TIMP-1 is involved in tumour invasion, proliferation and apoptosis in different types of cancers. TIMP-1 is known to be expressed in gliomas but whether TIMP-1 is a prognostic marker in gliomas has not previously been investigated. In the present study, the TIMP-1 expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 112 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded astrocytomas and related to tumour grade and overall patient survival by scoring the TIMP-1 immunoreactivity of both tumour cells and blood vessels. Moreover, TIMP-1 in situ hybridisation was performed on ten of the glioblastomas. In the vast majority of the tumours TIMP-1 protein was expressed in both tumour cells and blood vessels. In situ hybridisation for TIMP-1 mRNA on glioblastomas confirmed the immunohistochemical expression of TIMP-1. The percentage of TIMP-1 positive tumour cells and blood vessels as well as the staining intensity varied between tumours of the same grade, but the total staining score increased with tumour grade. The multivariate Cox regression test showed that glioblastoma patients with the lowest TIMP-1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (HR (95% CI) = 3.2 (1.5-6.7), P = 0.004) when compared to the patients with higher TIMP-1 protein expression. In conclusion, this study showed that low TIMP-1 immunohistochemical expression predicts longer overall survival in glioblastoma patients, suggesting a role for TIMP-1 as a biomarker in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19430729
"""Subependymal spread of recurrent glioblastoma detected with the intraoperative use of 5-aminolevulinic acid: case report.""","""Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) can occur locally or at distant sites within the brain. Though MRI is the standard imaging modality for primary and recurrent GBM, the full extent of diffuse lesions may not be appreciated on MRI alone. Glioblastomas with ependymal and/or subependymal spread are examples of diffuse infiltrative tumors that are incompletely seen on MRI. Some other adjuvant visualization technique such as intraoperative fluorescence-assisted 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) could be used to assist the surgeon in localizing the infiltrating tumor. The authors report on a 56-year-old man who presented 7 years after initial resection of an occipital lobe GBM with imaging consistent with distant discrete foci of tumor recurrence. Because these foci were distant from the original resection cavity, there was concern for diffuse, infiltrative tumor elsewhere throughout the brain versus a distant multicentric recurrence. Therefore, the patient was given 5-ALA prior to surgery to aid in tumor detection intraoperatively. Using fluorescent visualization of the resection cavity, it was confirmed that there was subependymal and ependymal spread of the recurrent tumor along the lateral ventricle connecting the recurrence to the previous tumor site. Magnetic resonance imaging may not completely detect the presence of diffuse tumor infiltrating the ependymal or subependymal spaces. Therefore, adjunct intraoperative use of fluorescence-assisted visualization with 5-ALA may be helpful in highlighting and detecting infiltrative tumor to accurately detect tumor burden and distinguish it from a separate multicentric recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23421452
"""Primary human glioblastomas - prognostic value of clinical and histopathological parameters.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant human brain tumor with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of GBM is based on histological features, however, few studies have evaluated their prognostic relevance in light of the latest WHO classification of 2007. Aim: In this study we have evaluated the prognostic value of several clinical and histological characteristics encountered in human GBMs according to the WHO 2007 criteria. Material and methods: 199 patients with primary GBM consecutively operated and histologically reviewed according to the 2007 WHO scheme, were included. Several clinical and histological features were recorded and related to survival. Results: Mean age of the GBM patients at diagnosis was 62 years (range 21 - 84). Male/female ratio was 1.3/1, and the median survival was 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.1 - 9.0 months). In a multivariate COX analysis age, WHO performance score, subcortical localization, extent of surgery, radiation treatment, chemotherapy, and the presence of large necrosis had individual effect on overall survival (p < 0.05). In addition, females, tumors with angiocentric growth, with pseudopalisades, or without lymphocyte infiltration were related to shorter survival in univariate analyses (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings confirm the strong prognostic value of age, treatment, performance score, and localization for glioblastoma patients.

"""Impact of the methylation classifier and ancillary methods on CNS tumor diagnostics.""","""Background: Accurate CNS tumor diagnosis can be challenging, and methylation profiling can serve as an adjunct to classify diagnostically difficult cases. Methods: An integrated diagnostic approach was employed for a consecutive series of 1258 surgical neuropathology samples obtained primarily in a consultation practice over 2-year period. DNA methylation profiling and classification using the DKFZ/Heidelberg CNS tumor classifier was performed, as well as unsupervised analyses of methylation data. Ancillary testing, where relevant, was performed. Results: Among the received cases in consultation, a high-confidence methylation classifier score (>0.84) was reached in 66.4% of cases. The classifier impacted the diagnosis in 46.7% of these high-confidence classifier score cases, including a substantially new diagnosis in 26.9% cases. Among the 289 cases received with only a descriptive diagnosis, methylation was able to resolve approximately half (144, 49.8%) with high-confidence scores. Additional methods were able to resolve diagnostic uncertainty in 41.6% of the low-score cases. Tumor purity was significantly associated with classifier score (P = 1.15e-11). Deconvolution demonstrated that suspected glioblastomas (GBMs) matching as control/inflammatory brain tissue could be resolved into GBM methylation profiles, which provided a proof-of-concept approach to resolve tumor classification in the setting of low tumor purity. Conclusions: This work assesses the impact of a methylation classifier and additional methods in a consultative practice by defining the proportions with concordant vs change in diagnosis in a set of diagnostically challenging CNS tumors. We address approaches to low-confidence scores and confounding issues of low tumor purity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34555175

However, despite the apparent advantages of the sRRV, improvements in the in vivo transduction efficiency are still required to deliver therapeutic genes efficiently for clinical use. In this study, we established a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelopepseudotyped semi-replication-competent retrovirus vector system (spRRV) which is composed of two transcomplementing replication-defective retroviral vectors termed MuLV-Gag-Pol and GaLV-Env. We found that the spRRV shows considerable improvement in efficiencies of gene transfer and spreading in both human glioblastoma cells and pre-established human glioblastoma mouse model compared with an sRRV system. When treated with ganciclovir after intratumoral injection of each vector system into pre-established U-87 MG glioblastomas, the group of mice injected with spRRV expressing the herpes simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene showed a survival rate of 100% for more than 150 days, but all control groups of mice (HSV1-tk/PBS-treated and GFP/GCV-treated groups) died within 45 days after tumor injection.

Although internationally accepted WHO grading system of CNS tumours is based on histological features of H&E stained sections, yet there are cases where differentiation between grade II and grade III is difficult particularly when the biopsy is small. Proliferative index derived from MIB-1 immunostaining has been found to be useful in the distinction between various grades of malignancy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 90 cases of astrocytic tumours, 30 each of low-grade astrocytoma (grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III), and glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV), were immunostained by standard indirect immunoperoxidase technique using MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. MIB-1 labeling index (MIB-1 LI) was calculated. The mean MIB-1 LI values of astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas were 1.75 +/- 1.5%, 8.74 +/- 6.2%, and 20.54 +/- 12.2% respectively and there was statistically significant difference between grade II and III (Unpaired 't' test, T value 5.907, p value < 0.001) and grade III and grade IV (T value 4.734, p value < 0.001). The statistical analysis also revealed that the mean MIB-1 LI increased with histological grade of malignancy (One way ANOVA test, p value < 0.001).

CGH demonstrated that the most frequent region of gain was at chromosome 7p, whereas the most frequent losses occurred at chromosomes 10q and 13q. Losses at chromosome 10 were found in 36% of patients, and PTEN was mutated in 27% of the 22 GBMs, including 4 point mutations and 2 homozygous deletions. The possible therapeutic role of PTEN in GBM was also studied in a system based on retroviral infection of the GBM cell line A172, homozygously deleted at the PTEN locus. A172 growth and proliferation rate were reduced by 50% after PTEN transduction. Moreover, we showed that inhibition of cell growth occurred through the PI3K/Akt/p27 pathway.

"""Immunohistochemical analysis-based proteomic subclassification of newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Recent gene expression and copy number profilings of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of this tumor. However, these approaches might not be easily applicable in routine clinical practice. In the current study, we aimed to establish a proteomics-based subclassification of GBM by integrating their genomic and epigenomic profiles. We subclassified 79 newly diagnosed GBM based on expression patterns determined by comprehensive immunohistochemical observation in combination with their DNA copy number and DNA methylation patterns. The clinical relevance of our classification was independently validated in TCGA datasets. Consensus clustering identified the four distinct GBM subtypes: Oligodendrocyte Precursor (OPC) type, Differentiated Oligodendrocyte (DOC) type, Astrocytic Mesenchymal (AsMes) type and Mixed type. The OPC type was characterized by highly positive scores of Olig2, PDGFRA, p16, p53 and synaptophysin. In contrast, the AsMes type was strongly associated with strong expressions of nestin, CD44 and podoplanin, with a high glial fibrillary acidic protein score. The median overall survival of OPC-type patients was significantly longer than that of the AsMes-type patients (19.9 vs 12.8 months). This finding was in agreement with the Oncomine analysis of TCGA datasets, which revealed that PDGFRA and Olig2 were favorable prognostic factors and podoplanin and CD44 were associated with a poor clinical outcome. This is the first study to establish a subclassification of GBM on the basis of immunohistochemical analysis.

"""Chloride intracellular channel 1 activity is not required for glioblastoma development but its inhibition dictates glioma stem cell responsivity to novel biguanide derivatives.""","""Background: Chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) activity controls glioblastoma proliferation. Metformin exerts antitumor effects in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) inhibiting CLIC1 activity, but its low potency hampers its translation in clinical settings. Methods: We synthesized a small library of novel biguanide-based compounds that were tested as antiproliferative agents for GSCs derived from human glioblastomas, in vitro using 2D and 3D cultures and in vivo in the zebrafish model. Compounds were compared to metformin for both potency and efficacy in the inhibition of GSC proliferation in vitro (MTT, Trypan blue exclusion assays, and EdU labeling) and in vivo (zebrafish model), migration (Boyden chamber assay), invasiveness (Matrigel invasion assay), self-renewal (spherogenesis assay), and CLIC1 activity (electrophysiology recordings), as well as for the absence of off-target toxicity (effects on normal stem cells and toxicity for zebrafish and chick embryos). Results: We identified Q48 and Q54 as two novel CLIC1 blockers, characterized by higher antiproliferative potency than metformin in vitro, in both GSC 2D cultures and 3D spheroids. Q48 and Q54 also impaired GSC self-renewal, migration and invasion, and displayed low systemic in vivo toxicity. Q54 reduced in vivo proliferation of GSCs xenotransplanted in zebrafish hindbrain. Target specificity was confirmed by recombinant CLIC1 binding experiments using microscale thermophoresis approach. Finally, we characterized GSCs from GBMs spontaneously expressing low CLIC1 protein, demonstrating their ability to grow in vivo and to retain stem-like phenotype and functional features in vitro. In these GSCs, Q48 and Q54 displayed reduced potency and efficacy as antiproliferative agents as compared to high CLIC1-expressing tumors. However, in 3D cultures, metformin and Q48 (but not Q54) inhibited proliferation, which was dependent on the inhibition dihydrofolate reductase activity. Conclusions: These data highlight that, while CLIC1 is dispensable for the development of a subset of glioblastomas, it acts as a booster of proliferation in the majority of these tumors and its functional expression is required for biguanide antitumor class-effects. In particular, the biguanide-based derivatives Q48 and Q54, represent the leads to develop novel compounds endowed with better pharmacological profiles than metformin, to act as CLIC1-blockers for the treatment of CLIC1-expressing glioblastomas, in a precision medicine approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135603

In order to assess the differences in volume and shape of the radiotherapy target, the use of pre-operative vs post-operative/pre-radiotherapy T(1) and T(2) weighted MRI was compared. Methods: 4 CTVs were delineated in 24 patients pre-operatively and post-operatively using T(1) contrast-enhanced (T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV) and T(2) weighted images (T2(PRE)CTV and T2(POST)CTV). Pre-operative MRI examinations were performed the day before surgery, whereas post-operative examinations were acquired 1 month after surgery and before chemoradiation. A concordance index (CI) was defined as the ratio between the overlapping and composite volumes. Results: The volumes of T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV were not statistically different (248 ± 88 vs 254 ± 101), although volume differences >100 cm(3) were observed in 6 out of 24 patients. A marked increase due to tumour progression was shown in three patients. Three patients showed a decrease because of a reduced mass effect. A significant reduction occurred between pre-operative and post-operative T(2) volumes (139 ± 68 vs 78 ± 59). Lack of concordance was observed between T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV (CI = 0.67 ± 0.09), T2(PRE)CTV and T2(POST)CTV (CI = 0.39 ± 0.20) and comparing the portion of the T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV not covered by that defined on T2(PRE)CTV images (CI = 0.45 ± 0.16 and 0.44 ± 0.17, respectively). Conclusion: Using T(2) MRI, huge variations can be observed in peritumoural oedema, which are probably due to steroid treatment. Using T(1) MRI, brain shifts after surgery and possible progressive enhancing lesions produce substantial differences in CTVs. Our data support the use of post-operative/pre-radiotherapy T(1) weighted MRI for planning purposes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045069

In this study, we introduce a spatial proteomic workflow termed Hyperplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging (HIFI) that overcomes these limitations. HIFI allows for the simultaneous analysis of > 45 markers in fragile tissue sections at high magnification, using a cost-effective high-throughput workflow. We integrate HIFI with machine learning feature detection, graph-based network analysis, and cluster-based neighborhood analysis to analyze the microenvironment response to radiation therapy in a preclinical model of glioblastoma, and compare this response to a mouse model of breast-to-brain metastasis. Here we show that glioblastomas undergo extensive spatial reorganization of immune cell populations and structural architecture in response to treatment, while brain metastases show no comparable reorganization.

Materials and methods: Seven internally derived MR imaging features were assessed in 180 patients, and 25 features from the Visually AcceSAble Rembrandt Images feature set were assessed in 164 patients. Glioblastomas were divided into subtypes based on the telomere maintenance mechanism: alternative lengthening of telomeres positive (ALT+) and negative (ALT-) and the content of tumor-associated macrophages (with [M+] or without [M-] a high content of macrophages). The 3 most frequent subtypes (ALT+/M-, ALT-/M+, and ALT-/M-) were correlated with MR imaging features and clinical parameters. The fourth group (ALT+/M+) did not have enough cases for correlation with MR imaging features. Results: Tumors with a regular margin and those lacking a fungating margin, an expansive T1/FLAIR ratio, and reduced ependymal extension were more frequent in the subgroup of ALT+/M- (P < .05). Radiologic necrosis, lack of cystic component (by both criteria), and extensive peritumoral edema were more frequent in ALT-/M+ tumors (P < .05). Multivariate testing with a Cox regression analysis found the cystic imaging feature was additive to tumor subtype, and O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) status to predict improved patient survival (P < .05).

Apart from de novo glioblastoma, it is currently accepted that these malignancies mainly progress from lower grade glial tumors. However, the molecular entities governing the progression of gliomas are poorly understood. Extracellular and membrane proteins are key biomolecules found at the cell-to-cell communication interface and hence are a promising proteome subpopulation that could help understand the development of glioma. Accordingly, the current study aims at identifying new protein markers of human glioma progression. For this purpose, we used glial tumors generated orthotopically with T98G and U373 human glioma cells in nude mice. This setup allowed also to discriminate the protein origin, namely, human (tumor) or mouse (host). Extracellular and membrane proteins were selectively purified using biotinylation followed by streptavidin affinity chromatography. Isolated proteins were digested and then identified and quantified employing 2D-nano-HPLC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 23 and 27 up-regulated extracellular and membrane proteins were identified in the T98G and U373 models, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of these were predominantly produced by the tumor, whereas the remaining proteins appeared to be mainly overexpressed by the host tissue. Following extensive validation, we have focused our attention on sparc-like protein 1. This protein was further investigated using immunohistochemistry in a large collection of human glioma samples of different grades.

We have previously discovered the tumor-suppressor properties of the microRNA cluster miR-302-367, representing a potential treatment for glioblastoma. Here, we attempted to develop a cell-based therapy by taking advantage of the capability of glioma cells to secrete exosomes that enclose small RNA molecules. We engineered primary glioma cells to stably express the miR-302-367. Remarkably, these cells altered, in a paracrine-dependent manner, the expression of stemness markers, the proliferation and the tumorigenicity of neighboring glioblastoma cells. Further characterization of the secretome derived from miR-302-367 expressing cells showed that a large amount of miR-302-367 was enclosed in exosomes, which were internalized by the neighboring glioblastoma cells. This miR-302-367 cell-to-cell transfer resulted in the inhibition of its targets such as CXCR4/SDF1, SHH, cyclin D, cyclin A and E2F1.

In multivariate analysis, KPS at the start of RT (≥ 80%), methylated MGMT promotor, and residual tumor size (< 2 cm3) were significantly associated with increased survival with KPS ≥ 50%.

"""CD98 immunoreactivity in multinucleated giant cells of glioblastomas: an immunohistochemical double labeling study.""","""CD98, which is identical to fusion regulatory protein-1 (FRP-1), has been reported to induce and regulate cell fusion and multinucleated giant cell formation. To investigate the association between CD98 and multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) in glioblastomas, we investigate the CD98 immunoreactivity of MNGCs and the proliferative potential in CD98 immunoreactive MNGCs in paraffin-embedded sections obtained from patients with glioblastomas. Double immunohistochemical staining for CD98 and Ki67 as a mitotic marker were performed in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from 16 patients with primary glioblastomas including MNGCs. Most CD98 immunoreactive (CD98+) tumor cells were negative for Ki67. CD98+ MNGCs were identified in 15 cases. CD98+ Ki67- MNGCs were identified in 14 cases and ranged in number from one to 48 (6.7 +/- 11.5). CD98- Ki67+ MNGCs were identified in 15 cases and ranged in number from one to 32 (11.1 +/- 9.6). Mitotic index (MI) of CD98+ MNGCs (4.8 +/- 2.7%) was significantly lower than that of CD98- MNGCs (91.1 +/- 24.6%) (P < 0001). These results suggest that multinucleated giant cell formation may be developed by fusion among CD98- producing cells in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18021193

The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with a delay-invariant singular-value decomposition algorithm (SVD+) and a Patlak plot in differentiating glioblastomas from lymphomas. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 17 adult patients (12 men and 5 women) with pathologically proven glioblastomas (n=10) and lymphomas (n=7). CTP data were analyzed using SVD+ and a Patlak plot. The relative tumor blood volume and flow compared to contralateral normal-appearing gray matter (rCBV and rCBF derived from SVD+, and rBV and rFlow derived from the Patlak plot) were used to differentiate between glioblastomas and lymphomas. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used for statistical analysis. Results: Glioblastomas showed significantly higher rFlow (3.05±0.49, mean±standard deviation) than lymphomas (1.56±0.53; P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between glioblastomas and lymphomas in rBV (2.52±1.57 vs. 1.03±0.51; P>0.05), rCBF (1.38±0.41 vs. 1.29±0.47; P>0.05), or rCBV (1.78±0.47 vs. 1.87±0.66; P>0.05). ROC analysis showed the best diagnostic performance with rFlow (Az=0.871), followed by rBV (Az=0.771), rCBF (Az=0.614), and rCBV (Az=0.529).

"""Characterization of astroglial versus oligodendroglial phenotypes in glioblastomas by means of quantitative morphonuclear variables generated by computer-assisted microscopy.""","""The current WHO classification places glioblastomas in the astrocytoma category. However, whether or not glioblastomas also show oligodendroglial differentiation remains a matter of controversy. This study investigates, at the morphonuclear level, the hypothesis that some glioblastomas (GBMs) may also represent the ultimate level of malignancy in the oligodendroglial lineage. Using a series of 164 GBMs, we sought to ascertain whether any of these GBMs exhibited phenotypical characteristics that were more closely related to oligodendroglial lineages than astrocytic lineages. Phenotypical features were quantitatively determined by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei, a process that made it possible to quantitatively describe the patterns of the cell nuclei (and, more specifically, of their chromatin) through 16 variables, and the distribution of the nuclear DNA content (DNA ploidy) through 8 variables. The phenotypical characteristics typical of astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors were analyzed by means of Discriminant Analysis, a statistical multivariate analysis, performed on a series of 65 astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors. This series consisted of 14 WHO grade II and 19 grade III astrocytomas and 24 WHO grade II and 8 grade III oligodendrogliomas. This multivariate analysis enabled an accurate model to be produced that distinguished between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas on the basis of 5 cytometry-generated variables. This model was used to characterize the phenotype of each of the 164 glioblastomas. The results show that of these 164 glioblastomas, 6 (about 3.5%) displayed phenotypes that were very similar to oligodendrogliomas, and 141 displayed phenotypes that were very similar to astrocytomas. The phenotypes of the 17 remaining GBMs were too ambiguous to be categorized as having a pure astrocytic or oligodendroglial lineage.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9720494

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are histologically characterized by striking microvascular proliferation. The identification of the mechanism of angiogenesis is of major importance for the further development of anti-angiogenic therapy. Tumor angiogenesis might be the result of a combination of local tissue conditions (especially hypoxia) and specific genetic alterations acquired during oncogenesis. In order to investigate the relationship between genetic aberrations and tumor angiogenesis in GBM xenograft lines, the genetic alterations were examined by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). Two vascular phenotypes of GBM xenografts could be identified: a well vascularized and a poorly vascularized type.

"""Optimizing Tissue Harvesting Techniques for Establishing Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoids.""","""Objective: Brain tumors display remarkable cellular and molecular diversity, significantly impacting the progression and outcomes of the disease. The utilization of tumor tissue acquired through surgical handheld devices for tumor characterization raises important questions regarding translational research. This study seeks to evaluate the integrity of tissue resected using a microdebrider (MD) in the context of establishing tumor organoids from glioblastomas (GBM). Methods: Tumor samples were collected from patients with GBM using both tumor forceps (en bloc) and a MD. The time required to protocol completion and cell viability of paired samples was measured. H&E staining was performed to examine histologic morphology. Results: Ten paired samples were obtained from GBM patients using tumor forceps and the MD. Samples collected with the MD demonstrated significantly shorter processing times compared to those obtained through en bloc resection, with overall means of 31.7 ± 2.4 mins and 38.8±3 mins, respectively (P < 0.001). Cell viability measured at the end of protocol completion was comparable between tissues obtained using both the MD and en bloc, with mean viabilities of 80.2 ± 12.4% and 79.1 ± 12.5%, respectively (P = 0.848). H&E examination of tissues revealed no significant differences in the cellular and histologic characteristics of paired samples obtained using both methods across GBM tumors, nor in the corresponding established organoids. Conclusions: Tumor tissues obtained using the MD and en bloc methods demonstrate a high success rate in establishing GBM organoids, with the MD offering the advantage of significantly reduced processing time.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of different heterogeneous subregions of GBM on overall survival (OS) stratification. A total of 105 GBM patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into long-term and short-term OS groups. Four MRI sequences, including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1C), T1, T2, and FLAIR, were collected for each patient. Then, 4 heterogeneous subregions, i.e. the region of entire abnormality (rEA), the regions of contrast-enhanced tumor (rCET), necrosis (rNec) and edema/non-contrast-enhanced tumor (rE/nCET), were manually drawn from the 4 MRI sequences. For each subregion, 50 radiomics features were extracted. The stratification performance of 4 heterogeneous subregions, as well as the performances of 4 MRI sequences, was evaluated both alone and in combination. Our results showed that rEA was superior in stratifying long-and short-term OS. For the 4 MRI sequences used in this study, the FLAIR sequence demonstrated the best performance of survival stratification based on the manual delineation of heterogeneous subregions. Our results suggest that heterogeneous subregions of GBMs contain different prognostic information, which should be considered when investigating survival stratification in patients with GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34318731
"""Leakage decrease detected by dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI predicts survival in recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab.""","""Background and purpose: In glioblastoma, tumor progression appears to be triggered by expression of VEGF, a regulator of blood vessel permeability. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits angiogenesis by clearing circulating VEGF, resulting in a decline in the contrast-enhancing tumor, which does not always correlate with treatment response. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate whether changes in DSC perfusion MRI-derived leakage could predict survival in recurrent glioblastoma, and (2) to estimate whether leakage at baseline was related to treatment outcome. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed DSC perfusion MRI in 24 recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab as second line chemotherapy. Leakage at baseline and changes in maximum leakage between baseline and the first follow-up after treatment were selected for quantitative analysis. Survival univariate analysis was made constructing survival curves using Kaplan-Meier method and comparing subgroups by log rank probability test. Results: Leakage reduction at 8 weeks after initiation of bevacizumab treatment had a significant influence on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Median OS and PFS were 2.4 and 2.8 months longer for patients with leakage reduction at the first follow-up. Higher leakage at baseline was associated with leakage reduction after treatment. Odds ratio of treatment response was 9 for patients with maximum leakage at baseline >5. Conclusions: Leakage decrease may predict OS and PFS in recurrent glioblastomas treated with bevacizumab. Leakage reduction postulates as a potential biomarker for treatment response evaluation. Leakage at baseline seems to predict response to treatment, but was not independently associated with survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27026567
"""Phosphatase and tensin homologue deficiency in glioblastoma confers resistance to radiation and temozolomide that is reversed by the protease inhibitor nelfinavir.""","""Glioblastomas are malignant brain tumors that are very difficult to cure, even with aggressive therapy consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Glioblastomas frequently have loss of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), leading to the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We examined whether PTEN deficiency leads to radioresistance and whether this can be reversed by nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor that decreases Akt signaling. Nelfinavir decreased Akt phosphorylation and enhanced radiosensitization in U251MG and U87MG glioblastoma cells, both of which are PTEN deficient. In the derivative line U251MG-PTEN, induction of wild-type PTEN with doxycycline decreased P-Akt expression and increased radiosensitivity to a similar extent as nelfinavir. Combining these two approaches had no greater effect on radiosensitivity than either alone. This epistasis-type analysis suggests that the nelfinavir acts along the Akt pathway to radiosensitize cells. However, nelfinavir neither decreased Akt phosphorylation in immortalized human astrocytes nor radiosensitized them. Radiosensitization was also assessed in vivo using a tumor regrowth delay assay in nude mice implanted with U87MG xenografts. The mean time to reach 1,000 mm(3) in the radiation + nelfinavir group was 71 days, as compared with 41, 34, or 45 days for control, nelfinavir alone, or radiation alone groups, respectively. A significant synergistic effect on tumor regrowth was detected between radiation and nelfinavir. (P = 0.01). Nelfinavir also increased the sensitivity of U251MG cells to temozolomide. These results support the clinical investigation of nelfinavir in combination with radiation and temozolomide in future clinical trials for patients with glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17483362

All patients provided signed consent, and the local research ethics committee approved the study. Patients underwent surgical resection, and tumor samples underwent immunohistochemistry for IDH-1 R132H mutations. DT imaging data were coregistered to the anatomic magnetic resonance study and reconstructed to provide the anisotropic and isotropic components of the DT. The invasive phenotype was determined by using previously published criteria and correlated with IDH-1 mutation status by using the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test. Results Nine patients had an IDH-1 mutation and 61 had IDH-1 wild type. All of the patients with IDH-1 mutation had a minimally invasive DT imaging phenotype. Among the IDH-1 wild-type tumors, 42 of 61 (69%) were diffusively invasive glioblastomas, 14 of 61 (23%) were locally invasive, and five of 61 (8%) were minimally invasive (P < .001).

"""Targeting EGFR induced oxidative stress by PARP1 inhibition in glioblastoma therapy.""","""Despite the critical role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma pathogenesis, EGFR targeted therapies have achieved limited clinical efficacy. Here we propose an alternate therapeutic strategy based on the conceptual framework of non-oncogene addiction. A directed RNAi screen revealed that glioblastoma cells over-expressing EGFRvIII, an oncogenic variant of EGFR, become hyper-dependent on a variety of DNA repair genes. Among these, there was an enrichment of Base Excision Repair (BER) genes required for the repair of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced DNA damage, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Subsequent studies revealed that EGFRvIII over-expression in glioblastoma cells caused increased levels of ROS, DNA strand break accumulation, and genome instability. In a panel of primary glioblastoma lines, sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition correlated with the levels of EGFR activation and oxidative stress. Gene expression analysis indicated that reduced expression of BER genes in glioblastomas with high EGFR expression correlated with improved patient survival. These observations suggest that oxidative stress secondary to EGFR hyper-activation necessitates increased cellular reliance on PARP1 mediated BER, and offer critical insights into clinical trial design.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20532243
"""Cancer stem cells in glioblastoma--molecular signaling and therapeutic targeting.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly lethal primary brain tumors. Despite current therapeutic advances in other solid cancers, the treatment of these malignant gliomas remains essentially palliative. GBMs are extremely resistant to conventional radiation and chemotherapies. We and others have demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called GBM stem cells (GSCs) promotes therapeutic resistance. We also found that GSCs stimulate tumor angiogenesis by expressing elevated levels of VEGF and contribute to tumor growth, which has been translated into a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of recurrent or progressive GBMs. Furthermore, stem cell-like cancer cells (cancer stem cells) have been shown to promote metastasis. Although GBMs rarely metastasize beyond the central nervous system, these highly infiltrative cancers often invade into normal brain tissues preventing surgical resection, and GSCs display an aggressive invasive phenotype. These studies suggest that targeting GSCs may effectively reduce tumor recurrence and significantly improve GBM treatment. Recent studies indicate that cancer stem cells share core signaling pathways with normal somatic or embryonic stem cells, but also display critical distinctions that provide important clues into useful therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the current understanding and advances in glioma stem cell research, and discuss potential targeting strategies for future development of anti-GSC therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21203936
"""Detection of PD-L1 Expression in Temozolomide-Resistant Glioblastoma by Using PD-L1 Antibodies Conjugated with Lipid-Coated Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide.""","""Purpose: Targeted superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles are a promising tool for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis. Lipid-coated SPIO nanoparticles have a nonfouling property that can reduce nonspecific binding to off-target cells and prevent agglomeration, making them suitable contrast agents for molecular MRI diagnosis. PD-L1 is a poor prognostic factor for patients with glioblastoma. Most recurrent glioblastomas are temozolomide resistant. Diagnostic probes targeting PD-L1 could facilitate early diagnosis and be used to predict responses to targeted PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with primary or recurrent glioblastoma. We conjugated lipid-coated SPIO nanoparticles with PD-L1 antibodies to identify PD-L1 expression in glioblastoma or temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma by using MRI. Methods: The synthesized PD-L1 antibody-conjugated SPIO (PDL1-SPIO) nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential assays, transmission electron microscopy images, Prussian blue assay, in vitro cell affinity assay, and animal MRI analysis. Results: PDL1-SPIO exhibited a specific binding capacity to PD-L1 of the mouse glioblastoma cell line (GL261). The presence and quantity of PDL1-SPIO in temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cells and tumor tissue were confirmed through Prussian blue staining and in vivo T2* map MRI, respectively. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that PDL1-SPIO can specifically target temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma with PD-L1 expression in the brain and can be quantified through MRI analysis, thus making it suitable for the diagnosis of PD-L1 expression in temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34366665

Unlike non-tumor stem cells, tumor stem cells lack the normal mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation, resulting in uncontrolled production and incomplete differentiation of tumor cells. Discovering the role of tumor stem cells in the brain has given us a new perspective about the molecular pathways involved in signaling and about oncogenesis in the central nervous system; it can also help us explain the high rate of recurrence of some tumors and the diffuse nature of glioblastomas.

"""A 4-miRNA signature to predict survival in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas are among the most lethal cancers; however, recent advances in survival have increased the need for better prognostic markers. microRNAs (miRNAs) hold great prognostic potential being deregulated in glioblastomas and highly stable in stored tissue specimens. Moreover, miRNAs control multiple genes representing an additional level of gene regulation possibly more prognostically powerful than a single gene. The aim of the study was to identify a novel miRNA signature with the ability to separate patients into prognostic subgroups. Samples from 40 glioblastoma patients were included retrospectively; patients were comparable on all clinical aspects except overall survival enabling patients to be categorized as short-term or long-term survivors based on median survival. A miRNome screening was employed, and a prognostic profile was developed using leave-one-out cross-validation. We found that expression patterns of miRNAs; particularly the four miRNAs: hsa-miR-107_st, hsa-miR-548x_st, hsa-miR-3125_st and hsa-miR-331-3p_st could determine short- and long-term survival with a predicted accuracy of 78%. Heatmap dendrograms dichotomized glioblastomas into prognostic subgroups with a significant association to survival in univariate (HR 8.50; 95% CI 3.06-23.62; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (HR 9.84; 95% CI 2.93-33.06; p<0.001). Similar tendency was seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using a 2-miRNA signature of miR-107 and miR-331 (miR sum score), which were the only miRNAs available in TCGA. In TCGA, patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated tumors and low miR sum score had the shortest survival. Adjusting for age and MGMT status, low miR sum score was associated with a poorer prognosis (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97; p = 0.033). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis predicted the identified miRNAs to regulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation and survival.

In situ hybridization analyses have revealed that Olig genes are expressed in oligodendroglial lineage cells and are highly expressed in oligodendrogliomas. To clarify whether OLIG is a tumor-specific marker for oligodendrogliomas, we have investigated the expression of Olig transcripts by semiquantitative RT-PCR assay and OLIG2 protein with a new antibody in a variety of glial tumors. The semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that high levels of expression of Olig1 and Olig2 mRNAs were present in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, while expression of these mRNAs in grade IV glioblastomas was lower than in grade II and grade III gliomas (p < 0.01). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the mean immunopositive proportion of OLIG2 was 82% in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas but only 34% in anaplastic astrocytomas. Therefore, although OLIG2 expression was detected in a range of gliomas not specific for oligodendrogliomas, the expression level in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas was more uniform and intense than that in other glial tumors. In conclusion, combining Olig mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry of OLIG2 enables oligodendrogliomas to be distinguished from glioblastomas and other astrocytic glial tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575240

"""Advanced imaging reveals enhanced malignancy in glioblastomas involving the subventricular zone: evidence of increased infiltrative growth and perfusion.""","""Background: Glioblastoma's infiltrative growth and heterogeneity are influenced by neural, molecular, genetic, and immunological factors, with the precise origin of these tumors remaining elusive. Neurogenic zones might serve as the tumor stem cells' nest, with tumors in contact with these zones exhibiting worse outcomes and more aggressive growth patterns. This study aimed to determine if these characteristics are reflected in advanced imaging, specifically diffusion and perfusion data. Methods: In this monocentric retrospective study, 137 glioblastoma therapy-naive patients (IDH-wildtype, grade 4) with advanced preoperative MRI, including perfusion and diffusion imaging, were analyzed. Tumors and neurogenic zones were automatically segmented. Advanced imaging metrics, including cerebral blood volume (CBV) from perfusion imaging, tissue volume mask (TVM), and free water corrected fractional anisotropy (FA-FWE) from diffusion imaging, were extracted. Results: SVZ infiltration positively correlated with CBV, indicating higher perfusion in tumors. Significant CBV differences were noted between high and low SVZ infiltration cases at specific percentiles. Negative correlation was observed with TVM and positive correlation with FA-FWE, suggesting more infiltrative tumor growth. Significant differences in TVM and FA-FWE values were found between high and low SVZ infiltration cases. Discussion: Glioblastomas with SVZ infiltration exhibit distinct imaging characteristics, including higher perfusion and lower cell density per voxel, indicating a more infiltrative growth and higher vascularization. Stem cell-like characteristics in SVZ-infiltrating cells could explain the increased infiltration and aggressive behavior. Understanding these imaging and biological correlations could enhance the understanding of glioblastoma evolution.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39387957

"""Discriminating pyogenic brain abscesses, necrotic glioblastomas, and necrotic metastatic brain tumors by means of susceptibility-weighted imaging.""","""Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to discriminate abscesses and necrotic tumours. Methods: Twenty-one patients with pyogenic abscesses, 21 patients with rim-enhancing glioblastomas and 23 patients with rim-enhancing metastases underwent SWI. Intralesional susceptibility signal (ILSS) was analyzed employing both qualitative (QL) and semi-quantitative (SQ) methods. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to demonstrate the discriminating power. Results: In QL analysis, ILSSs were seen in 12 of 21 abscesses, in 20 of 21 glioblastomas, and in 16 of 23 metastases. In SQ analysis, a low degree of ILSS (85.8 %) was in the majority of abscesses and a high degree of ILSS (76.2 %) was in the majority of glioblastomas. SQ model was significantly better than QL model in distinguishing abscesses from glioblastomas (P < .001). A derived ILSS cutoff grade of 1 or less was quantified as having a sensitivity of 85.7 %, specificity of 90.5 %, accuracy of 88.1 %, PPV of 90.0 %, and NPV of 86.4 % in distinguishing abscesses from glioblastomas. Conclusions: A high-grade ILSS may help distinguish glioblastomas from abscesses and necrotic metastatic brain tumours. The lack of ILSS or low-grade ILSS can be a more specific sign in the imaging diagnosis of abscesses. Key points: • ILSS of SWI can contribute to differential diagnosis of rim-enhanced mass. • Low-grade ILSS can be a more specific sign in abscesses. • High-grade ILSS may help distinguish necrotic glioblastomas from abscesses. • ILSS spreads across the four ILSS categories in metastases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25465712
"""Anti-Apoptotic and Anti-Oxidant Proteins in Glioblastomas: Immunohistochemical Expression of Beclin and DJ-1 and Its Correlation with Prognosis.""","""DJ-1 deglycase is a protein with anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties and its role in oncogenesis is controversial. Indeed in primary breast cancer and non-small-cell lung carcinoma, its higher expression was shown in more aggressive tumors while in other neoplasms (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma), higher expression was related to better prognosis. Beclin has a relevant role in autophagy and cellular death regulation, processes that are well known to be impaired in neoplastic cells. DJ-1 shows the ability to modulate signal transduction. It can modulate autophagy through many signaling pathways, a process that can mediate either cell survival or cell death depending on the circumstances. Previously, it has been suggested that the involvement of DJ-1 in autophagy regulation may play a role in tumorigenesis. The aim of our study was to investigate the link between DJ-1 and Beclin-1 in glioblastoma through the immunohistochemical expression of such proteins and to correlate the data obtained with prognosis. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and the immunoscores were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated. A statistically significant association between DJ-1 score and recurrence (p = 0.0189) and between the former and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation (p = 0.0072) was observed. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed that a higher DJ-1 score was associated with longer overall survival (p = 0.0253, ĸ2 = 5.005). Furthermore, an unexpected direct correlation (p = 0.0424, r = 0.4009) between DJ-1 and Beclin score was evident. The most significant result of the present study was the evidence of high DJ-1 expression in IDH-mutant tumors and in cases with longer overall survival. This finding could aid, together with IDH1, in the identification of glioblastomas with better prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31434323
"""A novel prognostic six-CpG signature in glioblastomas.""","""Aims: We aimed to identify a clinically useful biomarker using DNA methylation-based information to optimize individual treatment of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: A six-CpG panel was identified by incorporating genome-wide DNA methylation data and clinical information of three distinct discovery sets and was combined using a risk-score model. Different validation sets of GBMs and lower-grade gliomas and different statistical methods were implemented for prognostic evaluation. An integrative analysis of multidimensional TCGA data was performed to molecularly characterize different risk tumors. Results: The six-CpG risk-score signature robustly predicted overall survival (OS) in all discovery and validation cohorts and in a treatment-independent manner. It also predicted progression-free survival (PFS) in available patients. The multimarker epigenetic signature was demonstrated as an independent prognosticator and had better performance than known molecular indicators such as glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) and proneural subtype. The defined risk subgroups were molecularly distinct; high-risk tumors were biologically more aggressive with concordant activation of proangiogenic signaling at multimolecular levels. Accordingly, we observed better OS benefits of bevacizumab-contained therapy to high-risk patients in independent sets, supporting its implication in guiding usage of antiangiogenic therapy. Finally, the six-CpG signature refined the risk classification based on G-CIMP and MGMT methylation status. Conclusions: The novel six-CpG signature is a robust and independent prognostic indicator for GBMs and is of promising value to improve personalized management.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29350455

Several commonly deleted regions have been proposed; however, they are not coincident. We have deletion mapped chromosome 10 in 198 astrocytic gliomas using 53 microsatellite markers. Two commonly deleted regions on 10p were identified, one of which lies between D10S594 and D10S559 and the other between D10S1713 and D10S189. Most of 10q deletions were large and included a region distal to D10S554. Four glioblastomas of 122 had patterns suggestive of homozygous deletions at D10S541, a locus close and distally located to the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Losses of alleles were found not only in glioblastomas (93%) but also in anaplastic astrocytomas (66%) and in astrocytomas (35%). Most glioblastomas lost one entire chromosome 10, while astrocytomas preferentially lost only 10p.

"""FDG-PET as a prognostic factor in high-grade astrocytoma.""","""Background: The prognostic value of the metabolic status of cerebral gliomas determined by positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) has been established in populations with a mixture of grades 2, 3 and 4 gliomas, but remains uncertain when only malignant gliomas are considered (grade 3 and 4). Methods: FDG-PET performed in 30 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III) and 61 patients with glioblastoma (grade 4) were classified according to a metabolic grading. The uptake of FDG was lower in the tumor compared to white matter (WM) in grade 1 (4 glioblastoma, 4 anaplastic astrocytoma), it was intermediate between WM and cortex in grade 2 (20 glioblastoma, 22 anaplastic astrocytoma), and it was superior to cortex in grade 3 (38 glioblastoma, 4 anaplastic astrocytoma). Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves were similar in patient with grades 1 and 2, but were significantly worse (p = 0.007) in grade 3. In multivariate analysis considering age, pathological grade (anaplastic astrocytoma versus glioblastoma), and metabolic grades, the metabolic grade did not appear to be an independent prognostic factor. When anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas were considered separately, metabolic grade is of predictive value only in the group of glioblastomas. Conclusion: In malignant gliomas, metabolic grading determined by FDG-PET was not superior to the pathological grading for survival prediction. Still, it remains of predictive value when applied to malignant gliomas histologically classified as glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11206011
"""Impact of p53 status to response of temozolomide in low MGMT expression glioblastomas: preliminary results.""","""Objective: This study was designed to assess the clinical outcomes of MGMT low expression glioblastomas with different p53 statuses to the treatment of temozolomide capsule chemotherapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, glioblastomas with low MGMT expression receiving surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide capsule chemotherapy were divided into high and low mutant p53 expression groups. Patient age, gender, KPS score and extent of resection were analysed between the two groups by t-test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. Correlation between p53 status and control of tumor growth was analysed by survival analysis. Results: In total, 30 patients were included in the study. No statistically significant differences in age, gender, KPS score or extent of resection existed between the two groups. Patients with both low mutant p53 expression and low MGMT had much longer progression-free survival time to temozolomide capsule than those with high mutant p53 expression and low MGMT (p<0.05) Overall survival time did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. Conclusion: p53 in addition to MGMT plays a role in chemotherapy resistance to temozolomide.

"""Glioblastoma and Other Primary Brain Malignancies in Adults: A Review.""","""Importance: Malignant primary brain tumors cause more than 15 000 deaths per year in the United States. The annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals and increases with age. Five-year survival is approximately 36%. Observations: Approximately 49% of malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas, and 30% are diffusely infiltrating lower-grade gliomas. Other malignant brain tumors include primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (7%) and malignant forms of ependymomas (3%) and meningiomas (2%). Symptoms of malignant brain tumors include headache (50%), seizures (20%-50%), neurocognitive impairment (30%-40%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%-40%). Magnetic resonance imaging before and after a gadolinium-based contrast agent is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating brain tumors. Diagnosis requires tumor biopsy with consideration of histopathological and molecular characteristics. Treatment varies by tumor type and often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. For patients with glioblastoma, the combination of temozolomide with radiotherapy improved survival when compared with radiotherapy alone (2-year survival, 27.2% vs 10.9%; 5-year survival, 9.8% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.7]; P < .001). In patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q codeletion, probable 20-year overall survival following radiotherapy without vs with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine was 13.6% vs 37.1% (80 patients; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.35-1.03]; P = .06) in the EORTC 26951 trial and 14.9% vs 37% in the RTOG 9402 trial (125 patients; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40-0.94]; P = .02). Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma includes high-dose methotrexate-containing regimens, followed by consolidation therapy with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimens, or whole brain radiation. Conclusions and relevance: The incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals, and approximately 49% of primary malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas. Most patients die from progressive disease.

We compared the Ki-67 LI of 20 primary glioblastomas and their recurrent tumors with the time to reoperation for recurrence. Regression analyses showed (1) a high reproducibility of the LIs at the second versus the first operation corresponding to an inherent growth potential of a given individual tumor and (2) a strong inverse correlation of LI to time to recurrence (TR) (r = -0.92). Additionally to a lower LI (corresponding to a smaller growth fraction), a longer cycle time could be derived in slowly growing as compared to rapidly growing tumors.

"""Knockdown of CypA inhibits interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-8-mediated proliferation and tumor growth of glioblastoma cells through down-regulated NF-kappaB.""","""Although cyclophilin A (CypA) has been reported to be over-expressed in cancer cells and solid tumors, its expression and role in glioblastomas have not been studied. Herein, we show that expression of CypA in human glioblastoma cell lines and tissues is significantly higher than in normal human astrocytes and normal counterparts of brain tissue. To determine the role of over-expressed CypA in glioblastoma, stable RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of CypA (CypA KD) was performed in gliobastoma cell line U87vIII (U87MG · ΔEGFR). CypA KD stable single clones decrease proliferation, infiltration, migration, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and with slower growth in vivo as xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice. We have also observed that knockdown of CypA inhibits expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a tumorigenic and proangiogenic cytokine. Conversely, enforced expression of CypA in the CypA KD cell line, Ud-12, markedly enhanced IL-8 transcripts and restored Ud-12 proliferation, suggesting that CypA-mediated IL-8 production provides a growth advantage to glioblastoma cells. CypA knockdown-mediated inhibition of IL-8 is due to reduced activity of NF-κB, which is one of the major transcription factors regulating IL-8 expression. These results not only establish the relevance of CypA to glioblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo, but also suggest that small interfering RNA-based CypA knockdown could be an effective therapeutic approach against glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20454998
"""Deciphering the Role of Autophagy in Treatment of Resistance Mechanisms in Glioblastoma.""","""Autophagy is a process essential for cellular energy consumption, survival, and defense mechanisms. The role of autophagy in several types of human cancers has been explicitly explained; however, the underlying molecular mechanism of autophagy in glioblastoma remains ambiguous. Autophagy is thought to be a 'double-edged sword', and its effect on tumorigenesis varies with cell type. On the other hand, autophagy may play a significant role in the resistance mechanisms against various therapies. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms deriving the autophagy-mediated therapeutic resistance and designing improved treatment strategies for glioblastoma. In this review, we discuss autophagy mechanisms, specifically its pro-survival and growth-suppressing mechanisms in glioblastomas. In addition, we try to shed some light on the autophagy-mediated activation of the cellular mechanisms supporting radioresistance and chemoresistance in glioblastoma. This review also highlights autophagy's involvement in glioma stem cell behavior, underlining its role as a potential molecular target for therapeutic interventions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33525678

These findings were contrasted with those of five cases of anaplastic astrocytomas. The microfluorometric determination of DNA was performed on mechanically isolated single cells stained by the Feulgen method, obtained from selected areas of the neoplasms in paraffin blocks. Twelve of 16 cases of glioblastoma multiforme had a main population that was diploid-near diploid. Although four of the five anaplastic astrocytomas disclosed a diploid-near diploid main population there was a more complex DNA distribution than in the small cells in glioblastomas. These differences were evident using two numerical DNA indices obtained from the analysis of each tumor histogram which defined, respectively, the extent to which the main tumor cell population deviated from euploid values and the probabilities to have multiple stemlines with abnormal DNA content. The results suggest that small anaplastic cells which appear to represent the most aggressive population in glioblastomas have a DNA content diploid-near diploid, and in malignant gliomas the degree of aneuploidy of the main stemline is not related to the biologic behavior of the neoplasm.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2438028

From these, 112 cases of glioblastoma multiforme and 50 cases of anaplastic astrocytoma were chosen for analysis. Results: The group of patients with glioblastomas showed a median survival of 415 days.

"""Effect of human skin-derived stem cells on vessel architecture, tumor growth, and tumor invasion in brain tumor animal models.""","""Glioblastomas represent an important cause of cancer-related mortality with poor survival. Despite many advances, the mean survival time has not significantly improved in the last decades. New experimental approaches have shown tumor regression after the grafting of neural stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells into experimental intracranial gliomas of adult rodents. However, the cell source seems to be an important limitation for autologous transplantation in glioblastoma. In the present study, we evaluated the tumor targeting and antitumor activity of human skin-derived stem cells (hSDSCs) in human brain tumor models. The hSDSCs exhibit tumor targeting characteristics in vivo when injected into the controlateral hemisphere or into the tail vein of mice. When implanted directly into glioblastomas, hSDSCs distributed themselves extensively throughout the tumor mass, reduced tumor vessel density, and decreased angiogenic sprouts. In addition, transplanted hSDSCs differentiate into pericyte cell and release high amounts of human transforming growth factor-beta1 with low expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which may contribute to the decreased tumor cell invasion and number of tumor vessels. In long-term experiments, the hSDSCs were also able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to prolong animal survival. Similar behavior was seen when hSDSCs were implanted into two different tumor models, the chicken embryo experimental glioma model and the transgenic Tyrp1-Tag mice. Taken together, these data validate the use of hSDSCs for targeting human brain tumors.

"""Neoplastic Myelopathies.""","""Purpose of review: This article discusses the diagnosis and management of neoplasms that affect the spinal cord as well as spinal cord disorders that can occur due to cancer treatments. Recent findings: Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are IDH-mutant tumors, whereas only 10% of glioblastomas are IDH-mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically IDH-mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location. NF2 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome. Summary: Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers. The knowledge of the clinical features and management of neoplastic myelopathies is essential to practicing neurologists as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent devastating neurologic sequelae.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29613896

"""Prognostic Significance of Indicators of Systemic Inflammatory Responses in Glioblastoma Patients.""","""Background: High-grade gliomas, with glioblastomas as the most frequently observed histologic subtype, are the most common primary brain tumours in adults. It is considered that inflammatory responses play a major role in malignancies, including tumour progression. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the thrombocyte to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as indicators of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in glioblastoma patients. Methods: A total of 90 patients treated for glioblastoma were retrospectively evaluated. Absolute counts were used to generate NLR and PLR. A SIR was considered to be present with an NLR ≥5 and/or PLR ≥150. Results: Median follow-up time was 11.3 months (range: 1-70 months). The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 55.2% and 19.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that there was no correlation between overall survival and gender (p=0.184), comorbid disease (p = 0.30), clinical presentation (p = 0.884), or tumour lateralization (p = 0.159). Multivariate analysis showed that overall survival was significantly correlated with SIR based on NLR (HR: 2.41), and ECOG performance status (HR: 1.53). The prognostic factors that affected survival, other than SIR, were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (p = 0.003), and tumour localization (p = 0.006). Conclusion: The present findings confirm that NLR based on peripheral blood counts prior to treatment can be used as a prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma. Since tumour aggression increases and survival decreases as the NLR value rises, choice of treatment modality is facilitated for glioblastoma patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29286221

"""Negative prognostic effect of low nuclear GLI1 expression in glioblastomas.""","""The hedgehog signaling plays supportive roles in various aspects of tumorigenesis. Increased expression of the key component, GLI1, has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in many types of cancers. We aimed to investigate the effect of GLI1 expression in glioblastoma focusing on the nuclear localization. Immunohistochemistry for GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, SMO, and SHH were done in 140 glioblastoma tissues, and the staining was graded. For GLI1, nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was separately assessed. No significant correlation was found between clinicopathologic parameters and expression grades of the five proteins. Low nuclear GLI1 expression was associated with a worse progression-free survival while overall survival was not significantly affected. In contrast, cytoplasmic GLI1 expression did not have a prognostic effect. PTCH1 expression correlated with nuclear GLI1 expression without exerting a significant prognostic effect. Analysis of the TCGA-glioblastoma dataset revealed that low GLI1 mRNA level also correlated with a poor prognosis for both overall and progression-free survival. The adverse effect of low nuclear GLI1 expression in glioblastomas is in contrast with the negative prognostic effect of high GLI1 expression reported in non-cranial malignancies. The relative impact of hedgehog signaling among other oncogenic pathways in the brain may be responsible for the difference. The different implication of GLI1 expression in glioblastomas needs to be considered in studies of hedgehog signaling-targeted therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417299
"""Stem cell niches in glioblastoma: a neuropathological view.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs), responsible for tumor growth, recurrence, and resistance to therapies, are considered the real therapeutic target, if they had no molecular mechanisms of resistance, in comparison with the mass of more differentiated cells which are insensitive to therapies just because of being differentiated and nonproliferating. GSCs occur in tumor niches where both stemness status and angiogenesis are conditioned by the microenvironment. In both perivascular and perinecrotic niches, hypoxia plays a fundamental role. Fifteen glioblastomas have been studied by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for stemness and differentiation antigens. It has been found that circumscribed necroses develop inside hyperproliferating areas that are characterized by high expression of stemness antigens. Necrosis developed inside them because of the imbalance between the proliferation of tumor cells and endothelial cells; it reduces the number of GSCs to a thin ring around the former hyperproliferating area. The perinecrotic GSCs are nothing else that the survivors remnants of those populating hyperproliferating areas.

The clinical factors between cerebellar (n=10) and supratentorial (n=216) GBMs were compared. Additionally, p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels were investigated in six patients by immunostaining as well as the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) status of five patients by direct sequencing. Eight males and two females participated in the present study, the mean age at diagnosis was 56.6 years and the range 37-75 years. Four patients presented with hydrocephalus and one with brainstem involvement, and two patients were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1. Two patients had previously received radiotherapy, eight patients received postoperative radiotherapy and seven chemotherapy. The mean Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was lower in patients with cerebellar GBMs compared to those with supratentorial GBM; however, the survival times did not differ between the two groups. All of the cases of six cerebellar GBMs were p53‑positive and EGFR‑negative, as detected by immunostaining, consistent with secondary GBM. However, no IDH1 mutations were detected in any of the five cases of cerebellar GBMs analyzed, indicating that these tumors were not of the secondary type. The KPS score with cerebellar GBMs may be lower due to hydrocephalus, which was ameliorated by surgery but may have impacted the survival rate. It was confirmed that cerebellar GBMs were identical to supratentorial GBMs with respect to its clinical features, with the possible exception of the KPS score. The present study's genetic analyses indicated that cerebellar GBMs may develop via a pathway different from that of either primary or secondary GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25199771

"""Prognostic factors for survival in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma: a decision-tree-based model.""","""We assessed prognostic factors in relation to OS from progression in recurrent glioblastomas. Retrospective multicentric study enrolling 407 (training set) and 370 (external validation set) adult patients with a recurrent supratentorial glioblastoma treated by surgical resection and standard combined chemoradiotherapy as first-line treatment. Four complementary multivariate prognostic models were evaluated: Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, single-tree recursive partitioning, random survival forest, conditional random forest. Median overall survival from progression was 7.6 months (mean, 10.1; range, 0-86) and 8.0 months (mean, 8.5; range, 0-56) in the training and validation sets, respectively (p = 0.900). Using the Cox model in the training set, independent predictors of poorer overall survival from progression included increasing age at histopathological diagnosis (aHR, 1.47; 95% CI [1.03-2.08]; p = 0.032), RTOG-RPA V-VI classes (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI [1.11-1.73]; p = 0.004), decreasing KPS at progression (aHR, 3.46; 95% CI [2.10-5.72]; p < 0.001), while independent predictors of longer overall survival from progression included surgical resection (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI [0.44-0.73]; p < 0.001) and chemotherapy (aHR, 0.41; 95% CI [0.31-0.55]; p < 0.001). Single-tree recursive partitioning identified KPS at progression, surgical resection at progression, chemotherapy at progression, and RTOG-RPA class at histopathological diagnosis, as main survival predictors in the training set, yielding four risk categories highly predictive of overall survival from progression both in training (p < 0.0001) and validation (p < 0.0001) sets. Both random forest approaches identified KPS at progression as the most important survival predictor. Age, KPS at progression, RTOG-RPA classes, surgical resection at progression and chemotherapy at progression are prognostic for survival in recurrent glioblastomas and should inform the treatment decisions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29159777

Glioblastoma-activated pericytes develop an immunosuppressive phenotype, reducing T-cell activation through the induction of an anti-inflammatory response. Strikingly, pericytes support glioblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Here, we describe succinctly the results and implications of the findings reported in pericytes' and glioblastomas' biology.

"""Depatuxizumab Mafodotin (ABT-414)-induced Glioblastoma Cell Death Requires EGFR Overexpression, but not EGFR(Y1068) Phosphorylation.""","""Glioblastomas commonly (40%) exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification; half of these tumors carry the EGFRvIII deletion variant characterized by an in-frame deletion of exons 2-7, resulting in constitutive EGFR activation. Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors had only modest effects in glioblastoma, novel therapeutic agents targeting amplified EGFR or EGFRvIII continue to be developed.Depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) is an EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the mAb 806 and a toxic payload, monomethyl auristatin F. Because glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma-initiating cell models expressed too little EGFR in vitro to be ABT-414-sensitive, we generated glioma sublines overexpressing EGFR or EGFRvIII to explore determinants of ABT-414-induced cell death.Overexpression of EGFRvIII induces sensitization to ABT-414 more readily than overexpression of EGFR in vitro and in vivo Exposure to ABT-414 in vivo eliminated EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells, and recurrent tumors were devoid of EGFRvIII expression. There is no bystander killing of cells devoid of EGFR expression. Surprisingly, either exposure to EGF or to EGFR tyrosin kinase inhibitors reduce EGFR protein levels and are thus not strategies to promote ABT-414-induced cell killing. Furthermore, glioma cells overexpressing kinase-dead EGFR or EGFRvIII retain binding of mAb 806 and sensitivity to ABT-414, allowing to dissociate EGFR phosphorylation from the emergence of the 'active' EGFR conformation required for ABT-414 binding.The combination of EGFR-targeting antibody-drug conjugates with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors carries a high risk of failure.

"""Fibrin deposition in primary and metastatic human brain tumours.""","""Extravascular, intratumoral fibrin deposition is frequently observed within and around neoplastic tissue and has been implicated in various aspects of tumour growth. This is the first report on the presence and distribution of fibrinogen/fibrin in primary (14 glioblastomas) and metastatic (nine samples of lung cancer origin) human brain tumours detected by immunofluorescent techniques. All tissue samples showed specific staining for fibrinogen/fibrin. In glioblastomas fibrin deposits could be detected within and around tumour foci, while in metastatic brain tumours the tumour cell nodules were surrounded by fibrin deposits localized almost exclusively in the connective tissue compartment of tumours. Double-labelling reactions for von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen/fibrin has revealed that fibrin deposition occurred throughout the tumour stroma independently of tumour vasculature. The overlapping reactions for fibrinogen/fibrin and factor XIII subunit A, as well as the urea-insolubility of the deposits indicate the crosslinked, highly stabilized nature of fibrin both within and around tumours. Staining with Ki M7 monoclonal antibody specific for phagocytosing macrophages showed these cells to be scattered in the nonnecrotic areas in glioblastomas and to be accumulated at the interface of tumorous parenchyma and connective tissue in both primary and metastatic tumours. The close association between fibrin deposition and macrophage accumulation strongly suggests the active participation of tumour associated macrophages in the formation of stabilized intratumoral fibrin network in human brain neoplasms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8874864
"""Radiomics and visual analysis for predicting success of transplantation of heterotopic glioblastoma in mice with MRI.""","""Background: Quantifying tumor growth and treatment response noninvasively poses a challenge to all experimental tumor models. The aim of our study was, to assess the value of quantitative and visual examination and radiomic feature analysis of high-resolution MR images of heterotopic glioblastoma xenografts in mice to determine tumor cell proliferation (TCP). Methods: Human glioblastoma cells were injected subcutaneously into both flanks of immunodeficient mice and followed up on a 3 T MR scanner. Volumes and signal intensities were calculated. Visual assessment of the internal tumor structure was based on a scoring system. Radiomic feature analysis was performed using MaZda software. The results were correlated with histopathology and immunochemistry. Results: 21 tumors in 14 animals were analyzed. The volumes of xenografts with high TCP (H-TCP) increased, whereas those with low TCP (L-TCP) or no TCP (N-TCP) continued to decrease over time (p < 0.05). A low intensity rim (rim sign) on unenhanced T1-weighted images provided the highest diagnostic accuracy at visual analysis for assessing H-TCP (p < 0.05). Applying radiomic feature analysis, wavelet transform parameters were best for distinguishing between H-TCP and L-TCP / N-TCP (p < 0.05).

"""NIR-IIb Fluorescence Molecular Tomography of Glioblastomas Based on Heterogeneous Mouse Models and Adaptive Projection Match Pursuit Method.""","""Objective: Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) using fluorescence of the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) has been proved to outperform conventional FMT using fluorescence of the first near-infrared window (NIR-I). However, it was still a challenge to achieve a satisfactory reconstructed light source using NIR-II FMT as the NIR-IIa (1300-1400 nm) fluorescence in the NIR-II spectrum used in the previous NIR-II FMT study was still suffering from prominent absorption and scattering of tissue. Methods: A novel NIR-IIb (1500-1700 nm) FMT method was proposed and applied in the reconstruction of glioblastomas in animal models. Optical parameters that describe the effect of different tissue on the NIR-IIb photons were calculated to construct a light propagation model of NIR-IIb light to form the forward model. Besides, a novel adaptive projection matching pursuit (APMP) method was further adopted to accurately solve the inverse problem. Location error and Dice coefficient were used to evaluate the accuracy of reconstruction. Simulation experiments using single-source and dual-source and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the reconstructed light source. Results: Both simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrated that NIR-IIb FMT achieved reduced location error and improved shape similarity compared with NIR-IIa. NIR-IIb FMT of orthotopic mouse models further achieved a location error of 0.65 mm and a Dice coefficient of 0.56, which both outperformed NIR-IIa. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that NIR-IIb has better reconstruction performance for positioning accuracy and shape recovery.

"""Chronophin is a glial tumor modifier involved in the regulation of glioblastoma growth and invasiveness.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Although the rapid recurrence of glioblastomas after treatment is a major clinical challenge, the relationships between tumor growth and intracerebral spread remain poorly understood. We have identified the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (gene name: pyridoxal phosphatase, PDXP) as a glial tumor modifier. Monoallelic PDXP loss was frequent in four independent human astrocytic tumor cohorts and increased with tumor grade. We found that aberrant PDXP promoter methylation can be a mechanism leading to further chronophin downregulation in glioblastomas, which correlated with shorter glioblastoma patient survival. Moreover, we observed an inverse association between chronophin protein expression and cofilin phosphorylation levels in glioma tissue samples. Chronophin-deficient glioblastoma cells showed elevated cofilin phosphorylation, an increase in polymerized actin, a higher directionality of cell migration, and elevated in vitro invasiveness. Tumor growth of chronophin-depleted glioblastoma cells xenografted into the immunodeficient mouse brain was strongly impaired. Our study suggests a mechanism whereby the genetic and epigenetic alterations of PDXP resulting in altered chronophin expression may regulate the interplay between glioma cell proliferation and invasion.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26549022

We therefore studied angiogenesis in 25 patients: 14 with glioblastoma multiforme and 11 with grade I meningioma. Our aim was to assess how angiogenesis conditions growth and necrosis. The patients underwent MRI with standard and perfusion sequences. We calculated the volume of each tumour; for the glioblastomas the solid portion was taken as the difference between the overall volume and the volume of any necrotic portion. In the glioblastomas, we found an inverse relationship between blood volume and the size of the tumour, whereas in the meningiomas there was of a direct relationship. These correlations confirm in vivo the knowledge about necrosis in glioblastomas and its relationship to their inadequate vascular network. On the contrary, grade 1 meningiomas show an equilibrium between their microcirculation and the cellular component.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12687302
"""Contribution of diffusion tensor imaging to delineation of gliomas and glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To determine if the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) can differentiate between accompanying edema and tumor cell infiltration of white matter (WM) beyond the tumor edge as defined from conventional MRI in low- and high-grade gliomas. Materials and methods: We examined 12 patients with high-grade gliomas/glioblastomas and eight patients with low-grade gliomas and compared them to 10 patients with meningiomas, in which no tumor infiltration is expected. The tumor was defined as the enhancing area in glioblastomas and meningiomas and as the area of increased T2-signal in low-grade gliomas. FA and MD were measured in the center of the tumor and in the adjacent WM. The contralateral WM and internal capsule were used as an internal standard. Results: Comparing the WM areas of increased T2-signal adjacent to meningiomas and glioblastomas, we saw a trend (without significance) towards a reduction of FA, but not of MD, in glioblastomas. We found no changes of FA and MD in the WM adjacent to low-grade gliomas (without T2-signal increase) compared to the WM of the contralateral hemisphere. In meningiomas and high-grade gliomas/glioblastomas, a narrow rim of significantly (P < 0.01) increased FA and decreased MD values around the enhancing tumor area was seen, whereas in low-grade gliomas, such a rim could not be defined. There was no contribution of FA or MD to grading of gliomas. Conclusion: In glioblastomas, a reduction of FA in the edematous area surrounding the tumor may indicate tumor cell infiltration, but a reliable differentiation between infiltration and vasogenic edema is not yet possible on the basis of DTI. The additional finding of a narrow rim of increased FA and decreased MD at the edge of glioblastomas (as well as in meningiomas) may be caused by com-pressed WM fibers and/or increased vascularity, but does not contribute to exclude peripheral cellular infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15558549
"""Epigenetic regulation of cancer stem cell and tumorigenesis.""","""As a unique subpopulation of cancer cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs) acquire the resistance to conventional therapies and appear to be the prime cause of cancer recurrence. Like their normal counterparts, CSCs can renew themselves and generate differentiated progenies. Cancer stem cells are distinguished among heterogenous cancer cells by molecular markers and their capacity of efficiently forming new tumors composed of diverse and heterogenous cancer cells. Tumor heterogeneity can be inter- or intra-tumor, molecularly resulting from the accumulation of genetic and non-genetic alterations. Non-genetic alterations are mainly changes on epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone, and chromatin remodeling. As tumor-initiating cells and contributing to the tumor heterogeneity in the brain, glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) attract extensive research interests. Epigenetic modifications confer on tumor cells including CSCs reversible and inheritable genomic changes and affect gene expression without alteration in DNA sequence.

In this work we present ONCOhabitats (https://www.oncohabitats.upv.es): an online open access system for glioblastoma analysis based on MRI data. Methods: ONCOhabitats provides two main services for untreated glioblastomas: (1) malignant tissue segmentation, and (2) vascular heterogeneity assessment of the tumor. The segmentation service implements a deep patch-wise 3D Convolutional Neural Network with residual connections. The vascular heterogeneity assessment service implements the Hemodynamic Tissue Signature (HTS) method patented in P201431289, which aims to identify habitats within the tumor with early prognostic capabilities. Results: The segmentation service was validated against the BRATS 2017 reference dataset, showing comparable results with current state-of-the-art methods (whole tumor Dice segmentation: 0.89). The vascular heterogeneity assessment service was validated in a retrospective cohort of 50 patients, in a study focused on predicting patient overall survival based on the HTS habitats. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival study showed significant positive correlations (p-value <.05) between the HTS habitats and patient overall survival. ONCOhabitats system also generates radiological reports for each service, including volumetries and perfusion measurements of the different regions of the lesion. Conclusion: ONCOhabitats system provides open-access services for glioblastoma heterogeneity assessment, implementing consolidated state-of-the-art techniques for medical image analysis.

This complex plays a crucial role in driving immune cell infiltration and tumour growth by establishing a feedback loop between cancer and immune cells, intensifying cancer aggressiveness. Targeting this complex with blood-brain barrier-permeable small molecules improved treatment efficacy, disrupting cell communication and impeding cancer cell survival and stem-like properties.

We showed also the central necrosis of glioblastoma accompanied by the tissue hypoxia, which were apparent as increased lactate and lipids ratios (↑ Lac/tCr and lip/Lac). Metabolic changes were noticeable also in the peritumoral area, showing the glioblastoma infiltration into the surrounding tissues.

"""Molecular characterization of long-term survivors of glioblastoma using genome- and transcriptome-wide profiling.""","""The prognosis of glioblastoma, the most malignant type of glioma, is still poor, with only a minority of patients showing long-term survival of more than three years after diagnosis. To elucidate the molecular aberrations in glioblastomas of long-term survivors, we performed genome- and/or transcriptome-wide molecular profiling of glioblastoma samples from 94 patients, including 28 long-term survivors with >36 months overall survival (OS), 20 short-term survivors with <12 months OS and 46 patients with intermediate OS. Integrative bioinformatic analyses were used to characterize molecular aberrations in the distinct survival groups considering established molecular markers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutations, and O(6) -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Patients with long-term survival were younger and more often had IDH1/2-mutant and MGMT-methylated tumors. Gene expression profiling revealed over-representation of a distinct (proneural-like) expression signature in long-term survivors that was linked to IDH1/2 mutation. However, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas from long-term survivors did not show distinct gene expression profiles and included proneural, classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma subtypes. Genomic imbalances also differed between IDH1/2-mutant and IDH1/2-wildtype tumors, but not between survival groups of IDH1/2-wildtype patients. Thus, our data support an important role for MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/2 mutation in glioblastoma long-term survival and corroborate the association of IDH1/2 mutation with distinct genomic and transcriptional profiles. Importantly, however, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas in our cohort of long-term survivors lacked distinctive DNA copy number changes and gene expression signatures, indicating that other factors might have been responsible for long survival in this particular subgroup of patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24615357

"""Metformin repositioning as antitumoral agent: selective antiproliferative effects in human glioblastoma stem cells, via inhibition of CLIC1-mediated ion current.""","""Epidemiological and preclinical studies propose that metformin, a first-line drug for type-2 diabetes, exerts direct antitumor activity. Although several clinical trials are ongoing, the molecular mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here we show that chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) is a direct target of metformin in human glioblastoma cells. Metformin exposure induces antiproliferative effects in cancer stem cell-enriched cultures, isolated from three individual WHO grade IV human glioblastomas. These effects phenocopy metformin-mediated inhibition of a chloride current specifically dependent on CLIC1 functional activity. CLIC1 ion channel is preferentially active during the G1-S transition via transient membrane insertion. Metformin inhibition of CLIC1 activity induces G1 arrest of glioblastoma stem cells. This effect was time-dependent, and prolonged treatments caused antiproliferative effects also for low, clinically significant, metformin concentrations. Furthermore, substitution of Arg29 in the putative CLIC1 pore region impairs metformin modulation of channel activity. The lack of drugs affecting cancer stem cell viability is the main cause of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We identified CLIC1 not only as a modulator of cell cycle progression in human glioblastoma stem cells but also as the main target of metformin's antiproliferative activity, paving the way for novel and needed pharmacological approaches to glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25361004

Precise targeting by whole-brain spectroscopic MRI, which maps tumor metabolites including choline (Cho) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), can quantify early treatment-induced molecular changes that other traditional modalities cannot measure. We developed a pipeline to determine how spectroscopic MRI changes during early RT are associated with patient outcomes to provide insight into the utility of adaptive RT planning. Data were obtained from a study (NCT03137888) where glioblastoma patients received high-dose RT guided by the pre-RT Cho/NAA twice normal (Cho/NAA ≥ 2x) volume, and received spectroscopic MRI scans pre- and mid-RT. Overlap statistics between pre- and mid-RT scans were used to quantify metabolic activity changes after two weeks of RT.

Recent findings: We and others are using dendritic cells to present glioblastoma antigens (whole tumor lysate) to the immune system; our initial data indicate that clinical benefit is associated to increased presence of natural killer cells in the periphery. A pilot study loading dendritic cells with glioblastoma stem-like cells will start soon. Peptide vaccination targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) epitope, present in 25% of glioblastomas, is ongoing. Intriguing results have been obtained by vaccination with three other peptides in pediatric gliomas. Another clinical trial is targeting EGFRvIII by adoptive cell transfer of chimeric antigen receptor. This exciting technology could be suited for a number of other potential epitopes discovered through next-generation sequencing. Finally, antibodies against the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1, which demonstrated efficacy in advanced melanomas, will be used in novel trials for recurrent glioblastoma.

Fusion of features from the edematous subregions of multiple MRI sequences by the RFO model resulted in differentiation between grade 4 astrocytoma and glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38305926
"""Extent of tumor-brain interface: a new tool to predict evolution of malignant gliomas.""","""Object: Tumor size is one of the features commonly used in oncology to predict disease evolution. However, for most primary brain tumors it is not predictive of outcome. Taking advantage of a gene therapy trial in which recurrences of glioblastoma were targeted with suicide genes, the authors developed a new parameter: the extent of tumor-brain interface--also called surface of tumor volume (STV)--to better describe three-dimensional conformation and the relationship between tumors and the surrounding normal tissue. Correlations between the STV and the usual clinical parameters were analyzed. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, 16 patients presenting with recurrent glioblastomas were enrolled in this study. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were analyzed on a separate workstation; the interface between tumor and normal brain tissue was measured on each 3-mm-thick section to assess STV. The mean STV was 29.2 cm2, and the mean tumor volume (TV) was 23.8 cm3. The STV was significantly correlated with survival (Spearman test: r = -0.54, p = 0.03), but TV was not (Spearman test: r = -0.39, p = 0.15). A separate analysis of responding and nonresponding patients showed that, as expected, STV was negatively correlated with survival among nonresponding patients (p = 0.04), but that among responding patients there was a positive tendency between STV and survival. Conclusions: These findings indicate that STV may be a useful tool for predicting the evolution of malignant glioma. Moreover, in future gene therapy trials in which such in situ approaches are used, increasing density and improved distribution of transfer cells should be taken into consideration as an important issue for efficacy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11235948
"""In Silico Analysis Identifies Upregulated lncRNA DLGAP1-AS1 Which Is Correlated to Poor Prognosis and Promotes Cell Proliferation in Glioblastoma.""","""Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to regulate the tumorigenesis, growth, and metastasis of glioblastomas. In this study, we identified 1623 differently expressed mRNAs and 38 lncRNAs utilizing the CGGA and TCGA databases. Among these mRNAs and lncRNAs, we focused on DLGAP1-AS1 in this study. The results demonstrated that DLGAP1-AS1 was higher in WHO IV glioma than in WHO II and WHO III gliomas, higher in WHO III glioma than in WHO II glioma samples, higher in IDH1 wildtype glioma than in IDH1-mutant glioma samples, and higher in 1p/19q noncodeletion glioma than in 1p/19q codeletion glioma samples. Moreover, we observed that higher expression levels of DLGAP1-AS1 were correlated to shorter OS time in both low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Next, we evaluated the function of DLGAP1-AS1 in GBM using in vivo experiments. The data revealed that DLGAP1-AS1 knockdown greatly hindered U87 cell and U251 cell proliferation. Using coexpression network analysis, we identified that ATG4A was a potential downstream target of DLGAP1-AS1. The further analysis showed that ATG4B was significantly upregulated and correlated to shorter OS time in gliomas using both the CGGA and TCGA databases. Finally, we showed that ablated ATG4B greatly hindered GBM cell proliferation. Our conclusion suggested that DLGAP1-AS1 may be a potential prognosis biomarker and facilitated the occurrence and development of glioma via ATG4A in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35341001
"""Longitudinal, leakage corrected and uncorrected rCBV during the first-line treatment of glioblastoma: a prospective study.""","""Purpose: Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR-perfusion is becoming a standard of care for the monitoring of glioblastoma. Yet, technical standards are lacking and measurements without leakage correction are still common. Also, data on leakage corrected measurements during stable disease is scarce. In this study we hypothesized that basic leakage correction would significantly enhance data quality during stable disease and improve progress detection. We furthermore investigated whether longitudinal data could increase diagnostic performance. Methods: Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma undergoing first-line therapy were prospectively recruited. We conducted DSC perfusion measurements without prebolus administration in 6-week intervals from the end of radiotherapy until progression. Maximum relative cerebral volume values (rCBVmax) with and without leakage correction were calculated using Philips IntelliSpace®. Results: We recruited 16 patients and conducted 82 MRI scans with a mean follow up of 7.2 month. During stable disease, corrected rCBVmax was significantly more stable than uncorrected rCBVmax. Detection of progression with a rCBVmax cutoff was better for corrected (specificity 86%) than for uncorrected rCBVmax (specificity 41%). Interestingly, the increase of corrected rCBVmax upon progression also had a good diagnostic performance with a combination of both cutoffs delivering the best result (sensitivity/specificity 89%/93%). Conclusion: Corrected rCBVmax supports the imaging finding of a stable disease and large increases during longitudinal observation support the diagnosis of tumor progression. rCBV values without prebolus or leakage correction are not reliable to monitor glioblastomas. Further studies to investigate the value of longitudinal rCBV dynamics for the differentiation of real tumor progression from pseudoprogression are warranted.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31321614
"""Overexpression of cytosolic, plasma membrane bound and extracellular heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in primary glioblastomas.""","""A unique feature in several non-CNS-tumors is the overexpression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70, HSPA1A) in the cytosol, but also its unusual plasma membrane expression and release. Although in gliomas, cytosolic Hsp70 levels are not associated with histological grading, the role of membrane bound and released Hsp70 is still completely unknown. Membrane bound as well as cytosolic Hsp70 can be detected in viable tumor cells with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) cmHsp70.1. Herein, we analysed membrane bound Hsp70 levels in primary and secondary gliomas of different grades and on isolated glioma subpopulations (endothelial cells, CD133-positive cells, primary cultures) by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry using cmHsp70.1 mAb. Extracellular Hsp70 was determined by a commercial Hsp70 sandwich ELISA (R&D) in plasma samples of glioblastoma patients and healthy volunteers. We found an overexpression of Hsp70 in primary glioblastomas compared to low-grade, anaplastic, or secondary gliomas as determined by immunohistochemistry. Especially in flow cytometry, a strong plasma membrane Hsp70 expression was only observed in primary but not secondary glioblastomas. Within the heterogeneous tumor mass, CD133-positive tumor-initiating and primary glioblastoma cells showed a high membrane Hsp70 expression density, whereas endothelial cells, isolated from glioblastoma tissues only showed a weak staining pattern. Also in plasma samples, secreted Hsp70 protein was significantly increased in patients harbouring primary glioblastomas compared to those with secondary and low grade glioblastomas. Taken together, we show for the first time that cytosolic, membrane bound and extracellular Hsp70 is uniquely overexpressed in primary glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28849427

"""Simultaneous alterations of retinoblastoma and p53 protein expression in astrocytic tumors.""","""The genetic alterations frequently involved in glial malignancies are in the tumor suppressor genes, Rb and p53. An altered Rb expression or p53 overexpression is thought to indicate defective tumor suppression and subsequently more aggressive tumors. Therefore, to assess the alterations in the conjoint expression of Rb and p53 proteins in formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections, 64 astrocytic tumors were studied (16 astrocytomas,7 gemistocytic astrocytomas, 19 anaplastic astrocytomas and 22 glioblastomas) using the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Fifty two cases (81.25%) were found to be positive for p53 protein. Seventeen of these showed aberrant heterogenous staining for pRb, of which 7 were glioblastomas. Only one case of astrocytoma showed aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb. Thus, of the 64 tumors, simultaneous aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb was seen in 21.9% of cases. This was more commonly observed among glioblastoma cases (7/22). No statistical difference was found between the survival rate of heterogenous pRb and p53 positivity in different grades of tumors. In glioblastomas, the survival rate appeared to be less in patients expressing heterogenous pRb, but this was not statistically significant. These results lead us to suspect that p53 and pRb pathways are inactivated, either through mutation or as part of the neoplastic process in astrocytic tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10079373
"""Current status and recent advances in reirradiation of glioblastoma.""","""Despite aggressive management consisting of maximal safe surgical resection followed by external beam radiation therapy (60 Gy/30 fractions) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide, approximately 90% of WHO grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas, GBM) will recur locally within 2 years. For patients with recurrent GBM, no standard of care exists. Thanks to the continuous improvement in radiation science and technology, reirradiation has emerged as feasible approach for patients with brain tumors. Using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), either hypofractionated or conventionally fractionated schedules, several studies have suggested survival benefits following reirradiation of patients with recurrent GBM; however, there are still questions to be answered about the efficacy and toxicity associated with a second course of radiation. We provide a clinical overview on current status and recent advances in reirradiation of GBM, addressing relevant clinical questions such as the appropriate patient selection and radiation technique, optimal dose fractionation, reirradiation tolerance of the brain and the risk of radiation necrosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602305
"""Immune cell infiltrates in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.""","""Objective: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Its pathogenesis remains unknown. Like glioblastomas, AT/RTs contain brain cancer stem cells (CSCs) that suppress the immunity of patients and are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Considerable infiltration of immune cells, including macrophages/microglia, dendritic cells and T-cells, has been noted in glioblastomas, which correlates with poor prognosis. The present study examines the significance of infiltrating immune cells in four cases of AT/RT; including one associated with an autoimmune disease, Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Methods: Tumor tissues from four patients with AT/RT were analyzed and compared with those from four patients with glioblastomas. The frequency of immune cells, including CD68+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, was assessed by scoring for statistical analysis. Results: The infiltration of immune cells was identified in the case of AT/RT associated with HSP and three other cases of infratentorial AT/RTs. Moderate infiltration of CD68+ macrophages/microglia and CD4+ cells was noted in AT/RTs with no significant difference from that in glioblastomas (p > 0.05). However, the infiltration of CD8+ T-cells was significantly higher in AT/RTs than that in glioblastomas (p < 0.05); CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly lower in AT/RTs than that in glioblastomas (p < 0.05). In addition, eosinophils were found in all AT/RTs, but not in glioblastomas. Conclusions: These findings suggest an immune microenvironment of AT/RTs with more immune effectors than glioblastomas. Our observation contributes to understanding the growth environment of AT/RTs for which adjuvant immunotherapy may be potentially beneficial.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22931701
"""ALK signaling cascade confers multiple advantages to glioblastoma cells through neovascularization and cell proliferation.""","""Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase, is essentially and transiently expressed in the developing nervous system. Here we examined the functional role of the ALK gene in glioblastomas (GBMs). In clinical samples of GBMs, high ALK expression without gene rearrangements or mutations was frequently observed in perivascular lesions, in contrast to the relatively low expression in the perinecrotic areas, which was positively correlated with N-myc and phosphorylated (p) Stat3 scores and Ki-67 labeling indices. ALK immunoreactivity was also found to be associated with neovascular features including vascular co-option and vascular mimicry. In astrocytoma cell lines, cells stably overexpressing full-length ALK showed an increase in expression of pStat3 and pAkt proteins, as well as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) mRNAs, in contrast to cells with knockdown of endogenous ALK which showed decreased expression of these molecules. Transfection of the constitutively active form of Stat3 induced an increase in HIF-1α promoter activity, and the overexpression of HIF-1α in turn resulted in enhancement of VEGF-A promoter activity. In addition, cells with overexpression or knockdown of ALK also showed a tendency toward increased and decreased proliferation, respectively, through changes in expression of pAkt and pStat3. Finally, ALK promoter was significantly activated by transfection of Sox4 and N-myc, which are known to contribute to neuronal properties. These findings therefore suggest that N-myc/Sox4-mediated ALK signaling cascades containing Stat3, Akt, HIF-1α, and VEGF-A confer multiple advantages to tumor growth through alterations in neovascularization and cell proliferation in GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837676

"""MicroRNA-125b-2 confers human glioblastoma stem cells resistance to temozolomide through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.""","""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. miR-125b, one of the neuronal miRNAs, was recently found to be necessary for stem cell fission and for making stem cells insensitive to chemotherapy signals. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastomas. However, resistance develops quickly and with a high frequency. Given the insensitivity of some glioblastomas to TMZ and the hypothesis that glioma stem cells cause resistance to drug therapy, exploring the functions and mechanisms of miR-125b action on TMZ-treated glioblastoma stem cells would be valuable. In this study, we found that miR-125b-2 is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme tissues and the corresponding stem cells (GBMSC); downregulation of miR-125b-2 expression in GBMSC could allow TMZ to induce GBMSC apoptosis. Additionally, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased after the TMZ+miR-125b-2 inhibitor treatment, while the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax was increased. Further research demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis in GBMSC is also associated with increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria, induction of Apaf-1, activation of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-125b-2 overexpression might confer glioblastoma stem cells resistance to TMZ.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879257
"""Proteomic analysis of glioblastomas: what is the best brain control sample?""","""Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent and aggressive tumor of the central nervous system. There is currently growing interest in proteomic studies of GB, particularly with the aim of identifying new prognostic or therapeutic response markers. However, comparisons between different proteomic analyses of GB have revealed few common differentiated proteins. The types of control samples used to identify such proteins may in part explain the different results obtained. We therefore tried to determine which control samples would be most suitable for GB proteomic studies. We used an isotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL) method followed by mass spectrometry to reveal and compare the protein patterns of two commonly used types of control sample: GB peritumoral brain zone samples (PBZ) from six patients and epilepsy surgery brain samples (EB) pooled from three patients. The data obtained were processed using AMEN software for network analysis. We identified 197 non-redundant proteins and 35 of them were differentially expressed. Among these 35 differentially expressed proteins, six were over-expressed in PBZ and 29 in EB, showing different proteomic patterns between the two samples. Surprisingly, EB appeared to display a tumoral-like expression pattern in comparison to PBZ. In our opinion, PBZ may be more appropriate control sample for GB proteomic analysis. Biological significance: This manuscript describes an original study in which we used an isotope-coded protein labeling method followed by mass spectrometry to identify and compare the protein patterns in two types of sample commonly used as control for glioblastoma (GB) proteomic analysis: peritumoral brain zone and brain samples obtained during surgery for epilepsy.

Methods: The cohort consisted of 98 adult glioblastomas. A standard brain tumor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol, was performed on a 3T MR scanner. Visually Accessible REMBRANDT Images (VASARI) features were assessed. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by a log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the effects of VASARI features along with the age, gender, the extent of resection, pre- and post-KPS, ki67 and P53 mutation status on overall survival. Supervised machine learning algorithms were employed to predict the survival of glioblastoma patients based on 12, 19, and 24 months thresholds. Results: Tumor location (p<0.001), the proportion of non-enhancing component (p=0.0482), and proportion of necrosis (p=0.02) were significantly associated with overall survival based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that increases in proportion of non-enhancing component (p=0.040) and proportion of necrosis (p=0.039) were significantly associated with overall survival. Machine-learning models were successful in differentiating patients living longer than 12 months with 96.40% accuracy (sensitivity=97.22%, specificity=95.55%).

"""Cluster-based prognostication in glioblastoma: Unveiling heterogeneity based on diffusion and perfusion similarities.""","""Background: While the association between diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and survival in glioblastoma is established, prognostic models for patients are lacking. This study employed clustering of functional imaging to identify distinct functional phenotypes in untreated glioblastomas, assessing their prognostic significance for overall survival. Methods: A total of 289 patients with glioblastoma who underwent preoperative multimodal MR imaging were included. Mean values of apparent diffusion coefficient normalized relative cerebral blood volume and relative cerebral blood flow were calculated for different tumor compartments and the entire tumor. Distinct imaging patterns were identified using partition around medoids (PAM) clustering on the training dataset, and their ability to predict overall survival was assessed. Additionally, tree-based machine-learning models were trained to ascertain the significance of features pertaining to cluster membership. Results: Using the training dataset (231/289) we identified 2 stable imaging phenotypes through PAM clustering with significantly different overall survival (OS). Validation in an independent test set revealed a high-risk group with a median OS of 10.2 months and a low-risk group with a median OS of 26.6 months (P = 0.012). Patients in the low-risk cluster had high diffusion and low perfusion values throughout, while the high-risk cluster displayed the reverse pattern. Including cluster membership in all multivariate Cox regression analyses improved performance (P ≤ 0.004 each).

Because CRABP-II and FABP5 mediate RA intracellular signaling respectively and lead to distinct biological consequences, their expression patterns in different grades of astrocytomas and the glioblastoma cells lines LN18, LN428 and U251 were examined to identify potential correlations with RA sensitivities. The response of glioblastoma cells to RA, decitabine or the FABP5 competitive inhibitor, BMS309403, was analyzed. CRABP-II and FABP5 were expressed to varying degrees by the 84-astrocytoma cases examined. Treatment of LN428, U251 and LN18 cells with RA failed to suppress their growth; however, U251 proliferation was inhibited by decitabine. The combination of decitabine and RA suppressed the growth of all three cell lines and induced significant apoptosis of LN428 and U251 cells. Both CRABP-II and FABP5 were transcribed in the three cell lines but FABP5 proteins were undetectable in U251 cells. The ratio of CRABP-II to FABP5 was not altered after RA, decitabine or RA and decitabine treatment and the resistance of cells to RA was not reversed by BMS309403 treatment. In conclusion, CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns are neither related to the tumor grades nor correlated with RA sensitivity. Additional molecular factors may be present that determines the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to RA.

Human gliomas synthesize and secrete increased levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) as well as expressing increased numbers of IGF receptors when compared to normal brain tissue. These observations suggest the existence of an IGF-mediated autocrine mechanism for glioma growth regulation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of human recombinant IGF (hrIGF) treatment on the in vitro growth of human glioma monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid cultures. The data demonstrate that hrIGF-I treatment of glioma cell lines slightly enhanced tumor monolayer proliferation as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. In contrast, treatment of glioma spheroids with hrIGF-I or hrDes(1-3)IGF-I, the truncated brain form of IGF-I, dramatically enhanced 3D tumor growth with a 1.5-2-fold reduction in spheroid doubling time (FRSDT). In addition, IGF-treated glioma spheroids were more densely packed than spheroids grown in media alone with no observed necrosis. These data suggest that IGFs will dramatically enhance glioma proliferation when 3D cell-cell contact occurs. This observed enhancement suggests that IGFs both synthesized in the brain and systemically support rapid proliferation of gliomas in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9097982

Beside others, they achieve their progressive character via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, comprehensive investigations on EMT in paired primary-recurrent glioblastoma pairs are presently not available. Thus, in our present study we examined the expression profile of different EMT-markers in 17 matched primary and recurrent glioblastomas by qPCR and double-immunofluorescence stainings to identify EMT marker expressing cell types. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of temozolomide on EMT marker expression in vitro. In comparison to primary tumors, expression of β-catenin (p<0.05), Snail1 (p<0.05), Snail2/Slug (p<0.05), biglycan (p<0.05) and Twist1 (p<0.01) was downregulated in recurrence whereas L1CAM showed upregulation (p<0.05; qPCR). Expression of desmoplakin, vimentin, fibronectin and TGF-β1 with its receptors TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2 was almost unchanged. Comparing each individual pair, five different 'EMT groups' within our glioblastoma collective were identified according to the regulation of mRNA expression of GFAP, desmoplakin, Snail1, Snail2, Twist1 and vimentin. Additionally, double-stainings of EMT markers in combination with cell specific markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD11b, von Willebrand factor) revealed that EMT markers were expressed in a complex pattern with all three cellular types as possible sources. Temozolomide treatment significantly induced mRNA expression of nearly all investigated EMT markers in T98G glioma cells.

The cellular heterogeneity of glioblastomas is manifest in genetic and epigenetic variation with both stochastic and hierarchical models informing cellular phenotypes. At the apex of the hierarchy is a self-renewing, tumorigenic, cancer stem cell (CSC). The significance of CSCs is underscored by their resistance to cytotoxic therapies, invasive potential, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, targeting CSCs may offer therapeutic benefit and sensitize tumors to conventional treatment, demanding elucidation of CSC regulation. Attention has been paid to intrinsic cellular systems in CSCs, but recognition of extrinsic factors is evolving. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are enriched in functional niches--prominently the perivascular space and hypoxic regions. These niches provide instructive cues to maintain GSCs and induce cellular plasticity towards a stem-like phenotype.

For patients with disease progression after frontline therapy, there is no standard of care, although further surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy may be used. Antiangiogenic therapies may be appropriate for treating glioblastomas because angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth. In a large, noncomparative phase II trial, bevacizumab was evaluated alone and with irinotecan in patients with recurrent glioblastoma; combination treatment was associated with an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 50.3%, a median overall survival of 8.9 months, and a response rate of 37.8%. Single-agent bevacizumab also exceeded the predetermined threshold of activity for salvage chemotherapy (6-month PFS rate, 15%), achieving a 6-month PFS rate of 42.6% (p < 0.0001). On the basis of these results and those from another phase II trial, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of single-agent bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma that has progressed following prior therapy. Potential antiangiogenic agents-such as cilengitide and XL184-also show evidence of single-agent activity in recurrent glioblastoma. Moreover, the use of antiangiogenic agents with radiation at disease progression may improve the therapeutic ratio of single-modality approaches.

To reverse its radioresistance is important for improving prognosis. Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) have been proven to have anti-tumor effects, yet the knowledge of their influences on glioblastomas is still limited. Methods: The cytotoxic effects of GSI-I (a tripeptide GSI) on glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 were assessed by MTT assay, and the low concentration that did not induce significant cell death was determined. The in vitro radiosensitization effects of this low concentration of GSI-I were evaluated by cell colony forming assays. The CD133+ cell fractions before and after radiation with or without treatment of GSI-I were analyzed by flow cytometry. Then CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), and the radiosensitization effects of GSI-I on the two cell subtypes were investigated separately. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of GSI-I on CD133+and CD133- glioblastoma cells were examined, respectively, and the expression of the Notch pathway components between the two cell subtypes were compared. In addition, the anti-tumor effects of GSI-I were confirmed by in vivo experiments. Results: GSI-I at a low concentration sensitized U87 and U251 cells to radiation by depletion of radioresistant CD133+ cells. CD133+ U87/U251 cells displayed preferential sensitivity to low concentrations of GSI-I, which may be related to the higher expression of the Notch signaling pathway in these cells.

Genetic ablation of either isoform delays tumor progression in mice, but only ablating both isoforms completely blocks GBM driven by the concurrent ablation of Pten and p53. BKM120 (buparlisib) treatment only modestly prolongs survival in mice bearing intracranial Pten/p53 null tumors due to partial pathway inhibition. BKM120 extends the survival of mice bearing intracranial tumors in which p110β, but not p110α, has been genetically ablated in the Pten/p53 null glioma, indicating that BKM120 fails to inhibit p110β effectively. Our study suggests that the failure of PI3K inhibitors in GBM may be due to insufficient inhibition of p110β and indicates a need to develop brain-penetrant p110α/β inhibitors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997991
"""Variable efficiency of the thymidine kinase/ganciclovir system in human glioblastoma cell lines: implications for gene therapy.""","""The gene therapy strategy using the hsvl-thymidine kinase gene (TK) and ganciclovir (GCV) injections that has been used for treating human glioblastomas has not been as effective as expected after the first animal experiments. A better understanding of the different steps involved in this treatment, like gene transfer, gene expression, and sensitivity of the recipient cells, is needed. After proposing sensitivity criteria for the TK/GCV system and for the bystander effect, based on the levels of GCV that can be reached in vivo, we studied seven human glioblastoma cell lines (U87, U118, U251, SNB19, SNB75, SF295, SF539) for their sensitivity to the TK/GCV system. We also studied their in vitro bystander effect and their in vitro transfectability using LipofectAMINE as a transfection enhancer. Among six human glioblastoma cell lines stably transfected with the TK gene, five were sensitive to TK/GCV, and two had a good in vitro bystander effect. The in vitro transfectability of the cell lines tested was low (< or = 1%) compared to that of an established animal cell line, C6 rat glioma, in which 20-30% of the cells can be transfected routinely. According to this in vitro analysis, most of the glioblastoma cell lines should be sensitive to the TK/GCV system, but there is an urgent need for agents to increase transfection efficiency.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9382960
"""Revisiting the role of p53 in primary and secondary glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) develops from astrocytes and is the most aggressive primary cancer in humans. Invading cells grow rapidly and form their own blood vessels making them difficult to surgically remove or treat. GBM may develop de novo (primary) or through progression from a low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary). Mutational inactivation of the p53 gene and presence of aberrant p53 expression are reported in GBM, suggesting that p53 has a role in tumor progression. This study of seven de novo GBM and four secondary GBM patients, indicated that nine out of eleven (82%) had overexpression of p53. Our histopathological analysis showed that the expression of p53 in three out of four (75%) secondary GBM was confined to the nucleus and the p53 positive cells were randomly distributed throughout the tumor. The expression of p53 in four out of seven (57%) de novo GBM was cytoplasmic, diffusive, and confined to the perivascular region of the tumor. In two (29%) de novo samples both nuclear as well as cytoplasmic staining that was not confined to the perivascular area was observed. The results suggest that cytoplasmic p53 may contribute to the formation and maintenance of de novo GBM by virtue of its control of the vasculature of tumors. Furthermore, cytoplasmic p53 may reflect an association of p53 with Cullin 7, PARC, or with the sequestering partner of p53, mortalin. These results underscore the significance of p53 in the tumorigenesis of de novo GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17214319

Changes associated with treatment in this specific cell population are poorly understood. Therefore, we studied changes in gene expression of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (Iba1+) cells in de novo versus recurrent GBMs. Methods: NanoString GeoMx® Digital Spatial Transcriptomic Profiling of microglia/macrophages (Iba1+) and glial cells (Gfap+) cells identified on tumor sections was performed on paired de novo and recurrent samples obtained from three IDH-wildtype GBM patients. The impact of differentially expressed genes on patient survival was evaluated using publicly available data. Results: Unsupervised analyses of the NanoString GeoMx® Digital Spatial Profiling data revealed clustering based on the transcriptomic data from Iba1+ and Gfap+ cells. As expected, conventional differential gene expression and enrichment analyses revealed upregulation of immune-function-related genes in Iba1+ cells compared to Gfap+ cells. A focused differential gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of phagocytosis and fatty acid/lipid metabolism genes in Iba1+ cells in recurrent GBM samples compared to de novo GBM samples. Importantly, of these genes, the lipid metabolism gene PLD3 consistently correlated with survival in multiple different publicly available datasets.

"""Prognostic significance of the proliferative potential of intracranial gliomas measured by bromodeoxyuridine labeling.""","""The growth potential of 174 intracranial gliomas was estimated by calculating the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (BUdR LI). Each patient received a 30-min infusion of BUdR, 200 mg/m2, before tumor removal. Excised tumor specimens were stained immunohistochemically to determine the BUdR LI, or percentage of S-phase cells. A Cox proportional-hazards stepwise model was used to determine the correlation between the BUdR LI and survival. Among patients with glioblastomas, the BUdR LI did not improve the prediction once age was entered in the model. Among patients with malignant or low-grade astrocytomas, the BUdR LI was the best single predictor of survival. The relative predictive abilities of BUdR LI and histopathology were determined by analyzing malignant astrocytoma and glioblastomas together. Distinguishing between malignant astrocytomas and glioblastomas did not significantly improve the prediction of survival once the BUdR LI and age were entered into the model. Equations derived from the model indicate that the probability of survival is a function of age and BUdR LI in patients with glioblastoma or malignant astrocytoma, but is a function of BUdR LI alone in patients with low-grade astrocytoma. The equations also show a substantial difference in the impact of increased BUdR LI on survival among patients with glioblastoma or malignant astrocytoma and those with low-grade astrocytoma. Without highly effective treatments for specific tumor phenotypes, the survival of a patient with an intracranial glioma appears to depend strongly on the proliferative potential of the tumor. Thus, accurate estimates of the proliferative potential are important in predicting the survival of individual patients with gliomas as well as in evaluating the effectiveness of various types of treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8382191
"""The Role of Fibroblast Activation Protein in Glioblastoma and Gliosarcoma: A Comparison of Tissue, (68)Ga-FAPI-46 PET Data, and Survival Data.""","""Despite their unique histologic features, gliosarcomas belong to the group of glioblastomas and are treated according to the same standards. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a component of a tumor-specific subpopulation of fibroblasts that plays a critical role in tumor growth and invasion. Some case studies suggest an elevated expression of FAP in glioblastoma and a particularly strong expression in gliosarcoma attributed to traits of predominant mesenchymal differentiation. However, the prognostic impact of FAP and its diagnostic and therapeutic potential remain unclear. Here, we investigate the clinical relevance of FAP expression in gliosarcoma and glioblastoma and how it correlates with 68Ga-FAP inhibitor (FAPI)-46 PET uptake. Methods: Patients diagnosed with gliosarcoma or glioblastoma without sarcomatous differentiation with an overall survival of less than 2.5 y were enrolled. Histologic examination included immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative scoring of FAP (0-3, with higher values indicating stronger expression). Additionally, 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET scans were performed in a subset of glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation patients. The clinical SUVs were correlated with FAP expression levels in surgically derived tumor tissue and relevant prognostic factors. Results: Of the 61 patients who were enrolled, 13 of them had gliosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more FAP in gliosarcomas than in glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation of tumor tissue (P < 0.0001). In the latter, FAP expression was confined to the perivascular space, whereas neoplastic cells additionally expressed FAP in gliosarcoma. A significant correlation of immunohistochemical FAP with SUVmean and SUVpeak of 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET indicates that clinical tracer uptake represents FAP expression of the tumor. Although gliosarcomas express higher levels of FAP than do glioblastomas without sarcomatous differentiation, overall survival does not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion: The analysis reveals a significant correlation between SUVmean and SUVpeak in 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET and immunohistochemical FAP expression. This study indicates that FAP expression is much more abundant in the gliosarcoma subgroup of glioblastomas. This could open not only a diagnostic but also a therapeutic gap, since FAP could be explored as a theranostic target to enhance survival in a distinct subgroup of high-risk brain tumor patients with poor survival prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960714
"""Microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1, a novel target in glioblastoma.""","""Genetic heterogeneity is recognized as a major contributing factor of glioblastoma resistance to clinical treatment modalities and consequently low overall survival rates. This genetic diversity results in variations in protein expression, both intratumorally and between individual glioblastoma patients. In this regard, the spectraplakin protein, microtubule actin cross-linking factor 1 (MACF1), was examined in glioblastoma. An expression analysis of MACF1 in various types of brain tumor tissue revealed that MACF1 was predominately present in grade III-IV astroctyomas and grade IV glioblastoma, but not in normal brain tissue, normal human astrocytes and lower grade brain tumors. Subsequent genetic inhibition experiments showed that suppression of MACF1 selectively inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration in cell lines established from patient derived xenograft mouse models and immortalized glioblastoma cell lines that were associated with downregulation of the Wnt-signaling mediators, Axin1 and β-catenin. Additionally, concomitant MACF1 silencing with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) used for the clinical treatment of glioblastomas cooperatively reduced the proliferative capacity of glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, the present study represents the first investigation on the functional role of MACF1 in tumor cell biology, as well as demonstrates its potential as a unique biomarker that can be targeted synergistically with TMZ as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach for the treatment of genetically multifarious glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27959385
"""Histology-based expression profiling yields novel prognostic markers in human glioblastoma.""","""Although the prognosis for patients with glioblastoma is poor, survival is variable, with some patients surviving longer than others. For this reason, there has been longstanding interest in the identification of prognostic markers for glioblastoma. We hypothesized that specific histologic features known to correlate with malignancy most likely express molecules that are directly related to the aggressive behavior of these tumors. We further hypothesized that such molecules could be used as biomarkers to predict behavior in a manner that might add prognostic power to sole histologic observation of the feature. We reasoned that perinecrotic tumor cell palisading, which denotes the most aggressive forms of malignant gliomas, would be a striking histologic feature on which to test this hypothesis. We therefore used laser capture microdissection and oligonucleotide arrays to detect molecules differentially expressed in perinecrotic palisades. A set of RNAs (including POFUT2, PTDSR, PLOD2, ATF5, and HK2) that were differentially expressed in 3 initially studied, microdissected glioblastomas also provided prognostic information in an independent set of 28 glioblastomas that did not all have perinecrotic palisades. On validation in a second, larger independent series, this approach could be applied to other human glioma types to derive tissue biomarkers that could offer ancillary prognostic and predictive information alongside standard histopathologic examination.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16254489

With the aim of finding novel diagnostic and prognostic markers for glioblastoma (GBM), a tissue microarray (TMA) library consisting of 62 GBMs and 28 GBM-associated normal spots was constructed. Immunohistochemistry against 78 GBM-associated proteins was performed. Expression levels of each protein for each patient were analyzed using an image analysis program and converted to H-score [summation of the intensity grade of staining (0-3) multiplied by the percentage of positive cells corresponding to each grade]. Based on H-score and hierarchical clustering methods, we divided the GBMs into two groups (n=19 and 37) that had significantly different survival lengths (p<0.05). In the two groups, expression of nine proteins (survivin, cyclin E, DCC, TGF-β, CDC25B, histone H1, p-EGFR, p-VEGFR2/3, p16) was significantly changed (q<0.05). Prognosis-predicting potential of these proteins were validated with another independent library of 82 GBM TMAs and a public GBM DNA microarray dataset. In addition, we determined 32 aberrant or mislocalized subcellular protein expression patterns in GBMs compared with relatively normal brain tissues, which could be useful for diagnostic biomarkers of GBM.

Recent studies have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability of differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states to radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical and experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict the effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model, we identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of radioresistance. These schedules led to superior survival in mice.

"""Intraventricular Glioblastomas.""","""Background and importance: Although glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor, primary intraventricular locations are extremely rare; only 21 cases have been reported to date. Methods: A retrospectively acquired database of all intracranial glioblastomas treated in 2 different neurosurgical departments during the last 10 years was queried. Patients with histologically proven intraventricular glioblastomas were included in the study. Results: Eight patients were identified as having a histologically confirmed intraventricular glioblastoma. Patient age at diagnosis ranged from 6 to 74 years (mean 29.6 years) and the male/female ratio was 5:3. Increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus was the main cause of the clinical manifestations. The tumor was located within the lateral ventricle in 6 cases and the anterior third ventricle in 2 others. Gross total tumor excision was achieved in 3 patients, whereas the surgical resection was subtotal in 4 cases and a surgical biopsy was performed in 1 patient. Postoperative adjuvant therapies were administered in 5 patients. Median survival time was 32.1 months, and 3 patients were alive at the end of study. All of them had isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated tumors. Conclusions: Intraventricular glioblastoma is extremely rare and can affect younger individuals including children. This malignant tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular lesions, especially in the lateral ventricles. Radical surgical resection can be associated with remarkable disease-free survival, especially in isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated tumors.

Purpose: To investigate if perfusion-weighted MRI is able to differentiate glioblastoma from metastasis and, as a second aim was to see if it was possible in the latter group, to predict the primary site of neoplasm. Material and methods: Hundred and fourteen patients with newly discovered tumor lesion (76 metastases and 38 glioblastomas) underwent conventional contrast-enhanced MRI including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion sequence. The calculated relative cerebral blood volumes were analyzed in the solid tumor area, peritumoral area, area adjacent to peritumoral area, and normal appearing white matter in contralateral semioval center. The Student t-test was used to detect statistically significant differences in relative cerebral blood volume between glioblastomas and metastases in the aforementioned areas. Furthermore, the metastasis group was divided in four sub groups (lung-, breast-, melanoma-, and gastrointestinal origin) and using one-way ANOVA test. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the peritumoral edema was significantly higher in glioblastomas than in metastases (mean 3.2 ± 1.4 and mean 0.9 ± 0.7), respectively, (P < 0.0001). No significant differences in the solid tumor area or the area adjacent to edema were found, (P = 0.28 and 0.21 respectively). There were no significant differences among metastases in the four groups. Conclusion: It is possible to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases by measuring the CBV in the peritumoral edema.

Numerous clinical trials using various target therapeutic agents have failed and recent clinical trials using check point inhibitors also failed to provide survival benefits for glioblastoma patients. Adoptive T cell transfer is suggested as a novel therapeutic approach that has exhibited promise in preliminary clinical studies. However, the clinical outcomes are inconsistent, and there are several limitations of current adoptive T cell transfer strategies for glioblastoma treatment. As an alternative cell therapy, gamma-delta (γδ) T cells have been recently introduced for several cancers including glioblastoma. Since the leading role of γδ T cells is immune surveillance by recognizing a broad range of ligands including stress molecules, phosphoantigens, or lipid antigens, recent studies have suggested the potential benefits of γδ T cell transfer against glioblastomas. However, γδ T cells, as a small subset (1-5%) of T cells in human peripheral blood, are relatively unknown compared to conventional alpha-beta (αβ) T cells. In this context, our study introduced γδ T cells as an alternative and novel option to overcome several challenges regarding immune cell therapy in glioblastoma treatment.

LC/MS analysis demonstrated that U-13C-lactate elicited substantial labeling of TCA-cycle metabolites, acetyl-CoA, and histone protein acetyl-residues in GBM cells. Lactate enhanced chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation in a manner dependent on oxidative energy metabolism and the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Utilizing orthotopic PDX models of GBM, a combined tracer experiment unraveled that lactate carbons were substantially labeling the TCA-cycle metabolites.

Methods: A retrospective review of all patients with thalamic glioblastoma over a 10-yr period was performed. Presenting clinical, radiological, and outcome data were collected. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare clinical characteristics across tumor groups. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to investigate variables of interest with regard to overall survival. Results: Fifty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, with a median age of 53 and median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The most common presenting symptoms were weakness, confusion, and headache. Hydrocephalus was present in 47% of patients preoperatively. Stereotactic biopsy was performed in 47 cases, and 10 patients underwent craniotomy. The median overall survival was 12.2 mo. Higher KPS, younger age, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion were correlated with better overall survival univariately, respectively, while the presence of language deficits at initial presentation was associated with poorer survival.

The aim of this study is to reveal the significance of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion-weighted imaging in differentiating of tumefactive PCNSV (t-PCNSV) lesions from intracranial neoplasms such as glio-blastomas and metastasis. Methods: In this retrospective study, DSC of 8 patients with biopsy-proven t-PCNSV has been compared with DSC obtained in 10 patients with glioblastoma, 10 patients with metastasis, who underwent surgery and histopathological confirmation. The ratio of relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) was calculated by rCBV (lesion) / rCBV (controlateral normal-appearing white matter) in the gadolinium-enhancing solid areas. Results: The mean rrCBV was 0.86±0.7 (range: 0.76-0.98) in the patients with t-PCNSV, 5,16±0.79 in patients with glioblastoma (range: 3.9-6.3), and 4.27±0.73 (range: 2.8-5.3) in patients with metastases. Conclusion: DSC-PWI seems to be useful in the diagnostic work-up of t-PCSNVs.

"""Evo-Devo and the evolution of cancer: a hypothesis for metamorphic therapies for the cancers of prolactin-influenced tumourigenesis: with special reference to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).""","""Recalling the remarkable developmental similarities between cancer cells and embryonic tissues, this paper argues that, by the process of retrodifferentiation and heterochronization, stem cells that have become neoplastic could be said to have undergone 'cellular heterochrony.' It theorizes, therefore, that hormones are the major factor in the non-random regulation of cellular heterochrony in tumourigenesis. Two recent articles confirm that there is low thyroxine and high prolactin in glioblastomas. Thyroxine metamorphoses vertebrates' tissues so as to mature the tissues, e.g., in amphibian metamorphosis. In 1896, thyroxine (horse thyroid extract) was the first successful hormonal product to be used against a fulminating breast cancer. Recent work confirms the important role of prolactin in the induction and progression of mammary, prostate and colorectal tumours. Although the pituitary is the main source of prolactin in vertebrates, there is also placental production of prolactin, and paracrine production of prolactin by tumours themselves. Since tumours produce their own prolactin, shutting down the pituitary source has not proven wholly successful. Research to find prolactin receptor antagonists is ongoing. Therefore, prolactin inhibitors (dopamine agonists), prolactin receptor antagonists, plus thyroxine comprise a plausible metamorphic therapy for shrinking solid tumour mass. By contrast with 'differentiation' therapies currently sought by stem cell oncologists, this paper advocates 'metamorphic' therapies, to introduce hormonal oncological knowledge of how to modulate signalling pathways that are aberrant in the stem cells that give rise to tumours. Despite subtle differences in these signalling translation pathways and cascades, strategies exist that will allow these evolved populations, going back to their stem precursors, to 'metamorphose' or perhaps apoptotically cease proliferation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19250755

Immunohistochemical analysis of 44 surgical specimens revealed that all gliomas were positive for TF, and 19 (95%) of 20 glioblastomas, 12 (86%) of 14 anaplastic astrocytomas and 1 (10%) of 10 benign gliomas were moderately or strongly positive for TF. Our study showed that TF is expressed in gliomas, and that the level of TF expression is correlated with the grade of malignancy of the glioma, suggesting that TF may participate in cell growth.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8958516
"""Genetic and signaling pathway alterations in glioblastoma: relevance to novel targeted therapies.""","""Glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. GBM patients have a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of less than 1 year. During the past decade, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors. Specific genetic defects have been identified that appear to be important for the development, as well as maintenance of the malignant characteristics that are associated with GBM. Some of these genetic aberrations appear to have prognostic significance. However, even more exciting in this era of molecularly targeted therapy are the clues these gene alterations provide for identifying signaling mechanisms responsible for carcinogenesis, and for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Cancer drug therapy is currently undergoing a major transition with an attempt to move from the use of cytotoxic drugs towards the use of tumor mechanism-based drugs. Advances such as the decoding of the human genome, combinatorial chemistry, and gene expression profiling have led to an increase in the rate at which new drugs are being developed. In this review, we will describe the most common genetic and signaling pathway alterations that have relevance to new drug development for the treatment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12700121

"""Influence of the type of surgery on the histologic diagnosis in patients with anaplastic gliomas.""","""Stereotactic biopsy of CNS tumors provides a small amount of tissue for pathologic diagnosis. This potentially leads to inaccurate grading of gliomas because of their histologic heterogeneity. We compared histologic diagnoses in a consecutive series of 329 patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic gliomas whose diagnoses were established by either stereotactic biopsy or open resection. Of 262 patients undergoing resection, 214 (82%) had glioblastomas and 48 (18%) had anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs). Of 67 patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy, 33 (49%) had glioblastomas and 34 (51%) had AAs. This difference suggests that some AAs diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy are actually glioblastomas and has important implications for the design and interpretation of clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1658684

Here, we showed that US28 increased the malignancy of U251 glioblastoma cells by enhancing signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that stimulates oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma. US28 expression increased the abundance of the key components of the S1P signaling axis, including an enzyme that generates S1P [sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)], an S1P receptor [S1P receptor 1 (S1P1)], and S1P itself. Enhanced S1P signaling promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival by activating the kinases AKT and CHK1 and the transcriptional regulators cMYC and STAT3 and by increasing the abundance of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), driving several feed-forward signaling loops. Inhibition of S1P signaling abrogated the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of US28. US28 also activated the S1P signaling axis in HCMV-infected cells. This study uncovers central roles for S1P and CIP2A in feed-forward signaling that contributes to the US28-mediated exacerbation of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37582160

Patients and methods: Clinico-immunohistochemical findings were retrospectively analyzed in 43 supratentorial- and 7 cerebellar GBM. The correlation between survival and immunopositivity for p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Ki-67 in these tumors was statistically analyzed and compared. Results: Of the 43 patients with supratentorial GBM, 27 (62.8%) were EGFR immunopositive; their survival was significantly shorter than that of the 16 EGFR-negative patients (p=0.0248). There was no significant correlation between survival and p53 immunopositivity (p=0.7870) and Ki-67 labeling index (p =0.7133). All 5 cerebellar GBM patients treated with radio- and chemotherapy were EGFR-immunonegative; they survived significantly longer than patients with supratentorial GBM (p=0.0296) possibly because their EGFR negativity rendered their tumors more highly radiosensitive.

"""Incidence, clinicopathologic, and genetic characteristics of mismatch repair gene-mutated glioblastomas.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant gliomas of adults and recur, resulting in death, despite surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. There are a few reports on immunotherapy for the mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient GBMs with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). However, the clinicopathological and genetic features of the MMR genes altered in GBMs have not been elucidated yet. Methods: The authors analyzed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from 282 (276 primary and 6 recurrent) glioblastomas to evaluate the mutational status of six DNA repair-related genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, POLE, and POLD1. Tumors harboring somatic or germline mutations in one or more of these six genes were classified as an MMR gene-altered GBM. The clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of MMR gene-altered GBMs were compared to those of tumors without MMR gene alterations. Results: Sixty germline or somatic mutations were identified in 37 cases (35 primary and two recurrent) of GBM. The most frequently mutated genes were MSH6 and POLE. Single nucleotide variants were the most common, followed by frameshift deletions or insertions and approximately 60% of the mutations were germline mutations. Two patients who showed MSH2 (c.2038C > T) and MSH6 (c.1082G > A) mutations had familial colon cancer. The clinical findings were not different between the two groups. However, the presence of MGMT promoter methylation and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) values (> 20) were correlated with MMR gene alterations. Conclusion: Since MMR-related genes can be found even in primary glioblastoma and are correlated with high TMB and MGMT promoter methylation, MMR genes should be carefully analyzed in NGS study on glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33864561
"""Gamma distribution model of diffusion MRI for evaluating the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status of glioblastomas.""","""Objective: To determine whether the γ distribution (GD) model of diffusion MRI is useful in the evaluation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status of glioblastomas. Methods: 12 patients with IDH-mutant glioblastomas and 54 patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging using 13 b-values from 0 to 1000 s/mm2. The shape parameter (κ) and scale parameter (θ) were obtained with the GD model. Fractions of three different areas under the probability density function curve (f1, f2, f3) were defined as follows: f1, diffusion coefficient (D) < 1.0×10-3 mm2/s; f2, D > 1.0×10-3 and <3.0×10-3 mm2/s; f3, D > 3.0 × 10-3 mm2/s. The GD model-derived parameters measured in gadolinium-enhancing lesions were compared between the IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype groups. Receiver operating curve analyses were performed to assess the parameters' diagnostic performances. Results: The IDH-mutant group's f1 (0.474 ± 0.143) was significantly larger than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.347 ± 0.122, p = 0.0024). The IDH-mutant group's f2 (0.417 ± 0.131) was significantly smaller than the IDH-wildtype group's (0.504 ± 0.126, p = 0.036).

We studied 5 benign gliomas (including 1 case of radiation necrosis), 8 malignant astrocytomas, and 8 glioblastomas. The Td's of enhanced areas on CT scans of benign gliomas, malignant astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were 937 +/- 66.5 days, 65.1 +/- 29.4 days, and 48.1 +/- 20.9 days, respectively. The Td's of low density areas were 895 +/- 130.6 days, 70.8 +/- 22.2 days, and 50.5 +/- 14.7 days. There was a significant correlation between the Td's of the enhanced and low density areas (0.97). The enhancement effect increased at recurrence in 55% of the cases, with an average increase of 1.1 grades. The increase in enhancement effect at recurrence showed a tendency to become smaller as the tumor's degree of anaplasia increased. Radiotherapy was effective in significantly retarding the growth rate of malignant gliomas, whose Td's were doubled. Although the Td's of both enhanced and low density areas of benign gliomas were significantly longer than those of malignant gliomas, there was no significant difference in the Td's of enhanced areas between malignant astrocytomas and glioblastomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3027609
"""Borax regulates iron chaperone- and autophagy-mediated ferroptosis pathway in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is classified as a stage-IV glioma. Unfortunately, there are currently no curative treatments for GBM. Poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is a cytosolic iron chaperone with diverse functions. PCBP1 is also known to regulate autophagy, but the role of PCBP1 in ferroptosis, iron-dependent cell death pathway, remains unrevealed in GBM cells. Here, we investigated the effects of borax, a boron compound, on the ferroptosis signaling pathway mediated by PCBP1 and autophagy. The study analyzed cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle on U87-MG and HMC3 cells to investigate the effects of borax. After determining the cytotoxic concentrations of borax, morphological analyzes and measurement of PCBP1, Beclin1, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) levels were performed. Finally, expression levels of PCBP1, Beclin1, GPx4 and ACSL4, and caspase-3/7 activity were determined. We found that borax reduced U87-MG cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, borax altered cell proliferation and remarkably reduced S phase in the U87-MG cells and exhibited selectivity by having an opposite effect on normal cells (HMC3). According to DAPI staining, borax caused nuclear deficits in U87-MG cells. The result showed that borax in U87-MG cells induced reduction of the PCBP1, GSH, and GPx4 and enhancement of Beclin1, MDA, and ACSL4.

However, identification of the GBM subtype is complicated by the intratumoral heterogeneity that results in coexistence of multiple subtypes within the tissue specimen. Here, we present the use of hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for rapid, label-free molecular assessment of GBM intratumoral heterogeneity with submicron resolution. We develop a unique label-free Raman imaging diagnostic platform consisting of the spectral focusing hyperspectral SRS imaging of the large-area GBM tissue specimens, SRS images, and spectrum retrieval using the multivariate curve resolution algorithm and subtype classification based on the quadratic support vector machine model for rapid molecular subtyping of GBMs. Both the stain-free SRS histological images and 2D subtype maps can be obtained within 20-30 min which is superior to the days of the conventional single-cell RNA sequencing. While the SRS histology assesses the demyelination status as a new diagnostic feature, the SRS mapping provides a new insight into intratumoral heterogeneity across GBM tissue specimens. We find that the major proportions of the GBM tissues agree with the diagnostic results of the genomic analysis, but nontrivial portions of the remaining SRS image tiles in the specimens are found to belong to other molecular subtypes, implying the substantial degree of GBM heterogeneity. The rapid SRS imaging diagnostic platform developed has shown the ability of unveiling tumor heterogeneity in GBM tissues accurately, which would promote the improvement of the GBM-targeted therapy in near future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33443405

This membrane protein is localized on the vascular endothelium of nearly every human tissue and plays a crucial role in the maintenance of antithrombotic property of the endothelial cells. Although the normal cerebral vessels were negative for TM, the tumor vessels were positive for TM. The increased expression of TM was, however, demonstrated not only in glioblastomas but also in low-grade astrocytomas. Furthermore, the vessels in the brains adjacent to tumor and gliotic brains were also positive for TM. Those observations suggested that the tendency of intratumoral bleeding, which is rather characteristic of glioblastomas, is not simply explained by the altered expression of vascular endothelial TM. In two cases of glioblastoma, not only the blood vessels but also the tumor cells were positive.

Presence of IDH-mutations was determined by IDH1 R132H immunohistochemical analysis and DNA sequencing of surgically obtained tissues. Six out of 44 (13.6%) glioblastomas were IDH-mutant. IDH-mutant glioblastoma exhibited significantly higher accumulation of 2HG (median 3.191 vs. 0.000 mM, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). A cutoff of 2HG = 0.897 mM achieved high sensitivity (100.0%) and specificity (92.59%) in determining IDH-mutation in glioblastoma. Glioblastoma with high 2HG accumulation did not have significantly longer overall survival than glioblastoma with low 2HG accumulation (p = 0.107, log-rank test). Non-invasive and reliable detection of 2HG in IDH-mutant glioblastoma was possible by 3.0-T SVMRS.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28956184
"""Patterns of intracranial glioblastoma recurrence after aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant management: retrospective analysis of 43 cases.""","""The present retrospective study evaluated the recurrence patterns after aggressive surgical removal of intracranial glioblastomas in 43 consecutive adult patients. The resection rate of the enhanced lesion on magnetic resonance imaging was 100% and 95-99% in 22 and 21 cases, respectively. All patients received postoperative fractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with additional chemotherapy (25 cases) or vaccine therapy (18 cases). During follow-up (median 17 months), tumor recurrence was identified in 33 patients, most frequently regional within the wall of the resection cavity (20 cases). No clinical factor differed significantly between the groups of patients with regional or marginal tumor progression (N = 22) and patients with distant or multiple recurrences (N = 8). Progression-free survival did not differ significantly between these two groups (p = 0.27). However, overall survival was significantly longer (p = 0.04) in patients with regional or marginal tumor progression, and constituted 90% and 54% at 1 and 2 years after surgery, respectively, compared to 75% and 0% in patients with distant or multiple recurrences. Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant management of intracranial glioblastoma may change its recurrence pattern. Tumor progression appears in the wall of the resection cavity or within 2 cm from its margin in approximately half of patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22976141
"""Investigation of U-251 cell death triggered by flavonoid luteolin: towards a better understanding on its anticancer property against glioblastomas.""","""Recently, many studies have reported the anticancer properties of flavonoid luteolin against a variety of tumors, but there is still a lack in the description of its mechanism of action. In attempt to better contribute to the literature, we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of luteolin extracted by Fridericia platyphylla in a panel of tumor cell lines representative of six different tissues. Luteolin presented antiproliferative activity for all the assessed tumor cell lines, being glioblastoma the most sensitive one. This compound was able to inhibit U-251 cells migration and tumorigenesis. Besides, luteolin leads U-251 tumor cells to apoptosis death by depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, ERK proteins phosphorylation, cleavage of PARP and Caspase 9, further inducing DNA damage by H2AX phosphorylation, which had not yet been described for glioblastomas. Altogether, our results reaffirm luteolin as a potential therapeutic drug.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32081041
"""Subventricular zone-associated classification in isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype glioblastomas: improved prognostic value through integration of FLAIR with contrast-enhanced imaging.""","""Objective: Controversy surrounds the prognostic value of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1CE) imaging-based subventricular zone (SVZ) classification in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastomas (GBMs). In this study, the authors aimed to assess the potential of incorporating FLAIR imaging into T1CE imaging-based classification for improving prognostic accuracy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 281 patients with IDH-wildtype GBM. T1CE imaging-based classification was performed, and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging was integrated to evaluate its prognostic estimation ability. Based on the relationship between the tumors and SVZ, patients were categorized into SVZ+ and SVZ- cohorts based on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging findings. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Patients were then categorized into three subgroups based on their combined classifications: group 1 (SVZ+ on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging), group 2 (SVZ- on T1CE but SVZ+ on T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging), and group 3 (SVZ- on T1CE and T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging). Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate differences in clinical and molecular factors as well as in prognoses. Results: The T1CE imaging-based classification failed to stratify OS between SVZ+ and SVZ- cohorts (16.0 vs 20.0 months, p = 0.36). Survival analysis revealed similar prognoses for patients in groups 1 and 2, and patients in group 2 exhibited worse OS compared with those in group 3 (19.0 vs 23.5 months, p = 0.024). Logistic regression identified lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (p = 0.011), tumor diameter (p = 0.002), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation (p = 0.003) to be associated with a higher incidence of group 2 GBMs. Additionally, T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging-based classification provided significant prognostic value (17.0 vs 23.5 months p = 0.021) and was found to be an independent prognostic factor in the Cox multivariate analysis (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.08-2.96; p = 0.024). Conclusions: This study underscores the limitations of T1CE imaging-based SVZ-associated classification in predicting prognosis for IDH-wildtype GBMs. The authors therefore propose an integrated approach that involves T2-weighted/FLAIR imaging that can provide improved prognostic ability. Notably, the presence of TERT promoter mutation was identified as a critical factor in nonenhancing tumor infiltration into the SVZ. Further validation through extensive cohort studies is recommended to confirm these findings.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38941641

Methods: We used surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) technology with surface chromatographic subproteome enrichment and preservation of the spatial distribution of proteomic patterns to detect discrete modifications of protein expression. We performed in situ proteomic profiling of mouse tissue and samples of human cancer tissue, including brain and lung cancer.

We aimed to determine if conventional MRI features of recurrent GB predict survival of patients receiving bevacizumab. Methods: Patients with recurrent GB were retrospectively included if they received bevacizumab monotherapy between 2008 and 2017 after failure of standard treatment. Their MRI studies obtained at baseline and tumor recurrence, prior to bevacizumab treatment, were evaluated for multiple MRI features including measurable tumor, baseline multicentric tumors, distant recurrence, non-contrast-enhancing tumor, deep white matter invasion, multiple parenchymal tumors, bilateral cerebral involvement, ependymal extension and leptomeningeal dissemination. Predictive values of MRI features and patient characteristics on patient survival were statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 103 patients were included. Baseline multicentric tumors (OR = 4.07; P = 0.042) and distant recurrence (OR = 28.5; P < 0.001) were two significant predictors of 3-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Distant recurrence (HR = 3.94; P < 0.001) was the only independent predictor of PFS. Baseline multicentric tumors (HR = 1.97; P = 0.028), distant recurrence (HR = 4.73; P < 0.001) and leptomeningeal dissemination (HR = 2.28; P = 0.044) were three independent predictors of overall survival.

"""Myoinositol to Total Choline Ratio in Glioblastomas as a Potential Prognostic Factor in Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.""","""Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type diffuse astrocytic tumors tend to be pathologically diagnosed as glioblastomas (GBMs). We previously reported that myoinositol to total choline (Ins/Cho) ratio in GBMs on magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was significantly lower than that in IDH-mutant gliomas. We then hypothesized that a low Ins/Cho ratio is a poor prognosis factor in patients with GBMs, IDH-wild-type. In the present study, we calculated the Ins/Cho ratios of patients with GBMs and investigated their progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to determine their utility as prognostic marker. We classified patients with GBMs harboring wild-type IDH (n = 27) into two groups based on the Ins/Cho ratio, and compared patient backgrounds, pathological findings, PFS, OS, and copy number aberrations between the high and low Ins/Cho groups. Patients with GBMs in the low Ins/Cho ratio group indicated shorter PFS (P = 0.021) and OS (P = 0.048) than those in the high Ins/Cho group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the Ins/Cho ratio was significantly correlated with PFS (hazard ratio 0.24, P = 0.028). In conclusion, the preoperative Ins/Cho ratio can be used as a novel potential prognostic factor for GBM, IDH-wild-type.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34078827
"""Physiological Imaging Methods for Evaluating Response to Immunotherapies in Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, with a dismal prognosis despite aggressive multi-modal therapy. Immunotherapy is currently being evaluated as an alternate treatment modality for recurrent GBMs in clinical trials. These immunotherapeutic approaches harness the patient's immune response to fight and eliminate tumor cells. Standard MR imaging is not adequate for response assessment to immunotherapy in GBM patients even after using refined response assessment criteria secondary to amplified immune response. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective and alternative neuroimaging techniques for accurate response assessment. To this end, some groups have reported the potential of diffusion and perfusion MR imaging and amino acid-based positron emission tomography techniques in evaluating treatment response to different immunotherapeutic regimens in GBMs. The main goal of these techniques is to provide definitive metrics of treatment response at earlier time points for making informed decisions on future therapeutic interventions.

In this retrospective study, whether patients with newly diagnosed GBM experience significant lymphopenia after concomitant chemoradiation (CCRT) was evaluated, and whether TLC after this treatment is associated with OS in the treated population was examined. Using electronic medical records, all patients newly diagnosed with GBM between 2008 and 2016 at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital were retrospectively examined. The eligible criteria included the following: 1) craniotomy with surgical resection or biopsy, 2) completion of CCRT, 3) accessible baseline and/or follow-up complete blood count (CBC). Median TLC significantly decreased after completion of CCRT, compared to TLC at baseline (1742 versus 1319 cells/mm3, P-value < 0.001).

Four cell lines were characterized by the expression of neurodevelopmental genes. They showed a multipotent differentiation profile along neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages, grew spherically in vitro, expressed CD133 and formed highly invasive tumors in vivo. The other five cell lines shared expression signatures enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes, had a more restricted differentiation capacity, contained no or fewer CD133+ cells, grew semiadherent or adherent in vitro and displayed reduced tumorigenicity and invasion in vivo. Our findings show that stable, multipotent glioblastoma cell lines with a full stem-like phenotype express neurodevelopmental genes as a distinctive feature, which may offer therapeutic targeting opportunities. The generation of another distinct cluster of cell lines showing similarly homogeneous profiling but restricted stem cell properties suggests that different phenotypes exist, each of which may lead to the typical appearance of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18037961

The purpose of this study was to characterize glioblastoma lesions by identifying MR imaging voxel-based tumor location features that are associated with tumor molecular profiles, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: Preoperative T1 anatomic MR images of 384 patients with glioblastomas were obtained from 2 independent cohorts (n = 253 from the Stanford University Medical Center for training and n = 131 from The Cancer Genome Atlas for validation). An automated computational image-analysis pipeline was developed to determine the anatomic locations of tumor in each patient. Voxel-based differences in tumor location between good (overall survival of >17 months) and poor (overall survival of <11 months) survival groups identified in the training cohort were used to classify patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort into 2 brain-location groups, for which clinical features, messenger RNA expression, and copy number changes were compared to elucidate the biologic basis of tumors located in different brain regions. Results: Tumors in the right occipitotemporal periventricular white matter were significantly associated with poor survival in both training and test cohorts (both, log-rank P < .05) and had larger tumor volume compared with tumors in other locations. Tumors in the right periatrial location were associated with hypoxia pathway enrichment and PDGFRA amplification, making them potential targets for subgroup-specific therapies.

However, little was known about the correlation between CPEB4 and glioblastoma cell proliferation and the prognostic significance in patients. Our aim was to investigate the functional role and prognostic value of CPEB4 in glioblastoma. Patients and methods: We determined the expression of CPEB4 protein using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing 278 glioma patients (including 98 primary glioblastomas) and evaluated its association with pathological grades and clinical outcome by univariate and multivariate analyses. And then, lentiviral-mediated RNAi targeting CPEB4 was utilized to study the role of CPEB4 in glioblastoma cell proliferation. Results: In our cohort, CPEB4 expression was positively related to glioma pathological grade (p < 0.01) and elevated in glioblastoma (p < 0.01). High expression of CPEB4 was associated with significantly poor prognosis, and could be identified as an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of glioblastoma patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.730, p = 0.014 and HR = 1.877, p = 0.004, respectively). In vitro studies further showed that downregulation of CPEB4 significantly reduced the growth rate of T98G and U251 cells comparing with the controls.

Although certain genomic alterations have been identified as prognostic biomarkers of GBMs, the histomorphological features that predict their prognosis remain elusive. In this study, following an integrative diagnosis of 227 GBMs based on the 2021 World Health Organization classification system, the cases were histologically fractionated by cellular variations and abundance to evaluate the relationship between cellular heterogeneity and prognosis in combination with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene promoter methylation (mMGMTp) status. GBMs comprised four major cell types: astrocytic, pleomorphic, gemistocytic, and rhabdoid cells. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis using the histological abundance of heterogeneous cell types identified two distinct groups with significantly different prognoses. In individual cell component analysis, the abundance of gemistocytes showed a significantly favorable prognosis but confounding to mMGMTp status. Conversely, the abundance of epithelioid cells was correlated with the unfavorable prognosis. Linear model analysis showed the favorable prognostic utility of quantifying gemistocytic and epithelioid cells, independent of mMGMTp. The evaluation of GBM cell histomorphological heterogeneity is more effective for prognosis prediction in combination with mMGMTp analysis, indicating that histomorphological analysis is a practical and useful prognostication tool in an integrative diagnosis of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39438642

Objective: To evaluate the results of radiosurgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and to identify the factors determining its effectiveness. Material and methods: Radiosurgery has been carried out in 168 patients with relapses of glioblastoma between 2005 and 2021. This study enrolled 88 patients with 180 foci of local and distant progression. Mean age of patients was 42.8±2.1 years (range 4-73). Mean period between diagnosis and repeated irradiation was 12.7 months. Mean volume of focus was 2.4 cm3, mean dose - 20 Gy. Median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 11.2 months. Results: Repeated irradiation with correction of systemic therapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival with insignificant radiation-induced toxicity. Annual overall survival was 62.2%, median of overall survival after radiosurgery - 15.1 months. Significant factors of local control were marginal dose of at least 18 Gy and distant relapse. Median of progression-free survival in the group of distant progression of glioblastoma was only 3.6 months vs. 9.1 months in patients with local recurrence.

We report here experimental evidences that DUSP6 is transcriptionally upregulated in primary and long-term cultures of human glioblastoma, as assayed by northern hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, producing constitutive high level of protein expression. Functional assays were performed with adenovirus-mediated expression of DUSP6 in glioblastoma cultures. Protein overexpression inhibits growth by inducing G1-phase delay and increased mitogenic/anchorage dependence and clonogenic potential in vitro. Changes in cell morphology were associated with an increased tumor growth in vivo. Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure and poor outcome in human glioblastomas. Importantly, DUSP6 overexpression increased resistance to cisplatin-mediated cell death in vitro and in vivo.

We tested whether the small-molecule and orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) can reverse this cancer-specific metabolic and mitochondrial remodeling in glioblastoma. Freshly isolated glioblastomas from 49 patients showed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, which was rapidly reversed by DCA. In a separate experiment with five patients who had glioblastoma, we prospectively secured baseline and serial tumor tissue, developed patient-specific cell lines of glioblastoma and putative glioblastoma stem cells (CD133(+), nestin(+) cells), and treated each patient with oral DCA for up to 15 months. DCA depolarized mitochondria, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and induced apoptosis in GBM cells, as well as in putative GBM stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. DCA therapy also inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, promoted p53 activation, and suppressed angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The dose-limiting toxicity was a dose-dependent, reversible peripheral neuropathy, and there was no hematologic, hepatic, renal, or cardiac toxicity. Indications of clinical efficacy were present at a dose that did not cause peripheral neuropathy and at serum concentrations of DCA sufficient to inhibit the target enzyme of DCA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase II, which was highly expressed in all glioblastomas.

"""Recent advances in subtyping tumors of the central nervous system using molecular data.""","""Primary brain tumors account for substantial morbidity and mortality. They often infiltrate the brain diffusely, continue growing, and cause adverse events, such as headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits. The classification of primary brain tumors, based for decades on histology, has been fundamentally changed by the World Health Organization in 2016 by incorporation of molecular data. Areas covered: Literature from glioblastomas, high- and low-grade astrocytic, oligodendroglial, glioneuronal and ependymal tumors from the last five years were reviewed. Results from comprehensive molecular profiling of neoplasms and impact of recent molecular subtyping on neuropathological diagnosis are presented. Expert commentary: The identification of frequent acquired mutations shows that adult and pediatric glioblastomas have divergent biology with differing prognoses. Astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma are more closely related than previously thought. Molecular profiling now enables the precise classification of most diffuse gliomas into three clinically and therapeutically different subtypes according to the presence or absence of IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion. New subgroups with different clinical outcomes and anatomic locations have emerged in ependymomas and pediatric embryonal tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27893285
"""IDH1-associated primary glioblastoma in young adults displays differential patterns of tumour and vascular morphology.""","""Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive tumour with marked heterogeneity at the morphological level in both the tumour cells and the associated highly prominent vasculature. As we begin to develop an increased biological insight into the underlying processes driving the disease, fewer attempts have thus far been made to understand these phenotypic differences. We sought to address this by carefully assessing the morphological characteristics of both the tumour cells and the associated vasculature, relating these observations to the IDH1/MGMT status, with a particular focus on the early onset population of young adults who develop primary glioblastoma. 276 primary glioblastoma specimens were classified into their predominant cell morphological type (fibrillary, gemistocytic, giant cell, small cell, oligodendroglial, sarcomatous), and assessed for specific tumour (cellularity, necrosis, palisades) and vascular features (glomeruloid structures, arcades, pericyte proliferation). IDH1 positive glioblastomas were associated with a younger age at diagnosis, better clinical outcome, prominent oligodendroglial and small cell tumour cell morphology, pallisading necrosis and glomeruloid vascular proliferation in the absence of arcade-like structures. These features widen the phenotype of IDH1 mutation-positive primary glioblastoma in young adults and provide correlative evidence for a functional role of mutant IDH1 in the differential nature of neo-angiogenesis in different subtypes of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23451042
"""Differentiation between glioblastomas, solitary brain metastases, and primary cerebral lymphomas using diffusion tensor and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging.""","""Background and purpose: Glioblastomas, brain metastases, and PCLs may have similar enhancement patterns on MR imaging, making the differential diagnosis difficult or even impossible. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a combination of DTI and DSC can assist in the differentiation of glioblastomas, solitary brain metastases, and PCLs. Materials and methods: Twenty-six glioblastomas, 25 brain metastases, and 16 PCLs were retrospectively identified. DTI metrics, including FA, ADC, CL, CP, CS, and rCBV were measured from the enhancing, immediate peritumoral and distant peritumoral regions. A 2-level decision tree was designed, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used at each level to determine the best model for classification. Results: From the enhancing region, significantly elevated FA, CL, and CP and decreased CS values were observed in glioblastomas compared with brain metastases and PCLs (P < .001), whereas ADC, rCBV, and rCBV(max) values of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of PCLs (P < .01). The best model to distinguish glioblastomas from nonglioblastomas consisted of ADC, CS (or FA) from the enhancing region, and rCBV from the immediate peritumoral region, resulting in AUC = 0.938. The best predictor to differentiate PCLs from brain metastases comprised ADC from the enhancing region and CP from the immediate peritumoral region with AUC = 0.909. Conclusions: The combination of DTI metrics and rCBV measurement can help in the differentiation of glioblastomas from brain metastases and PCLs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21330399
"""Is there pseudoprogression in secondary glioblastomas?""","""Purpose: Pseudoprogression (PP) during adjuvant treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is frequent and is a clinically and radiologically challenging problem. While there are several reports of the frequency of PP in GBM cohorts including mainly patients with primary GBM, there are few data on the incidence of PP in patients with secondary glioblastomas (sGBM). Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PP in sGBM. Methods and materials: We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of PP in adult patients with sGBM treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRTx) using temozolomide (TMZ) and sought to assess if there was an association between PP and MGMT promoter methylation status, IDH mutations status, or 1p/19q codeletion. The definition of PP according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group was used. Results: None of the evaluable 15 sGBM patients in our series demonstrated a PP. Of the 9 sGBM patients who received concomitant CRTx with TMZ, 6 patients had the methylated MGMT promoter, and 6 patients had IDH mutations. There also was no PP identified in sGBM patients who received sequential CRTx, irrespective of MGMT or IDH status. The median time of follow-up was 3.4 years after diagnosis of an sGBM, and the median overall survival was 18.2 months (range, 14.3-45.2 months). Three of 15 patients had previously received radiation therapy for their World Health Organization low-grade 2 glioma, while none of them had received chemotherapy at that stage. Conclusions: Based on this small series of sGBM patients treated with CRTx (concomitantly or sequentially) the frequency of PP appears to be very low in sGBM, even in those patients with methylated MGMT promoter or IDH mutations. Our results highlight the differences between primary glioblastomas and sGBM in particular as they relate to PP.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267971

Few studies have examined prognostic factors in patients with recurrent glioblastomas. At relapse, the pathological features of glioblastomas are affected by tumor regrowth and the influence of chemoradiotherapy during the initial treatment. Morphological transformations at recurrence include quantitative changes in tumor cells, such as the presence of giant cells and gemistocytic cell formation, radiation necrosis, and vascular structural changes. Therefore, we should carefully examine pathological findings at recurrence. In this report, we analyzed MGMT promoter status, the MIB-1 index, and the pathology of tumor samples at the first (primary tumor) and second (recurrent tumor) surgeries and clarified prognostic factors in patients with recurrent cases.

There is, however, a third subset of malignant gliomas in which genetic lesions remain to be identified. Following surgical resection, all gliomas appear to have an inherent tendency to recur. Comparative molecular analysis of ten primary malignant gliomas (three anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas multiforme) with their recurrences identified two distinct subgroups of recurrent tumors. In one group, primary tumors harbored genetic aberrations frequently associated with linear progression or de novo formation pathways of glial tumorigenesis and maintained their genetic profiles upon recurrence. In the other subset with no detectable known genetic mutations at first presentation, the recurrent tumors sustained specific abnormalities associated with pathways of linear progression or de novo formation. These included loss of genes on chromosomes 17 and 10, mutations in the p53 gene, homozygous deletion of the DMBTA1 and p16 and/ or p15 genes and amplification and/or overexpression of CDK4 and alpha form of the PDGF receptor. Recurrent tumors from both groups also displayed an abnormal expression profile of the metalloproteinase, gel A, and its inhibitor, TIMP-2, consistent with their highly invasive behavior.

Aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy provides limited overall survival benefit. Glioblastomas have a formidable tumor microenvironment that is hostile to immunological effector cells and these cancers produce profound systemic immunosuppression. However, surgical resection of these tumors creates conditions that favor the use of immunotherapeutic strategies. Therefore, extensive surgical resection, when feasible, will remain part of the equation to provide an environment in which active specific immunotherapy has the greatest chance of working. Toward that end, a number of vaccination protocols are under investigation. Vaccines studied to date have produced cellular and humoral antitumor responses, but unequivocal clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated. In addition, focus is shifting toward the prospect of therapies involving vaccines in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents so that effector cells remain active against their targets systemically and within the tumor microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993092

A T cell-mediated immune response could deal with these challenges based on the ability of polyclonal T cell populations to recognize diverse tumor antigens and perform surveillance throughout tissues. Here we will discuss the major pathways that inhibit T cell-mediated immunity against glioblastoma, with an emphasis on receptor-ligand systems by which glioma cells and recruited myeloid cells inhibit T cell function. A related challenge is that glioblastomas tend to be poorly infiltrated by T cells, which is not only caused by inhibitory molecular pathways but also currently utilized drugs, in particular high-dose corticosteroids that kill activated, proliferating T cells. We will discuss innovative approaches to induce glioblastoma-directed T cell responses, including neoantigen-based vaccines and sophisticated CAR T cell approaches that can target heterogeneous glioblastoma cell populations.

These subtypes of glioblastoma constitute distinct disease entities that evolve through different genetic pathways, affect patients at different ages, and are likely to differ in prognosis and response to therapy. Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show EGFR overexpression, PTEN (MMAC1) mutations, CDKN2A (p16) deletions, and less frequently, MDM2 amplification. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and often contain TP53 mutations as the earliest detectable alteration. These characteristics are derived largely from patients selected on the basis of clinical history and sequential biopsies. Currently available data are insufficient for a substitution of histologic classification and grading of astrocytic tumors by genetic typing alone. More subtypes of glioblastomas may exist with intermediate clinical and genetic profiles, a factor exemplified by the giant-cell glioblastoma that clinically and genetically occupies a hybrid position between primary (de novo) and secondary glioblastomas.

"""Hurdles in radiation planning for glioblastoma: Can delayed-contrast enhanced computed tomography be a potential solution?""","""Objective: Conformal radiation is the standard of care in treatment of glioblastoma. Although co-registration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with early contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is recommended for target delineation by consensus guidelines, ground realities in developing countries often result in availability of less-than-ideal MR sequences for treatment planning. Purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of incorporation of delayed-CECT sequences for radiation planning in glioblastomas, as an adjunct or alternative to MRI. Methods: Case records of all patients of glioblastoma treated at our center between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Gross treatment volumes were delineated on T1 contrast MRI (m-GTV), early CECT (e-GTV) and delayed CECT (d-GTV); volumetric comparisons were made using repeated measures analysis of variance and pair-wise analysis. Results: Although 96% of registered patients underwent postoperative MRI, only 38% of them had desirable sequences suitable for co-registration. Median duration between acquisition of postoperative MRI and surgery was 45 days (range, 33-60), whereas that between MRI and treatment-planning CT was 5 days (range, 1-10). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001) were obtained between mean volumes of e-GTV (41.20cc), d-GTV (58.09cc) and m-GTV (60.52cc). Although the mean GTV increased by 46% between early CECT and MRI, the difference was only 4% between delayed CECT and MRI. Conclusion: Delayed CECT is superior to early CECT for co-registration with MRI for target delineation, especially when available MR sequences are less-than-ideal for treatment planning, and can be considered as the most appropriate adjunct as well as an alternative to MRI, compared to early CECT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30698349
"""Intra-operative characterization of gliomas by near-infrared spectroscopy: possible association with prognosis.""","""Background: Growth and expansion of gliomas are highly dependent on vascular neogenesis. An association of microvascular density and tumour energy metabolism is assumed in most human gliomas. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize a series of gliomas by intra-operative near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and to elucidate the relationship between microvascular blood volume (BV), oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), histology and patient survival. Method: The study included 13 patients with gliomas, in whom complete tumour resection according to postoperative magnetic resonance imaging criteria was achieved. Intra-operatively, one low grade astrocytoma, five anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas with the ipsilateral cortex were investigated by NIRS revealing capillary BV (total haemoglobin) and SaO(2). Intratumoural BV (tBV) and SaO(2) (tSaO(2)) were additionally used in relation to histology and survival. Findings: The mean tBV of the astrocytomas was 4.96 mg/ml compared to 18.40 mg/ml in the glioblastoma group. Mean tSaO(2) was 36% in the astrocytoma group and 52% in the glioblastomas, respectively. Both tBV and tSaO(2) were significantly higher (p<0.01) in the glioblastoma group. Median survival time was shortest for patients with glioblastoma (12.5 months), with tBV >10/mg/ml (10 months), and tSaO(2) >50% (10 months). Longest median survival times were observed in the astrocytoma group (32.5 months), in patients with Tbv <10/mg/ml (30 months), and tSaO(2) <50% (27.5 months). The differences were highly significant (p<0.01). Interpretation: Intra-operative characterization of gliomas by NIRS is feasible. High tBV represents extensive angiogenetic activity of the tumour, whereas high tSaO(2) may be result of non-oxidative glucose metabolism with less oxygen extraction from the capillary bed of the tumour. However, the extent of tBV and tSaO(2) are both of possible prognostic value thus resulting in additional information about the tumour.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12836069

Among the subtypes, PN and MES GBMs show mutually exclusive genetic signatures, and the MES phenotype is, in general, believed to be associated with more aggressive features of GBM: tumor recurrence and drug resistance. Therefore, targeting MES GBMs would improve the overall prognosis of patients with fatal tumors. In this study, we propose peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker as well as therapeutic target for MES GBM; we used multiple approaches to assess PPARγ, including biostatistics analysis and assessment of preclinical studies. First, we found that PPARγ was exclusively expressed in MES glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), and ligand activation of endogenous PPARγ suppressed cell growth and stemness in MES GSCs. Further in vivo studies involving orthotopic and heterotopic xenograft mouse models confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of targeting PPARγ; compared to control mice, those that received ligand treatment exhibited longer survival as well as decreased tumor burden. Mechanistically, PPARγ activation suppressed proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway. Biostatistical analysis using The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA, n = 206) and REMBRANDT (n = 329) revealed that PPARγ upregulation is linked to poor overall survival and disease-free survival of GBM patients. Analysis was performed on prospective (n = 2) and retrospective (n = 6) GBM patient tissues, and we finally confirmed that PPARγ expression was distinctly upregulated in MES GBM.

We focused on the relationship of NSCs with glioblastoma, since we have discovered that recurrent glioblastomas were inclined to be derived from subventricular zone (SVZ), where NSCs reside. We want to clarify whether NSCs are involved in glioblastoma relapse. Methods: Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the stemness of NSCs. The Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to measure the proliferation of cells. Migration abilities were examined by wound healing and transwell assays, and tumor formation abilities were confirmed in nude mice. Results: We found in experiments that NSCs promoted proliferation of a glioblastoma cell line-Ln229, the migration ability of Ln229 cells was motivated by co-cultured with NSCs. Tumor formation of Ln229 cells was also accelerated in nude mice when co-transplanted with NSCs. In immunohistochemistry, we found that the Sox2- and Ki67-positive cells were much higher in co-transplanted groups than that of control groups. Conclusions: These results imply the potential role that NSCs play in speeding up tumor formation in the process of glioblastoma relapse, providing the basis for dealing with newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients, which may help postpone the recurrence of glioblastoma as far as possible through preprocessing the tumor-adjacent SVZ tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945128

It has been reported that progesterone (P4) regulates the progression of GBMs by modifying the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion; however, it is not fully understood how these processes are regulated. It is possible that P4 mediates some of these effects through changes in the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in GBM cells. The present study investigated the effects of P4 on miRNAs expression profile in U‑251MG cells derived from a human GBM. U‑251MG cells were treated for 6 h with P4, RU486 (an antagonist of the intracellular progesterone receptor), the combined treatment (P4+RU486) and cyclodextrin (vehicle) and then a miRNA microarray analysis conducted. The expression analysis revealed a set of 190 miRNAs with differential expression in the treatments of P4, RU486 and P4+RU486 in respect to the vehicle and P4 in respect to P4+RU486, of which only 16 were exclusively regulated by P4.

Encapsulation using microporous membranes can protect the packaging cells from rejection. In this study, we used an encapsulated murine packaging cell line to test the effects of in situ delivery of a retrovirus bearing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene in a rat model of orthotopic glioblastoma. Materials and methods: To test gene transfer in vitro, encapsulated murine psi2-VIK packaging cells were co-cultured with baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and the percentage of transfected BHK cells was determined. For in vivo experiments, orthotopic C6 glioblastomas were established in Wistar rats. Capsules containing psi2-VIK cells were stereotaxically implanted into these tumours and the animals were treated with ganciclovir (GCV). Tumours were harvested 14 days after initiation of GCV therapy for morphometric analysis. Results: Encapsulation of psi2-VIK cells increased transfection rates of BHK target cells significantly in vitro compared to psi2-VIK conditioned medium (3 x 10(6) vs 2.3 x 10(4) cells; P<0.001). In vivo treatment with encapsulated packaging cells resulted in 3% to 5% of C6 tumour cells transduced and 45% of tumour volume replaced by necrosis after GCV (P<0.01 compared to controls).

However, additional alterations in gliomas that coexist with BRAF-mutations are poorly defined. Methods: We analyzed next-generation sequencing results in 315 cancer-associated genes for 372 gliomas from our institution (2010 to 2017). In addition, we reviewed IDH-WT gliomas with mutation and copy-number alterations available in cBioPortal, to further characterize BRAF-mutant gliomas. Results: Seventeen (4.6%) showed BRAF mutations. Tumor types included 8 glioblastomas, 2 epithelioid glioblastomas (E-GBM), 2 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA), 1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 1 diffuse astrocytoma, and 3 pilocytic astrocytomas. Fifty-three percent (53%) of cases exhibited BRAF-alterations other than p.V600E. The majority of the tumors were localized in the temporal lobe (52.9%). In addition to BRAF mutations, glioblastomas showed concomitant mutations in TP53 (3/8), CDKN2A/B-loss (6/8), TERT-promoter (6/8), and/or PTEN (5/8). Both E-GBMs and PXAs showed CDKN2A/B-loss and BRAF p.V600E with absence of TERTp, TP53, and PTEN mutations. Similar findings were observed in BRAF-mutant infiltrating gliomas from cBioPortal. Conclusions: Knowledge of additional alterations that co-occur with BRAF-mutations in gliomas may improve diagnosis and help identify patients that could benefit from targeted therapies. Furthermore, we provide examples of two patients whose tumors responded to BRAF pathway inhibitors, arguing in favor of these therapies in patients with BRAF-mutant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33009979

Recently, an alternatively spliced form of p15 has been cloned and termed p10 based on the presumed molecular weight of the protein. In this study, we have investigated the role of p10 expression in human glioblastomas. Both, wild-type p15 and p10 were detected in three of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Sixteen of twenty-nine (55%) glioblastoma tumor samples contained INK4b transcripts, but only nine (31%) tumors expressed p15 protein. Three p15 protein-negative tumors expressed only p10 mRNA. Preferential expression of p10 was not due to splice site mutations. Strong suppression of tumorigenicity was seen in four glioblastoma cell lines after transfection with p15 but not with p10. Loss of p15 protein expression was almost always accompanied by loss of p16 expression. p1 6/p15-negative tumors commonly lacked p14ARF expression. These results suggest that differential splicing of the INK4b gene may result in the expression of p10 at the expense of p15, which would lead to loss of p15-mediated growth suppression. This novel mechanism of loss of p15 might complement alterations of the INK4a tumor suppressor gene in some glioblastomas, resulting in combined loss of p16, p15 and p14ARF.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11563632

"""The Phenomenon of Multidrug Resistance in Glioblastomas.""","""The most common and aggressive brain tumor in the adult population is glioblastoma (GBM). The lifespan of patients does not exceed 22 months. One of the reasons for the low effectiveness of GBM treatment is its radioresistance and chemoresistance. In the current review, we discuss the phenomenon of multidrug resistance of GBM in the context of the expression of ABC family transporter proteins and the mechanisms of proliferation, angiogenesis, and recurrence. We focused on the search of molecular targets among growth factors, receptors, signal transduction proteins, microRNAs, transcription factors, proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and their single-nucleotide polymorphisms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34216549
"""Genetic pathways to glioblastoma: a population-based study.""","""We conducted a population-based study on glioblastomas in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (population, 1.16 million) to determine the frequency of major genetic alterations and their effect on patient survival. Between 1980 and 1994, 715 glioblastomas were diagnosed. The incidence rate per 100,000 population/year, adjusted to the World Standard Population, was 3.32 in males and 2.24 in females. Observed survival rates were 42.4% at 6 months, 17.7% at 1 year, and 3.3% at 2 years. For all of the age groups, younger patients survived significantly longer, ranging from a median of 8.8 months (<50 years) to 1.6 months (>80 years). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 10q was the most frequent genetic alteration (69%), followed by EGFR amplification (34%), TP53 mutations (31%), p16(INK4a) deletion (31%), and PTEN mutations (24%). LOH 10q occurred in association with any of the other genetic alterations and was predictive of shorter survival. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas prevailed (95%), whereas secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic gliomas were rare (5%). Secondary glioblastomas were characterized by frequent LOH 10q (63%) and TP53 mutations (65%). Of the TP53 mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57% were in hotspot codons 248 and 273, whereas in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more equally distributed. G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites were more frequent in secondary than primary glioblastomas (56% versus 30%; P = 0.0208). This suggests that the acquisition of TP53 mutations in these glioblastoma subtypes occurs through different mechanisms.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15466178

"""The value of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the 3-D radiation treatment planning of malignant gliomas.""","""Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of positron emission tomography using the glucose analogue fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) on the delineation of the target volume in three-dimensional radiation treatment planning of primary brain tumors. Methods and materials: In 18 patients with histologically proven (8x biopsy, 10x subtotal resection) primary brain tumors (8 astrocytomas grade III, one mixed glioma grade III, and 9 glioblastomas), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium-DTPA and FDG-PET were performed in radiation treatment position within the same week. A computer program was developed for fusion of the PET and MR images. On corresponding axial slices, FDG uptake was compared to contrast enhancement in T1-weighted and to signal hyperintensity in T2-weighted MR images. Based on PET and MRI data, three-dimensional treatment planning was performed. All patients underwent linear accelerator (LINAC) radiotherapy. Results: In MRI, all tumors and the surrounding edema were visible as hyperintense lesions in the T2-weighted images. 17/18 tumors showed contrast enhancement. In FDG-PET, 16 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal white matter, whereas only 8/18 tumors showed hypermetabolism compared to normal gray matter. White matter edema was associated with decreased FDG uptake in all patients. The area of increased FDG uptake correlated closely with contrast enhancement, only in one case the volume of increased FDG uptake was larger than the area of contrast enhancement. Mean tumor volumes obtained by MRI T1 + Gd, T2, and PET were 30, 106, and 10 ml, respectively. Survival was comparable to data in the literature with a 1-year survival of 39% and a median survival of 310 days. Conclusion: Only in a minority of patients did FDG-PET provide additional information for radiation treatment planning. This is mainly caused by the high intensity of FDG uptake in normal brain tissue. PET may be of greater value in the definition of regions that should obtain a radiation dose boost.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9719107
"""The MGMT promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1625649 had prognostic impact on patients with MGMT methylated glioblastoma.""","""Promoter methylation is the most significant mechanism to regulate O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MGMT promoter region may also play a role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of SNPs in the MGMT promoter region of glioblastoma. Genomic DNAs from 118 glioblastomas were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Sanger sequencing was used to sequence the MGMT promoter region to detect SNPs. The results were correlated with MGMT status and patient survival. Rs1625649 was the only polymorphic SNP located at the MGMT promoter region in 37.5% of glioblastomas. Homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) was correlated with a higher MGMT methylation level and a lower protein expression, but the result was not statistically significant. In patients with MGMT methylated glioblastoma, cases with homozygous rs1625649 (AA genotype) were significantly associated with a lack of MGMT protein expression and a better progression-free survival (PFS) than the cases with wild type rs1625649 (CC genotype) or heterozygous rs1625649 (CA genotype).

"""Autophagy, the Trojan horse to combat glioblastomas.""","""Malignant gliomas, among which glioblastomas constitute the largest group, are characterized by a dramatically diffuse infiltration into the brain parenchyma with, as a consequence, the fact that no patient with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been cured to date. Migrating GBM cells are resistant to apoptosis (Type I programmed cell death), and thus to radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy, because of the constitutive activation of several intracellular signaling pathways, of which the most important identified to date are the pathways controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Migrating GBM cells seem to be less prone to resist autophagy (Type II programmed cell death), and disruption of the pathway controlled by mTOR induces marked autophagic processes in GBM cells. Temozolomide is the most efficacious cytotoxic drug employed today to combat glioblastoma, and this drug exerts its cytotoxic activity through proautophagic processes. Thus, autophagy represents a kind of Trojan horse that can be used to bypass, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of glioblastoma to radiotherapy and proapoptotic-related chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16709038

It may rarely show pseudoepithelial components or true epithelial differentiation. Metastasis to glioblastomas have been previously reported, but were unsupported by immunohistochemical or molecular analyses. Herein we describe a glioblastoma with carcinomatous foci in a patient with no past clinical history of tumors outside the central nervous system. The carcinomatous foci expressed epithelial, but not glial markers. Therefore, whole-body imaging was carried out to verify the presence of carcinoma. A lung mass was biopsied and it resulted as primary lung adenocarcinoma. Carcinomatous foci of glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma had the same KRAS mutation which was absent in glial areas of the glioblastoma. Thus, glioblastoma with tumor-to-tumor metastasis was diagnosed. This case demonstrates that, albeit rare, metastases to glioblastoma may occur, and they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of glioblastoma with carcinomatous foci. Even when the past clinical history is negative, the presence of carcinoma should be investigated to rule out glioblastoma with tumor-to-tumor metastasis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31523853
"""Repopulation capacity during fractionated irradiation of squamous cell carcinomas and glioblastomas in vitro.""","""Purpose: Determination of clonogenic cell proliferation of three highly malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and two glioblastoma cell lines during a 20-day course of fractionated irradiation under in vitro conditions. Methods and materials: Tumor cells in exponential growth phase were plated in 24-well plastic flasks and irradiated 24 h after plating with 250 kV x-rays at room temperature. Six fractions with single doses between 0.6 and 9 Gy were administered in 1.67, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. Colony growth was monitored for at least 60 days after completion of irradiation. Wells with confluent colonies were considered as 'recurrences' and wells without colonies as 'controlled.' The dose required to control 50% of irradiated wells (WCD50) was estimated by a logistic regression for the different overall treatment times. The effective doubling time of clonogenic cells (T[eff]) was determined by a direct fit using the maximum likelihood method. Results: The increase of WCD50 within 18.3 days was highly significant for all tumor cell lines accounting for 7.9 and 12.0 Gy in the two glioblastoma cell lines and for 12.7, 14.0, and 21.7 Gy in the three SCC cell lines. The corresponding T(eff)s were 4.4 and 2.0 days for glioblastoma cell lines and 2.4, 4.2, and 1.8 days for SCC cell lines. Population doubling times (PDT) of untreated tumor cells ranged from 1.0 to 1.9 days, showing no correlation with T(eff)s. T(eff) was significantly longer than PDT in three of five tumor cell lines. No significant differences were observed comparing glioblastomas and SCC. Increase of WCD50 with time did not correlate with T(eff) but with T(eff) InSF2 (surviving fraction at 2 Gy). Conclusion: The intrinsic ability of SCC and glioblastoma cells to repopulate during fractionated irradiation could be demonstrated. Repopulation induced dose loss per day depends on T(eff) and intrinsic radiation sensitivity. Proliferation during treatment was decelerated compared to pretreatment PDT in the majority of cell lines. Pretreatment cell kinetics did not predict for tumor cell proliferation during treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9336158
"""Prognostic Value of PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA Ratio in Patients With Primary Glioblastoma (IDH-Wildtype).""","""A hallmark of glioblastoma is the high level of aerobic glycolysis. PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 are regulatory glycolytic enzymes, which are overexpressed in glioblastomas. Selective inhibition of these enzymes has emerged as a new approach in tumor therapy. We investigated the ratios of PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA expression in 66 astrocytic tumors of different malignancy grades. PFKFB3 mRNA levels were considerably higher than those of PFKFB4 in all analyzed tumors. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showed lower PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios (7.7:1) than IDH-mutant low-grade astrocytomas (36.5:1), indicating a dependency of the ratio on malignancy grade. In IDH-wildtype glioblastomas exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PFKFB3 gene locus, the decrease of PFKFB3 mRNA levels was accompanied by lower PFKFB4 mRNA levels, but the PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratio did not differ between tumors with or without PFKFB3 LOH. IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma patients with high PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 mRNA ratios above the average of 7.7:1 had a significantly longer overall survival time (14 months) than patients with lower ratios (9 months). Our results indicate that low PFKFB3 to PFKFB4 expression ratio is a poor prognostic factor in patients with IDH-wildtype primary glioblastoma and that PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 might represent promising targets for astrocytoma and glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31369092
"""Ribozyme-targeting reveals the rate-limiting role of pleiotrophin in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most frequent malignant brain tumors with very limited treatment options and nearly all GBM patients dying within 1 year. Pleiotrophin (PTN, HB-GAM, HBNF, OSF-1) is a secreted growth factor that shows mitogenic, chemotactic and transforming activity. While PTN expression is tightly regulated during embryogenesis and very limited in normal adult tissues, a marked PTN upregulation is seen in tumors including glioblastomas. Targeting of the PTN receptors, ALK and RPTP-zeta, indicates a contribution of PTN-activated signaling pathways in glioblastomas. However, the relevance of PTN expression itself is unknown especially since, besides PTN, at least one more growth factor, midkine (MK), signals through ALK and is expressed in glioblastoma. Here we demonstrate the biologic relevance of PTN in 2 glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. We show that stable ribozyme-targeting leads to a robust reduction of PTN mRNA and protein levels. This results in decreased cell proliferation, cell migration and soft agar colony formation in vitro. Comparing clonal ribozyme-transfected cells with different residual PTN levels, we establish a PTN gene-dose effect of glioblastoma cell proliferation. In a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model, in vivo growth is markedly reduced upon PTN depletion, which is paralleled by decreased PTN serum levels. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors shows reduced angiogenesis in PTN-depleted tumors. We conclude that PTN is a rate-limiting growth factor in glioblastoma. Since PTN is overexpressed in glioblastomas but rarely found in normal tissue, PTN may represent an attractive therapeutic target.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15986444
"""Analysis of the functional role of chromosome 10 loss in human glioblastomas.""","""Molecular and cytogenetic analyses of primary brain tumors have shown that losses on chromosome 10 occur very frequently in human glioblastoma multiforme suggesting the presence of a glioma-associated tumor suppressor gene on this chromosome. To examine this hypothesis, a copy of chromosome 10 derived from a human fibroblast cell line was introduced into the human glioma cell line U251 by microcell-mediated chromosomal transfer. A human chromosome 2 was also independently introduced into U251 cells. The presence of novel chromosomes or chromosomal fragments was confirmed by molecular and karyotypic analyses. The hybrid clones containing a transferred chromosome 10 exhibited a suppression of their transformed and tumorigenic phenotype in vivo and in vitro, whereas cells containing a transferred chromosome 2 failed to alter their phenotype. The hybrid cells containing a transferred chromosome 10 displayed a significant decrease in their saturation density and an altered cellular morphology at high cell density but only a slight decrease in their exponential growth rate. A dramatic decrease was observed in the ability of cells with an introduced chromosome 10 to grow in soft agarose. The introduction of chromosome 10 completely suppressed tumor formation when the hybrid cells were injected into nude mice. These findings indicate that chromosome 10 harbors a tumor suppressor gene that is directly involved in glioma oncogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8104691

We examined relationships of the cellular microenvironment, including astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and blood vessels, to survival in glioblastoma patients. Using histological staining and quantitative image analyses, we examined the tumor-associated parenchyma of 33 patients and developed statistical models to predict patient outcomes based on the cellular picture of the tumor parenchyma. We found that blood vessel density correlated with poorer prognosis. To examine the role of adjacent parenchymal versus higher tumor cell density bulk parenchymal tissue, we examined the glial components in these highly variable regions. Comparison of bulk and adjacent astrocytes and microglia in tissue yielded the strongest prediction of survival, with high levels of adjacent astrocytes predicted poor prognosis and high levels of microglia correlated with a better prognosis. These results indicate that parenchymal components predict survival in glioblastoma patients and in particular that the balance between reactive glial populations is important for patient prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27815396
"""Heat-shock protein vaccines as active immunotherapy against human gliomas.""","""Modern advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to the development of active immunotherapy that utilizes tumor-associated antigens to induce a specific immune response against the tumor. Current methods of immunotherapy implementation are based on the principle that tumor-associated antigens are capable of being processed by antigen-presenting cells and inducing an activated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-specific immune response that targets the tumor cells. Antigen internalization and processing by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, or macrophages results in their surface association with MHC class I molecules, which can be recognized by an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte adaptive immune response. With the aim of augmenting current immunotherapeutic modalities, much effort has been directed towards enhancing antigen-presenting cell activation and optimizing the processing of tumor-associated antigens and major histocompatibility molecules. The goal of these immunotherapy modifications is to ultimately improve the adaptive specific immune response in killing of tumor cells while sparing normal tissues. Immunotherapy has been actively studied and applied in glioblastomas. Preclinical animal models have shown the feasibility of an active immunotherapy approach through the utilization of tumor vaccines, and recently several clinical studies have also been initiated. Recently, endogenous heat-shock proteins have been implicated in the mediation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses.

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a member of the Herpesviridae family, was the first tumoral virus to be described, and several viruses in connection with cancer were discovered thereafter. During the complex interaction between host and EBV, several events take place. In the context of survival, EBV can drive its host cells with subsequent disruption of the cellular machinery, leading to tumorigenesis as the final outcome. Thus, the EBV infection has been associated with different tumors. In this review, we discuss EBV and cancer. We have analyzed previously published papers and have conducted a critical analysis on the role of the viral infection in glioblastoma.

The latter pattern of vascularization indicates an alternative microvascular circulation known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM). However, it remains to be clarified how the GSC-driven VM makes a significant contribution to tumor vasculature. Here, we investigated 11 cases of glioblastomas and found that most of them consisted of blood-perfused vascular channels that coexpress mural cell markers smooth muscle α-actin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Flk-1), but not CD31 or VE-cadherin. This microvasculature coexisted with endothelial cell-associated vessels. GSCs derived from patients with glioblastomas developed vigorous mural cell-associated vascular channels but few endothelial cell vessels in orthotopic animal models. Suppression of Flk-1 activity and gene expression abrogated GSC transdifferentiation and vascularization in vitro, and inhibited VM in animal models.

Surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating agents, including temozolomide are the most common treatment options for glioblastoma. Often, conventional therapies fail to treat these tumors since they develop drug resistance. There is a need for newer agents to combat this deadly tumor. Natural products such as gedunin have shown efficacy in several human diseases. A comprehensive study of gedunin, an heat shock protein (HSP)90 inhibitor, has not been thoroughly investigated in glioblastoma cell lines with different genetic modifications. Aims: A key objective of this study was to determine how gedunin affects the biological and signaling mechanisms in glioblastoma cells, and to determine how those mechanisms affect the proliferation and apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Methods: The viability potentials of gedunin were tested using MTT, cell counts, and wound healing assays. Gedunin's effects on glioma cells were further validated using LDH and colony formation assays. In addition, we investigated the survival and apoptotic molecular signaling targets perturbed by gedunin using Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Results: Our results show that there was a reduction in cell viability and inhibition of wound healing in the cells tested. Western blot analysis of the gene expression data revealed genes such as EGFR and mTOR/Akt/NF kappa B to be associated with gedunin sensitivity. Gedunin treatment induced apoptosis by cleaving poly ADP-ribose polymerase, activating caspases, and downregulating BCL-xL.

They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P=0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However, the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87% of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of glioma cell lines.

In this pilot study, we compared PET imaging with 18F-GE-180 and MRI of patients with untreated and recurrent pretreated glioblastoma. Methods: Eleven patients with histologically confirmed IDH wildtype gliomas (10 glioblastomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma) underwent 18F-GE-180 PET at initial diagnosis or recurrence. The PET parameters mean background uptake (SUVBG), maximal tumour-to-background ratio (TBRmax) and PET volume using different thresholds (SUVBG × 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0) were evaluated in the 60-80 min p.i. summation images. The different PET volumes were compared to the contrast-enhancing tumour volume on MRI. Results: All gliomas were positive on 18F-GE-180 PET and were depicted with extraordinarily high tumour-to-background contrast (median SUVBG 0.47 (0.37-0.93), TBRmax 6.61 (3.88-9.07)). 18F-GE-180 uptake could be found even in areas without contrast enhancement on MRI, leading to significantly larger PET volumes than MRI-based volumes (median 90.5, 74.5, and 63.8 mL vs. 31.0 mL; p = 0.003, 0.004, 0.013). In percentage difference, the PET volumes were on average 179%, 135%, and 90% larger than the respective MRI volumes. The median spatial volumetric correlation (Sørensen-Dice coefficient) of PET volumes and MRI volumes prior to radiotherapy was 0.48, 0.54, and 0.58.

To what extent 18F-GE-180 uptake reflects the tumour extent of human gliomas and inflammatory cells remains to be evaluated in future prospective studies with guided stereotactic biopsies and correlation of histopathological results.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28821920
"""Meningiomas with conventional MRI findings resembling intraaxial tumors: can perfusion-weighted MRI be helpful in differentiation?""","""Introduction: To investigate the contribution of perfusion-weighted MRI to the differentiation of meningiomas with atypical conventional MRI findings from intraaxial tumors. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 54 meningiomas, 12 glioblastomas and 13 solitary metastases. We detected 6 meningiomas with atypical features on conventional MRI resembling intraaxial tumors. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBV) ratios of all tumors were calculated via perfusion-weighted MRI. The signal intensity-time curves were plotted and three different curve patterns were observed. The type 1 curve resembled normal brain parenchyma or the postenhancement part was minimally below the baseline, the type 2 curve was similar to the type 1 curve but with the postenhancement part above the baseline, and the type 3 curve had the postenhancement part below the baseline accompanied by widening of the curve. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: On CBV images meningiomas were hypervascular and the mean rCBV ratio was 10.58+/-2.00. For glioblastomas and metastatic lesions, the rCBV ratios were 5.02+/-1.40 and 4.68+/-1.54, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in rCBV ratios between meningiomas and glioblastomas and metastases (P<0.001). Only one of the meningiomas displayed a type 2 curve while five showed a type 3 curve. Glioblastomas and metastases displayed either a type 1 or a type 2 curve. None of the meningiomas showed a type 1 curve and none of the glioblastomas or metastases showed a type 3 curve. Conclusion: Differentiating meningiomas with atypical conventional MRI findings from malignant intraaxial tumors can be difficult. Calculation of rCBV ratios and construction of signal intensity-time curves may contribute to the differentiation of meningiomas from intraaxial tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16896907
"""Downregulation of CTRP1 reduces radio-resistance in glioblastoma cells by inhibiting the expression of CD133 after X-ray and carbon ion irradiation.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors, present significant challenges due to their invasive nature, high recurrence rates, and limited treatment options. Radiotherapy is a cornerstone in the management of GBMs; however, resistance to treatment poses a substantial obstacle. This study investigates the role of adipokine C1q/TNF-related protein 1 (CTRP1) in the radio-sensitivity of GBMs, utilizing both X-ray and carbon ion irradiation. Expression analyses revealed elevated CTRP1 and CD133 levels in GBMs tissues, which were associated with poor patient survival. Carbon ion irradiation demonstrated superior growth inhibition compared to X-ray, particularly in U87 (high CD133) cells. Moreover, CTRP1 expression increased following radiation exposure, especially after X-ray treatment. Knockdown of CTRP1 enhanced radio-sensitivity by reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis, while exacerbating oxidative stress. Bioinformatics analysis revealed CTRP1's involvement in DNA damage repair pathways. Our findings establish a novel connection between CTRP1 and cellular radio-sensitivity. Targeting CTRP1, especially in U87 (high CD133) cells, enhances GBMs radio-sensitivity, offering potential therapeutic avenues.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39515408

"""Hyperthermic Laser Ablation of Recurrent Glioblastoma Leads to Temporary Disruption of the Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier.""","""Background: Poor central nervous system penetration of cytotoxic drugs due to the blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major limiting factor in the treatment of brain tumors. Most recurrent glioblastomas (GBM) occur within the peritumoral region. In this study, we describe a hyperthemic method to induce temporary disruption of the peritumoral BBB that can potentially be used to enhance drug delivery. Methods: Twenty patients with probable recurrent GBM were enrolled in this study. Fourteen patients were evaluable. MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy was applied to achieve both tumor cytoreduction and disruption of the peritumoral BBB. To determine the degree and timing of peritumoral BBB disruption, dynamic contrast-enhancement brain MRI was used to calculate the vascular transfer constant (Ktrans) in the peritumoral region as direct measures of BBB permeability before and after laser ablation. Serum levels of brain-specific enolase, also known as neuron-specific enolase, were also measured and used as an independent quantification of BBB disruption. Results: In all 14 evaluable patients, Ktrans levels peaked immediately post laser ablation, followed by a gradual decline over the following 4 weeks. Serum BSE concentrations increased shortly after laser ablation and peaked in 1-3 weeks before decreasing to baseline by 6 weeks. Conclusions: The data from our pilot research support that disruption of the peritumoral BBB was induced by hyperthemia with the peak of high permeability occurring within 1-2 weeks after laser ablation and resolving by 4-6 weeks. This provides a therapeutic window of opportunity during which delivery of BBB-impermeant therapeutic agents may be enhanced.

"""Prognostic value of MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation in glioblastomas depends on IDH1 mutation.""","""Several molecular markers have been proposed as predictors of outcome in patients with glioblastomas. We investigated the prognostic significance of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and TP53 mutation status dependent on isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation in glioblastoma patients. A cohort of 78 patients with histologically confirmed glioblastomas treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the prognostic value of MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation status with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). It was revealed that mutations in IDH1, promoter methylation of MGMT, TP53 mutation, age, Karnofsky performance status (KFS), and extension of resection were independent prognostic factors. In patients with an IDH1 mutation, those with an MGMT methylation were associated with longer PFS (p=0.016) and OS (p=0.013). Nevertheless, the presence of TP53 mutation could stratify the PFS and OS of patients with IDH1 wild type (p=0.003 and 0.029 respectively, log-rank). The MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation were associated with a favorable outcome of patients with and without mutant IDH1, respectively. The results indicate that glioblastomas with MGMT methylation or TP53 mutations have improved survival that may be influenced by IDH1 mutation status.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25605197
"""Role of YKL-40 in the angiogenesis, radioresistance, and progression of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is one of the most fatal cancers, characterized by a strong vascularized phenotype. YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, is overexpressed in patients with glioblastomas and has potential as a novel tumor biomarker. The molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in glioblastoma development, however, are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role YKL-40 plays in the regulation of VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and radioresistance. YKL-40 up-regulated VEGF expression in glioblastoma cell line U87, and both YKL-40 and VEGF synergistically promote endothelial cell angiogenesis. Interestingly, long term inhibition of VEGF up-regulated YKL-40. YKL-40 induced coordination of membrane receptor syndecan-1 and integrin αvβ5, and triggered a signaling cascade through FAK(397) to ERK-1 and ERK-2, leading to elevated VEGF and enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, γ-irradiation of U87 cells increased YKL-40 expression that protects cell death through AKT activation and also enhances endothelial cell angiogenesis. Blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of human glioblastomas revealed a correlation between YKL-40, VEGF, and patient survival. These findings have shed light on the mechanisms by which YKL-40 promotes tumor angiogenesis and malignancy, and thus provide a therapeutic target for tumor treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21385870
"""Expression of vascular Notch ligands Delta-like 4 and Jagged-1 in glioblastoma.""","""Aims: The coordinated expression of the Notch ligands Delta-like 4 (Dll4) and Jagged (Jag)1 is believed to define appropriate endothelial sensitivity to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Preclinical data suggest that Dll4-Notch signalling may confer resistance to anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab, and Jag1 may antagonize Dll4-Notch. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression of Dll4 and Jag1 in primary glioblastomas. Methods and results: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40 glioblastomas and normal brain using validated antibodies against Dll4 and Jag1. In-situ hybridization for Dll4 was performed on serial sections and compared with protein expression. Dll4 expression was localized to the cytoplasm and membrane of endothelial cells in all glioblastomas; it was weak or absent in normal brain. Jag1 expression was observed in the cytoplasm and membrane of glomeruloid and non-glomeruloid endothelial cells from 76% and 67% of glioblastomas, respectively. However, endothelial Jag1 expression was less intense and less prevalent than Dll4. There was no association between Dll4 and Jag1 expression. Conclusions: In summary, Dll4 and Jag1 are expressed in glioblastoma vasculature. These data may define subsets of glioblastoma that might be sensitive (Dll4(+) /Jag1(+) ) or resistant (Dll4(+) /Jag1(-) ) to bevacizumab. Our data also suggest that anti-Dll4 therapy should be evaluated experimentally in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296176
"""Ki-67 Proliferative Activity in the Tumor Margins as a Robust Prognosis Factor in Glioblastoma Patients.""","""Introduction: The infiltrative margin of glioblastomas (GBM) contains proliferative tumor cells difficult to estimate radiologically as they are included in the hyperintense signal of T2 sequences and they remain in the cavity margin after tumor resection. The amount of these cells could determine overall survival (OS) of these patients. Material and methods: From October 2007 to January 2010, patients whose MRI were suggestive of newly diagnosed, resectable high-grade glioma were operated using fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). Separate samples were selectively taken from nonfluorescent white matter areas just adjacent to the border of the pale fluorescence and staining was made for Ki-67. OS was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Multivariate analysis included the following prognosis variables: age, extent of resection (EOR), O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, and performance status index. Results: Sample included 65 patients, comprising 37 men and 28 women, with a median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of 80 (40-100) and mean age of 60 (34-78) years. Mean preoperative tumor volume was 35.8 mL. EOR was 100% in 52 patients (80%), with the lower EOR being 88%. For Ki-67, 39 patients had <5% and 26 had ≥5%. OS was 26.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.9-28.2) for the Ki-67 low group versus 15.8 months (95% CI: 7.7-18.2) for the Ki-67 high group (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Proliferative activity in the normal-looking brain around the resection cavity measured with Ki-67 immunostaining is an important independent prognostic factor for GBM cases with complete resection of enhancing tumor.

"""Vulnerability of invasive glioblastoma cells to lysosomal membrane destabilization.""","""The current clinical care of glioblastomas leaves behind invasive, radio- and chemo-resistant cells. We recently identified mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/FABP3) as a biomarker for invasive gliomas. Here, we demonstrate a novel function for MDGI in the maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity, thus rendering invasive glioma cells unexpectedly vulnerable to lysosomal membrane destabilization. MDGI silencing impaired trafficking of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cells resulting in significant alterations in the lipid composition of lysosomal membranes, and subsequent death of the patient-derived glioma cells via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). In a preclinical model, treatment of glioma-bearing mice with an antihistaminergic LMP-inducing drug efficiently eradicated invasive glioma cells and secondary tumours within the brain. This unexpected fragility of the aggressive infiltrating cells to LMP provides new opportunities for clinical interventions, such as re-positioning of an established antihistamine drug, to eradicate the inoperable, invasive, and chemo-resistant glioma cells from sustaining disease progression and recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31068339

They are implicated in tumorigenesis and function both as tumor suppressors and as oncogenes. The clinical significance of miRNA expression profiles in malignant gliomas remains unclear. Experimental design: In this study, we examined the expression levels of 365 mature human miRNAs in 12 malignant gliomas, including 8 glioblastomas and 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR arrays. A validation study was done to corroborate a subset of the results, including expression levels of miR-196a, -196b, -21, and -15b, by analyzing 92 malignant gliomas by conventional real-time PCR. We modeled the relationship between the expression levels of these miRNAs and the survival rate of 39 glioblastoma patients by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis. Results: Expression profiles in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas suggested that 16 miRNAs were candidate markers associated with the malignant progression of gliomas. Among them, miR-196a showed the most significant difference (P = 0.0038), with miR-196b also having a high significance (P = 0.0371). Both miRNAs showed increased expression levels in glioblastomas relative to both anaplastic astrocytomas and normal brains in the validation study. Furthermore, patients with high miR-196 expression levels showed significantly poorer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method (P = 0.0073). Multivariate analysis showed that miR-196 expression levels were an independent predictor of overall survival in all 39 glioblastoma patients (P = 0.021; hazard ratio, 2.81). Conclusions: Our results suggest that miR-196 may play a role in the malignant progression of gliomas and may be a prognostic predictor in glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20601442

Our model identified Annexin A2 (ANXA2) as a novel methylation-controlled positive regulator of the mesenchymal subtype. Subsequent evaluation in two independent cohorts established ANXA2 expression as a prognostic factor that is dependent on ANXA2 promoter methylation. ANXA2 knockdown in primary glioblastoma stem cell-like cultures suppressed known mesenchymal master regulators, and abrogated cell proliferation and invasion.

Samples from 59 patients (37 males, 22 females, age 55.1 ± 17.1 years) suffering from primary (n = 35), recurrent (n = 18), and secondary (n = 6) glioblastomas were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry for expression levels of SphK1 and SphK2 and S1P1-3 and S1P5. Sixteen autopsy nontumorous brain specimens were used as controls. Expression data was correlated with clinical data and patient survival. All markers were overexpressed in the glioblastoma specimens compared to the non-neoplastic brain tissue. SphK1 and all S1P receptors were expressed in increasing order of magnitude from primary, up to recurrent and secondary glioblastomas, with values of up to 44-fold compared to normal brain tissue. In contrast, SphK2 levels were highest in primary tumors (25-fold). Expression of the sphingosine signaling pathway components was influenced by radio/radiochemotherapy in distinct ways. Immunohistochemistry for SphK1 and S1P1 confirmed the overexpression in glioblastoma. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses identified S1P5 messenger RNA levels as an independent prognostic factor of survival. The sphingosine pathway is overexpressed in glioma.

Their clinical features, immunohistochemical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were evaluated to determine treatment tolerance and identify prognostic factors. Results: Among the 70 included patients, the median survival time was 15 months. In the univariate analysis, patients who underwent a gross total resection had longer overall survival times than patients who had a subtotal resection (P < 0.05), and patients who received postoperative adjuvant therapy had longer overall survival times than those with no postoperative adjuvant therapy (P < 0.05). The expression of the p53 protein significantly affected overall survival. Patients with low p53 protein expression had a median survival of 17 months, whereas those who had high p53 protein expression had a median survival of 11.50 months (P < 0.05). Undergoing a gross total resection, receiving postoperative adjuvant therapy and having low p53 protein expression were factors that independently contributed to longer overall survival times in multivariate analysis.

The extremely unfavorable prognosis for patients suffering from glioblastomas (GBMs) is strongly correlated to the intrinsic apoptosis resistance of GBM cells which especially occurs in diffusely migrating tumor cells. The ultimate goal for molecular, apoptosis-based therapies is to target specific components of the two major apoptotic pathways, i.e. the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway to trigger tumor-selective apoptosis, while at the same time limiting toxicity in normal tissues. Induction of autophagic cell death (type II cell death) by pro-autophagic drugs is an alternative and emerging concept to trigger glioma cell death and to exploit caspase-independent programmed cell death pathways for the development of novel glioma therapies.

Only a small number of patients survive 3 years. The factors of a favorable prognosis for the 'longevity phenomenon' in glioblastoma patients are not fully understood. Objective: to determine the occurrence rate of long-living patients with glioblastomas, identify clinical predictors of a favorable prognosis, and identify the presence and prognostic significance of an IDH1 mutation. Material and methods: Among 1494 patients operated on for glioblastoma at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute from 2007 to 2012, there were 84 (5.6%) patients who lived more than 3 years after primary surgery. In all the cases, histological specimens were reviewed, and immunohistochemical detection of a mutant IDH1 protein was performed. Overall survival was calculated from the time of first surgery to the date of the last consultation or death, and the recurrence-free period was calculated from the time of first surgery to MRI-verified tumor progression. Results: The median age of long-living patients with glioblastoma was 45 years (19-65 years). All tumors were located supratentorially. The median Karnofsky performance status score at the time of surgery was 80 (range, 70-100). All patients underwent microsurgical resection of the tumor, followed by chemoradiotherapy. The median recurrence-free period was 36 months (5-98 months). Overall survival of 48, 60, and 84 months was achieved in 23, 15 and 6% of patients, respectively.

Results: Mean maximum f was significantly higher in the glioblastoma group than in the atypical PCNSL group (reader 1, 0.101 ± 0.016 [standard deviation] vs 0.021 ± 0.010; P < .001; reader 2: 0.107 ± 0.024 vs 0.027 ± 0.015; P < .001). Mean minimum D did not significantly differ between the two groups (reader 1, P = .202; reader 2, P = .091). By using maximum f as a discriminative index, respective sensitivity and specificity were 89.5% and 95.1% for reader 1 and 84.2% and 95.1% for reader 2. There was a significant positive correlation between maximum f and the corresponding nCBV (r = 0.68; P < .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient between readers was highest for measurement of maximum f (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.92). Conclusion: IVIM imaging can be used as a noninvasive imaging method to differentiate malignant brain tumors that show similar conventional MR imaging features.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24697149
"""[Clinical and pathological significance of p53 gene mutation in human cerebral glioblastoma multiforme].""","""Cerebral glioblastomas multiforme (GMs), the most malignant human primary brain tumor, molecular genetically comprise two subsets characterized by p53 tumor suppressor gene status. One is characterized by p53 mutation and another is with wild-type p53 and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We analyzed the p53 status by a highly reliable yeast-based assay, overexpression of EGFR by immunohistochemistry, and their relations to clinical outcome along with other several clinical parameters, in a total of 42 patients with GMs. We found p53 mutations in 18 cases (43%) of 42 GMs and overexpression of EGFR in 16 cases (43%) of 37 GMs. The tumors with p53 mutation were associated with younger onset ages and longer survival. We also analyzed their survival and radiation sensitivity relative to p53 status, EGFR and other prognostic factors, including onset age, extent of surgery, post-operative Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and location of tumor. Log-rank tests showed that younger onset ages (below 50 years; p < 0.0111), p53 mutation (p < 0.0005), superficial tumor location (p < 0.0026) and post operatives KPS (over 80%; p < 0.0147) correlated with longer survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the absence of p53 mutation (p < 0.0335) and the deep tumor location (p < 0.0297) as the independent, adverse prognostic factors. Tumor response to radiation was assessed by progression-free period (time to progression; TTP). A significant correlation was found between TTP and survival (p < 0.0001). Log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that younger onset ages (below 50 years; p < 0.0145), p53 mutation (p < 0.0001), radical resection (p < 0.0198) and post operative KPS (over 80%; p < 0.0001) correlated with radiation sensitivity, and identified the absence of p53 mutation (p < 0.0146) as the sole independent hazard for radiation response. In conclusion, p53 mutation confers radiation sensitivity in GMs, which results in patients' longer survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9828926
"""Quantitative T1-mapping detects cloudy-enhancing tumor compartments predicting outcome of patients with glioblastoma.""","""Contrast enhancement of glioblastomas (GBM) is caused by the decrease in relaxation time, T1. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative measurement of T1 (qT1) discovers a subtle enhancement in GBM patients that is invisible in standard MRI. We assessed the volume change of this 'cloudy' enhancement during radio-chemotherapy and its impact on patients' progression-free survival (PFS). We enrolled 18 GBM patients in this observational, prospective cohort study and measured 3T-MRI pre- and post contrast agent with standard T1-weighted (T1w) and with sequences to quantify T1 before radiation, and at 6-week intervals during radio-chemotherapy. We measured contrast enhancement by subtracting pre from post contrast contrast images, yielding relative signal increase ∆T1w and relative T1 shortening ∆qT1. On ∆qT1, we identified a solid and a cloudy-enhancing compartment and evaluated the impact of their therapy-related volume change upon PFS. In ∆qT1 maps cloudy-enhancing compartments were found in all but two patients at baseline and in all patients during therapy. The qT1 decrease in the cloudy-enhancing compartment post contrast was 21.64% versus 1.96% in the contralateral control tissue (P < 0.001). It was located at the margin of solid enhancement which was also seen on T1w. In contrast, the cloudy-enhancing compartment was visually undetectable on ∆T1w. A volume decrease of more than 21.4% of the cloudy-enhancing compartment at first follow-up predicted longer PFS (P = 0.038). Cloudy-enhancing compartment outside the solid contrast-enhancing area of GBM is a new observation which is only visually detectable with qT1-mapping and may represent tumor infiltration. Its early volume decrease predicts a longer PFS in GBM patients during standard radio-chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27891815
"""The sodium pump alpha1 subunit as a potential target to combat apoptosis-resistant glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To review the involvement of the ion transporter Na+/K+-ATPase (NaK) in the migration and proliferation of glioma cells. Preliminary studies indicate that NaK alpha1 subunits seem to be upregulated in a proportion of glioblastomas but not in normal brain tissues. Design: The present review focuses on (1) the natural resistance of migrating malignant glioma cells to apoptosis, (2) autophagic cell death as an alternative to combat malignant gliomas, (3) the fact that reducing the levels of malignant glioma cell motility can restore proapoptotic drug sensitivity,and (4) on the observation that inhibiting the NaK activity reduces both glioma cell proliferation and migration. Results: The natural ligands of the NaK are the cardiotonic steroids. A hemisynthetic derivative of 2'-oxovoruscharin (UNBS1450), a novel cardenolide, displays unique structural features, making its binding affinity to NaK alpha subunits (including alpha1) 10 to 100 times higher than that of other cardenolides. UNBS1450 markedly decreases intracellular ATP concentration in glioma cells, disorganizes the actin cytoskeleton, and leads to autophagic cell death in NaK alpha1 over-expressing glioma cells. Conclusions: Glioblastoma patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and whose tumors over-express NaK alpha1 subunits could benefit from a treatment using ligands with marked binding affinity for the NaK alpha1 subunit.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18323016
"""Genome-wide hypomethylation in human glioblastomas associated with specific copy number alteration, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase allele status, and increased proliferation.""","""Genome-wide reduction in 5-methylcytosine is an epigenetic hallmark of human tumorigenesis. Experimentally induced hypomethylation in mice promotes genomic instability and is sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis. Here, we report that global hypomethylation is common in primary human glioblastomas [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] and can affect up to an estimated 10 million CpG dinucleotides per haploid tumor genome. Demethylation involves satellite 2 (Sat2) pericentromeric DNA at chromosomes 1 and 16, the subtelomeric repeat sequence D4Z4 at chromosomes 4q and 10q, and interspersed Alu elements. Severe hypomethylation of Sat2 sequences is associated with copy number alterations of the adjacent euchromatin, suggesting that hypomethylation may be one factor predisposing to specific genetic alterations commonly occurring in GBMs. An additional apparent consequence of global hypomethylation is reactivation of the cancer-testis antigen MAGEA1 via promoter demethylation, but only in GBMs and GBM cell lines exhibiting a 5-methylcytosine content below a threshold of approximately 50%. Primary GBMs with significant hypomethylation tended to be heterozygous or homozygous for the low-functioning Val allele of the rate-limiting methyl group metabolism gene methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), or had a deletion encompassing this gene at 1p36. Tumors with severe genomic hypomethylation also had an elevated proliferation index and deletion of the MTHFR gene. These data suggest a model whereby either excessive cell proliferation in the context of inadequate methyl donor production from MTHFR deficiency promotes genomic hypomethylation and further genomic instability, or that MTHFR deficiency-associated demethylation leads to increased proliferative activity in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16951158

"""Intraoperative Spectroscopy with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Image-Guided Surgery of Malignant Brain Tumors.""","""Intraoperative cancer imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery have attracted considerable interest because fluorescence signals can provide real-time guidance to assist a surgeon in differentiating cancerous and normal tissues. Recent advances have led to the clinical use of a natural fluorophore called protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) for image-guided surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors (glioblastomas). However, traditional fluorescence imaging methods have only limited detection sensitivity and identification accuracy and are unable to detect low-grade or diffuse infiltrating gliomas (DIGs). Here we report a low-cost hand-held spectroscopic device that is capable of ultrasensitive detection of protoporphyrin IX fluorescence in vivo, together with intraoperative spectroscopic data obtained from both animal xenografts and human brain tumor specimens. The results indicate that intraoperative spectroscopy is at least 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current surgical microscopes, allowing ultrasensitive detection of as few as 1000 tumor cells. For detection specificity, intraoperative spectroscopy allows the differentiation of brain tumor cells from normal brain cells with a contrast signal ratio over 100. In vivo animal studies reveal that protoporphyrin IX fluorescence is strongly correlated with both MRI and histological staining, confirming that the fluorescence signals are highly specific to tumor cells. Furthermore, ex vivo spectroscopic studies of excised brain tissues demonstrate that the hand-held spectroscopic device is capable of detecting diffuse tumor margins with low fluorescence contrast that are not detectable with current systems in the operating room. These results open new opportunities for intraoperative detection and fluorescence-guided resection of microscopic and low-grade glioma brain tumors with invasive or diffusive margins.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26587976

We examined the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and p21 in 35 human primary glioblastomas in relation to tumor proliferation potential as assessed by the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) and the glioblastoma apoptosis index (AI). The expression of mutant p53 was observed in 74% of glioblastomas, wild-type p53 in 18% of glioblastomas, and p21 in 57% of glioblastomas. p21 expression was seen in 15 of 26 mutant p53-positive and 2 of 4 wild p53-positive tumors. Tumor Ki-67 LI correlated neither with p53 nor with p21 expression in glioblastomas. Apoptosis was identified in all 15 glioblastomas examined, with a mean (+/-SD) Al of 1.69+/-1.54, and correlated neither with p53 (wild or mutant) nor with p21 expression. The results of the present study suggest that p53 mutation and p21 protein expression are frequent in primary glioblastoma but lack correlation with tumor proliferation potential and apoptosis. The lack of correlation between p21 and p53 also suggests that p21 in glioblastomas may be induced by a p53-independent pathway.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10328545

Polymerase chain reaction was performed and the products were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel. As many as 16 of the 19 samples (84%) exhibited LOH. Three of the 7 informative loci (43%) showed LOH at D9S54, 7 of 17 (41%) at IFNA, 8 of 14 (57%) at D9S171, 7 of 14 (50%) at D9S104, 4 of 8 (50%) at D9S165, and 2 of 7 (29%) at D9S166.

Methods: IPD was reconstructed using the R package IPDfromKM. Pooled IPD Kaplan-Meier charts of survival stratified by Lev therapy were created using the R package Survminer. One- and two-stage meta-analyses of Lev treatment regarding survival was performed. Results: Three articles covering 825 patients were included out of 3567 screened records. Lev usage prevalence was 0.36. IPD from 590 IDH wild-type glioblastomas, with a median follow-up of 16.1 months, were utilized.

However, the role of underlying genetic risk factors remains largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discover whether genetic aberrations in glioblastoma associate with VTE risk. Methods: In this cohort study, all consecutive patients diagnosed with glioblastoma in two Dutch hospitals between February 2017 and August 2020 were included. Targeted DNA next-generation sequencing of all glioblastomas was performed for diagnostic purposes and included mutational status of the genes ATRX, BRAF, CIC, FUBP1, H3F3A, IDH1, IDH2, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 and amplification/gain or deletion of BRAF, CDKN2A, EGFR, NOTCH1 and PTEN. The primary outcome was VTE within three months before glioblastoma diagnosis until two years after. Cumulative incidences were determined using competing risk analysis adjusting for mortality. Univariable Cox regression analysis was performed to determine hazard ratios. Results: From 324 patients with glioblastoma, 25 were diagnosed with VTE. Patients with a CDKN2A deletion had a 12-month adjusted cumulative incidence of VTE of 12.5 % (95%CI: 7.3-19.3) compared with 5.4 % (95%CI: 2.6-9.6) in patients with CDKN2A wildtype (p = 0.020), corresponding to a HR of 2.53 (95%CI: 1.12-5.73, p = 0.026). No significant associations were found between any of the other investigated genes and VTE. Conclusion: This study suggests a potential role for CDKN2A deletion in glioblastoma-related VTE.

ADH1A3 has been implicated in the regulation of stemness and radioresistance mediated by glioblastoma stem cells. Mechanisms by which ALDH1A3 promotes malignant progression of glioblastoma remain elusive posing a challenge for rationalization of ALDH1A3 targeting in glioblastoma, and it is also unclear how ALDH1A3 regulates glioblastoma cells stemness. Usage of different models with diverse genetic backgrounds and often unknown degree of stemness is one possible reason for discrepant views on the role of ALDH1A3 in glioblastoma stem cells. This study clarifies ALDH1A3 impacts on glioblastoma stem cells by modelling ALDH1A3 expression in an otherwise invariable genetic background with consideration of the impacts of inherent plasticity and proliferative changes associated with transitions between cell states. Our main finding is that ALDH1A3 exerts cell-state dependent impact on proliferation of glioblastoma stem cells.

"""Glioblastoma hijacks microglial gene expression to support tumor growth.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and lethal primary brain tumors. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, survey their environment and respond to pathogens, toxins, and tumors. Glioblastoma cells communicate with microglia, in part by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite the presence of large numbers of microglia in glioblastoma, the tumors continue to grow, and these neuroimmune cells appear incapable of keeping the tumor in check. To understand this process, we analyzed gene expression in microglia interacting with glioblastoma cells. Methods: We used RNASeq of isolated microglia to analyze the expression patterns of genes involved in key microglial functions in mice with glioblastoma. We focused on microglia that had taken up tumor-derived EVs and therefore were within and immediately adjacent to the tumor. Results: We show that these microglia have downregulated expression of genes involved in sensing tumor cells and tumor-derived danger signals, as well as genes used for tumor killing. In contrast, expression of genes involved in facilitating tumor spread was upregulated. These changes appear to be in part EV-mediated, since intracranial injection of EVs in normal mice led to similar transcriptional changes in microglia. We observed a similar microglial transcriptomic signature when we analyzed datasets from human patients with glioblastoma. Conclusion: Our data define a microgliaGlioblastoma specific phenotype, whereby glioblastomas have hijacked gene expression in the neuroimmune system to favor avoiding tumor sensing, suppressing the immune response, clearing a path for invasion, and enhancing tumor propagation.

Development of effective therapeutic strategies against GSCs requires both specificity of targeting and intracranial penetration through the blood-brain barrier. We have previously demonstrated the use of in vitro and in vivo phage display biopanning strategies to isolate glioblastoma targeting peptides. Here we selected a 7-amino acid peptide, AWEFYFP, which was independently isolated in both the in vitro and in vivo screens and demonstrated that it was able to target GSCs over differentiated glioma cells and non-neoplastic brain cells. When conjugated to Cyanine 5.5 and intravenously injected into mice with intracranially xenografted glioblastoma, the peptide localized to the site of the tumor, demonstrating intracranial tumor targeting specificity. Immunoprecipitation of the peptide with GSC proteins revealed Cadherin 2 as the glioblastoma cell surface receptor targeted by the peptides. Peptide targeting of Cadherin 2 on GSCs was confirmed through ELISA and in vitro binding analysis. Interrogation of glioblastoma databases demonstrated that Cadherin 2 expression correlated with tumor grade and survival. These results confirm that phage display can be used to isolate unique tumor-targeting peptides specific for glioblastoma.

Cytogenetically, karyotypes of glioblastomas are very complex with trisomy 7 and monosomy 10 as the most frequent abnormalities. A genetic alteration that is significantly more frequent in primary than in secondary glioblastomas, the latter arising from preceding low-grade gliomas, is epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) amplification, whereas TP-53 mutations are significantly more frequent in low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas derived there- from. We report the histological and genetic study of two glioblastomas, one case arising de novo and the other case arising 3 years after a previously diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma, with concurrent EGFR amplification and TP-53 mutation.

At the molecular level, a rare mutation of TP-53 was found in the secondary glioblastoma and hypermethylation of the promoter region of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) genes were observed in the primary and secondary glioblastoma, respectively.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17907599
"""TPPP3 promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Snail1 in glioblastoma.""","""Tubulin polymerization promoting protein 3 (TPPP3), a member of the tubulin polymerization family, participates in cell progressions in several human cancers, its biological function and the underlying mechanisms in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role and application value of TPPP3 in gliomas and found that the expression of TPPP3 in glioma was higher than that in normal brain tissue (NBT), and increased with the grade of glioma. Up-regulation of TPPP3 expression in glioblastoma cells confer stronger ability of migration, invasion, proliferation and lower apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of TPPP3 expression in GBM could reduce the migration, invasion, proliferation and induce the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. TPPP3 affected the process of EMT by regulating the expression of Snail 1 protein. In clinical data analysis, we found a positive correlation between TPPP3 and Snail1 protein expression levels in glioblastomas. Low TPPP3 expression leads to better survival expectations in glioblastomas patients. The content of this study paves the way for further in-depth exploration of the role of TPPP3 in glioblastoma in the future, and provides new treatment and research directions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37863960
"""Survival signalling and apoptosis resistance in glioblastomas: opportunities for targeted therapeutics.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults and one of the most aggressive cancers in man. Despite technological advances in surgical management, combined regimens of radiotherapy with new generation chemotherapy, the median survival for these patients is 14.6 months. This is largely due to a highly deregulated tumour genome with opportunistic deletion of tumour suppressor genes, amplification and/or mutational hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors. The net result of these genetic changes is augmented survival pathways and systematic defects in the apoptosis signalling machinery. The only randomised, controlled phase II trial conducted targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling with the small molecule inhibitor, erlotinib, has showed no therapeutic benefit. Survival signalling and apoptosis resistance in GBMs can be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Targeting increased survival is unlikely to be efficacious without at the same time targeting apoptosis resistance. We have critically reviewed the literature regarding survival and apoptosis signalling in GBM, and highlighted experimental, preclinical and recent clinical trials attempting to target these pathways. Combined therapies simultaneously targeting apoptosis and survival signalling defects might shift the balance from tumour growth stasis to cytotoxic therapeutic responses that might be associated with greater therapeutic benefits.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515495
"""Increased (14)C-acetate accumulation in IDH-mutated human glioblastoma: implications for detecting IDH-mutated glioblastoma with (11)C-acetate PET imaging.""","""Purpose: Recently, the potential value of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation as a prognostic marker in glioblastomas has been established. Glioblastomas are classified by their IDH mutation status under the 2016 WHO classification system. However, noninvasive diagnostic methods for the mutation status in glioblastoma patients have not been established so far. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference of acetate metabolism between in glioblastomas with wild-type IDH and in those with IDH mutation by comparing the uptake of 14C-acetate using genetically engineered glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We established glioblastoma cells (U251) expressing IDH1 R132H and examined the cell uptake of [1-14C]acetate. Biodistribution studies and an autoradiographic study for U251 cell tumor-bearing mice (BALB/c-nu/nu) with or without the IDH1 mutation were performed 1 h after [1-14C]acetate administration. Results: Significantly higher uptake of [1-14C]acetate was observed in U251/IDH1 R132H cells than in U251/IDH1 wild-type cells both in vitro (10.11 ± 0.94 vs. 4.26 ± 0.95%dose/mg, p = 0.0047) and in vivo (0.97 ± 0.14 vs. 0.66 ± 0.05%ID/g; p = 0.0037). Tumor-to-muscle ratios were also significantly higher in U251/IDH1 R132H tumors (3.36 ± 0.41 vs. 1.88 ± 0.59, p = 0.0030). The autoradiographic study shows the entirely higher radioactivity of the U251/IDH1 R132H tumor tissue section than that of the U251/IDH1 Wild-type tumor. Conclusions: In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the uptake of radiolabeled acetate was significantly higher in IDH-mutated cells than in IDH-wild-type cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31667733
"""Prognostic validation of a new classification system for extent of resection in glioblastoma: A report of the RANO resect group.""","""Background: Terminology to describe extent of resection in glioblastoma is inconsistent across clinical trials. A surgical classification system was previously proposed based upon residual contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor. We aimed to (1) explore the prognostic utility of the classification system and (2) define how much removed non-CE tumor translates into a survival benefit. Methods: The international RANO resect group retrospectively searched previously compiled databases from 7 neuro-oncological centers in the USA and Europe for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma per WHO 2021 classification. Clinical and volumetric information from pre- and postoperative MRI were collected. Results: We collected 1,008 patients with newly diagnosed IDHwt glioblastoma. 744 IDHwt glioblastomas were treated with radiochemotherapy per EORTC-26981/22981 (TMZ/RT→TMZ) following surgery. Among these homogenously treated patients, lower absolute residual tumor volumes (in cm3) were favorably associated with outcome: patients with 'maximal CE resection' (class 2) had superior outcome compared to patients with 'submaximal CE resection' (class 3) or 'biopsy' (class 4). Extensive resection of non-CE tumor (≤5 cm3 residual non-CE tumor) was associated with better survival among patients with complete CE resection, thus defining class 1 ('supramaximal CE resection'). The prognostic value of the resection classes was retained on multivariate analysis when adjusting for molecular and clinical markers. Conclusions: The proposed 'RANO categories for extent of resection in glioblastoma' are highly prognostic and may serve for stratification within clinical trials. Removal of non-CE tumor beyond the CE tumor borders may translate into additional survival benefit, providing a rationale to explicitly denominate such 'supramaximal CE resection.'""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35961053

We investigated whether glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines preserve the expression phenotype of human glioblastomas more closely than conventional glioma cell lines. Expression profiling revealed that a distinct subset of GS lines, which displayed a full stem-like phenotype (GSf), mirrored the expression signature of glioblastomas more closely than either other GS lines or cell lines grown in serum. GSf lines are highly tumorigenic and invasive in vivo, express CD133, grow spherically in vitro, are multipotent and display a Proneural gene expression signature, thus recapitulating key functional and transcriptional aspects of human glioblastomas. In contrast, GS lines with a restricted stem-like phenotype exhibited expression signatures more similar to conventional cell lines than to original patient tumors, suggesting that the transcriptional resemblance between GS lines and tumors is associated with different degrees of 'stemness'. Among markers overexpressed in patient tumors and GSf lines, we identified CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target. GSf lines contained a minor population of CXCR4(hi) cells, a subfraction of which coexpressed CD133 and was expandable by hypoxia, whereas conventional cell lines contained only CXCR4(lo) cells. Convection-enhanced local treatment with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the highly invasive growth of GS xenografts in vivo and cell migration in vitro. We thus demonstrate the utility of GSf lines in testing therapeutic agents and validate CXCR4 as a target to block the growth of invasive tumor-initiating glioma stem cells in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21294158

Proteases play a major role in the invasion process and correlations between glioma grading, survival and protease expression have been demonstrated. In this study, we have chosen to study using different technical approaches (Q-RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry) the expression of five molecules involved in extracellular matrix degradation (cathepsin B, MMP2, MMP9, uPA and PAI-1) in glioblastomas in order to determine their prognostic impact among grade IV gliomas. Pilocytic astrocytomas were used as controls. Q-RT-PCR showed that transcripts of uPA, PAI-1, cathepsin B and MMP9 were significantly more expressed in glioblastomas (n = 52), in comparison to pilocytic astrocytomas (n = 17) (P = 0.049, P < 0.0001, P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively). On both univariate and multivariate analyses, cathepsin B and PAI-1 were strong predictors of overall survival among the group of glioblastomas (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.01, respectively). Immunohistochemical expression of cathepsin B further confirmed its prognostic value in an independent cohort of patients with glioblastoma. In situ hybridization showed that uPA is detected at the invasive edge of glioblastomas, whereas PAI-1 is more abundant in microvascular proliferation and pseudo-palisading cells than at the infiltrative edges. These results suggest that cathepsin B and PAI-1 are important biomarkers for the stratification of glioblastoma patients with respect to survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19774387

In malignant gliomas it increases with malignancy, even though in glioblastomas it does not seem to correlate with outcome. Materials and methods: Survivin was immunohistochemically studied in 39 selected viable glioblastoma areas belonging to 20 cases which were assayed for apoptosis, using a TUNEL assay, caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1), Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) and with the proliferation index Ki-67/MIB-1 and mitotic index (MI). Results: A positive linear correlation was found between the survivin labelling index (LI) and the Ki-67/MIB-1 LI and MI. No inverse correlation was found with apoptosis. Conclusion: This double behavior can be attributed to mechanisms mediating survivin activity, either as a mitosis regulator and apoptosis inhibitor, and should be taken into account in therapeutic strategies using survivin.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18383832

Vessel density was determined by labelling of endothelia with von Willebrand factor. Response to chemotherapy correlated positively with cell density (p < 0.05) and negatively with CD44 over-expression (p < 0.02). Further, a positive correlation between age and CD44 expression (p < 0.05) and a negative correlation between age and p53 accumulation (p < 0.01) was found.

"""Periventricular glioblastomas and ependymal involvement interrogated using intraoperative fluorescence - a pathological correlative study.""","""Rationale: Subventricular zone (SVZ) involvement has been proposed as an adverse prognostic factor in glioblastomas (GBM). The true extent of ventricular involvement at surgery is often difficult to establish and is poorly studied. Tumour fluorescence provides us with an exciting opportunity to interrogate tumour extent intraoperatively. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all cases of GBMs operated using aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence and analyzed radiological SVZ involvement alongwith the incidence of ventricular entry at surgery, ependymal fluorescence and histological correlation of the ependymal involvement. Results: Of 30 GBMs, radiological SVZ involvement was seen in 26 of which ventricles were opened at surgery in 19. Diffuse ependymal fluorescence was seen in 10 of the 19 cases (51%) and histology revealed tumour infiltration in only one of the five cases where ependymal tissue was sampled. Focal ependymal fluorescence seen in two of the 19 cases was always pathological. Diffuse ependymal fluorescence did not always correlate with gross appearance of the ventricular lining at surgery. Nor did it correlate with SVZ involvement. Conclusions: Pathological significance of diffusely fluorescing ependymal lining seen during surgery is questionable and need not represent tumour extension. Ependymal fluorescence may sometimes not be visualized even when the tumour appears to involve the SVZ. These results highlight the potential limitations of fluorescence especially in the bordering infiltrating zone where its predictive value is diminished.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27648634

Loss of retinoblastoma expression was associated with a worse outcome, which appeared to be independent of age. There was no significant association between chromosome 10 loss or DCC protein expression and survival.

As such, MGMT is gaining increasing traction in diagnosis, prognostication, and therapeutic decision-making for these highly malignant gliomas. Although, MGMT promotor methylation status is becoming more commonly used in neuro-oncology; this test remains imperfect. Because of its increasing use in clinical practice and research, it is integral that we are aware of its pitfalls and complications. Currently, there are many ways to detect a patient's MGMT promotor methylation status, including: quantitative PCR, methylation-specific PCR, pyrosequencing, real time PCR with high resolution melt, and the infinitum methylation EPIC beadChip. The technical aspects, shortcomings, and optimal approach to interpreting the results of each method will be discussed. Furthermore, given that none of these methods have been prospectively validated, the challenge of equivocal cases will be discussed, and technical and logistic strategies for overcoming these challenges will be proposed.

Results and conclusions: Glioblastomas show strikingly more YKL-40 expression than anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Only 2 of 37 glioblastomas showed completely negative YKL-40 staining in both tumor cells and extracellular matrix, whereas 18 of 29 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were completely negative in non-microgemistocytic tumor cells and extracellular matrix. Tumor cell staining intensity was also markedly different: 84% of glioblastomas showed strong staining intensities of 2+ or 3+ whereas 76% of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas either did not stain or stained at only 1+. YKL-40 staining provided a better class distinction of glioblastoma versus anaplastic oligodendroglioma than glial fibrillary acidic protein, the current standard immunohistochemical marker used to distinguish diagnostically challenging gliomas.

Patients with GBM have a median survival of 14 months and a 5-year survival of less than 5%, a grim statistic that has remained unchanged over the last 50 years. GBM is intransigent for a variety of reasons. The immune system has a difficult time mounting a response against glioblastomas because they reside in the brain (an immunologically dampened compartment) and generate few neoantigens relative to other cancers. Glioblastomas inhabit the brain like sand in the grass and display a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, impeding efforts to therapeutically target a single pathway. Of all potential therapeutic strategies to date, virotherapy offers the greatest chance of counteracting each of the obstacles mounted by GBM. Virotherapy can xenogenize a tumor that is deft at behaving like 'self', triggering adaptive immune recognition in an otherwise immunologically quiet compartment. Viruses can also directly lyse tumor cells, creating damage and further stimulating secondary immune reactions that are detrimental to tumor growth.

However, there is lack of a clear consensus regarding the expression of some markers in the literature. Therefore, an immunohistochemical study was performed to determine the prognostic significance of Ki67, p53, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a retrospective series of 63 glioblastomas. Image analysis was carried out in positive specimens to quantify the immunoprecipitates. p53 and EGFR expression were specifically addressed in the 36 primary glioblastomas reported in this series.

The results showed that in this series of glioblastomas, none of these markers had any prognostic value. Among the clinical parameters, a high KPS before surgery was found to be indicative of a shorter DFST and survival time (P < 0.05), whereas a younger age at onset and total or subtotal surgical excision were associated with a longer survival (P < 0.001 and 0.05, respectively). EGFR protein accumulation was inversely correlated with p53 accumulation (P = 0.01).

Gene expression was collected from multiple independent datasets. Patients were categorized as responders/nonresponders based on their survival status at 16 months postsurgery. For each gene, the expression was compared between responders and nonresponders with a Mann-Whitney U-test and receiver operating characteristic. The package 'roc' was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). The integrated database comprises 454 GBM patients from 3 independent datasets and 10 103 genes. The highest proportion of responders (68%) were among patients treated with TMZ combined with nitrosoureas, where FCGR2B upregulation provided the strongest predictive value (AUC = 0.72, P < 0.001). Elevated expression of CSTA and MRPS17 was associated with a lack of response to multiple treatment strategies. DLL3 upregulation was present in subsequent responders to any treatment combination containing TMZ. Three genes (PLSCR1, MX1 and MDM2) upregulated both in the younger cohort and in patients expressing low MGMT delineate a subset of patients with worse prognosis within a population generally associated with a favorable outcome.

This study investigated the mechanism of L1CAM regulation in GBM cells and its role in the mediation of chemoresistance. L1CAM expression levels varied in GBM cells being highest in A172 cells and low in T98G cells. Inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling in A172 cells reduced L1CAM expression and vice versa stimulation with exogenous TGF-β1 led to upregulation of L1CAM in T98G cells. Additionally, TGF-β1 and L1CAM expression increased during differentiation of glioma stem-like cells. L1CAM expressing GBM cells and differentiated glioma stem-like cells showed a reduced apoptotic response after treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of L1CAM in A172 cells and differentiated glioma stem-like cells increased chemosensitivity, whereas overexpression of L1CAM in T98G cells and glioma spheroids diminished the apoptotic response. Elevated L1CAM expression caused a diminished expression of caspase-8 in GBM and differentiated glioma stem-like cells. These data show that TGF-β1 dependent upregulation of L1CAM expression in GBM cells leads to the downregulation of caspase-8 and apoptosis resistance pointing to L1CAM as potential target for improved therapy of GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22948185

In this study, we assessed the frequency of PTEN mutations in primary glioblastomas, which developed clinically de novo, and in secondary glioblastomas, which evolved from low-grade (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III). Nine of 28 (32%) primary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation and an additional case showed a homozygous PTEN deletion.

Mechanistically, MSLCs are reprogrammed by the CD40L/CD40/NFκB2 signalling axis to build a tumour infiltrative microenvironment involving collagen crosslinking. Importantly, blocking of CD40L by a neutralizing antibody-suppressed LOX expression and ECM remodelling, decreasing GBM infiltration in mouse xenograft models. Clinically, high expression of CD40L, clusters of differentiation 40 (CD40) and LOX correlated with poor survival in patients with glioma. This indicated that GBM-educated MSLCs promote GBM infiltration via ECM remodelling in the tumour microenvironment. Conclusion: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the pro-infiltrative tumour microenvironment produced by GBM-educated MSLCs and highlight a potential therapeutic target that can be used for suppressing GBM infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35908277
"""Neuroplasticity in glioblastoma: there is more to plasticity than just low grade glioma.""","""Neuroplasticity is well established in low grade glioma patients. Less is known about functional plasticity in glioblastomas. A 56-year-old lady presented with a recurrent speech deficit seventeen months after her initial craniotomy for a language eloquent glioblastoma (GBM). Pre-operative navigated trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (n-TMS) for language mapping, tractography and intra-operative language mapping were performed. During her second admission, preoperative n-TMS revealed positive responses anterior and posterior to the tumour recurrence. Tractography revealed a decrease in the anterior extension of the Arcuate Fasciculus (AF) in the inferior frontal gyrus and a more anterior component of the Frontal-Aslant Tract (FAT) showed anterior to the tumour itself. A second resection was carried out and the patient was discharged with no language deficit for second line treatment with Lomustine. Intraoperatively, speech arrest was found in a new position posterior to the previous surgical cavity and away from tumour recurrence (where speech arrest was previously located). This case report shows language function neuroplasticity in glioblastoma. This is supported by preoperative cortical and subcortical mapping.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39668322
"""SDF-1 Blockade Enhances Anti-VEGF Therapy of Glioblastoma and Can Be Monitored by MRI.""","""Despite the approval of antiangiogenic therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, survival benefits are still limited. One of the resistance mechanisms for antiangiogenic therapy is the induction of hypoxia and subsequent recruitment of macrophages by stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1α (CXCL-12). In this study, we tested whether olaptesed pegol (OLA-PEG, NOX-A12), a novel SDF-1α inhibitor, could reverse the recruitment of macrophages and potentiate the antitumor effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. We also tested whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent could provide early information on macrophage blockade. Orthotopic human G12 glioblastomas in nude mice and rat C6 glioblastomas were employed as the animal models. These were treated with bevacizumab or B-20, both anti-VEGF antibodies. Rats were MR imaged with ferumoxytol for macrophage detection. Tumor hypoxia and SDF-1α expression were elevated by VEGF blockade. Adding OLA-PEG to bevacizumab or B-20 significantly prolonged the survival of rodents bearing intracranial GBM compared with anti-VEGF therapy alone. Intratumoral CD68+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) were increased by VEGF blockade, but the combination of OLA-PEG + VEGF blockade markedly lowered TAM levels compared with VEGF blockade alone. MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent noninvasively demonstrated macrophage reduction in OLA-PEG + anti-VEGF-treated rats compared with VEGF blockade alone. In conclusion, inhibition of SDF-1 with OLA-PEG inhibited the recruitment of TAMs by VEGF blockage and potentiated its antitumor efficacy in GBM. Noninvasive MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent provides early information on the effect of OLA-PEG in reducing TAMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940247

"""Co-expression of TIMP-1 and its cell surface binding partner CD63 in glioblastomas.""","""Background: We have previously identified tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) as a prognostic marker in glioblastomas. TIMP-1 has been associated with chemotherapy resistance, and CD63, a known TIMP-1-binding protein, has been suggested to be responsible for this effect. The aim of this study was to assess CD63 expression in astrocytomas focusing on the prognostic potential of CD63 alone and in combination with TIMP-1. Methods: CD63 expression was investigated immunohistochemically in a cohort of 111 astrocytomas and correlated to tumor grade and overall survival by semi-quantitative scoring. CD63 expression in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was examined by double-immunofluorescence with ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). The association between CD63 and TIMP-1 was investigated using previously obtained TIMP-1 data from our astrocytoma cohort. Cellular co-expression of TIMP-1 and CD63 as well as TIMP-1 and the tumor stem cell-related markers CD133 and Sox2 was investigated with immunofluorescence. TIMP-1 and CD63 protein interaction was detected by an oligonucleotide-based proximity ligation assay and verified using co-immunoprecipitation. Results: The expression of CD63 was widely distributed in astrocytomas with a significantly increased level in glioblastomas. CD63 levels did not significantly correlate with patient survival at a protein level, and CD63 did not augment the prognostic significance of TIMP-1. Up to 38% of the CD63+ cells expressed Iba1; however, Iba1 did not appear to impact the prognostic value of CD63. A significant correlation was found between TIMP-1 and CD63, and the TIMP-1 and CD63 proteins were co-expressed at the cellular level and located in close molecular proximity, suggesting that TIMP-1 and CD63 could be co-players in glioblastomas. Some TIMP-1+ cells expressed CD133 and Sox2. Conclusion: The present study suggests that CD63 is highly expressed in glioblastomas and that TIMP-1 and CD63 interact. CD63 does not add to the prognostic value of TIMP-1. Co-expression of TIMP-1 and stem cell markers as well as the wide expression of CD63 might suggest a role for TIMP-1 and CD63 in glioblastoma stemness.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29523123

Recent findings: The appropriate initial evaluation and accurate diagnosis of gliomas require an understanding of the spectrum of clinical and radiographic presentations. Recent advances in the understanding of distinct molecular prognostic subtypes have led to major revisions in the diagnostic classification of gliomas. Integration of these new diagnostic and molecular classifications is an important part of the modern management of gliomas and facilitates better understanding and interpretation of the efficacy of different therapies in specific glioma subtypes.

"""Auger electron therapy of glioblastoma using [(125)I]5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and concomitant chemotherapy - Evaluation of a potential treatment strategy.""","""Introduction: Treatment of glioblastomas (GBM) using the Auger electron emitting compound [125I]5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ([125I]I-UdR), combined with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor methotrexate (MTX) and concomitant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has recently shown very promising therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo in animals. The aim of the current study was to investigate if the therapeutic effects of this multimodal treatment strategy could be further increased by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (F-UdR), in comparison to MTX, and if the co-treatment should be given in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Methods: A patient-derived GBM cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched cell line, grown as neurospheres, was employed to evaluate DNA-incorporation of [125I]I-UdR, determined by a DNA precipitation assay, using either pre-treatment or co-treatment with MTX or F-UdR. The therapeutic effects in the CSC-enriched cell line after exposure to various combinations of MTX, F-UdR, TMZ and [125I]I-UdR were also investigated by a CellTiter-Blue assay. Results: The highest general increase in [125I]I-UdR incorporation was observed with F-UdR co-treatment, which resulted in approx. 2.5-fold increase in the DNA-associated activity. Also the cell viability was significantly decreased when F-UdR was combined with [125I]I-UdR compared to [125I]I-UdR alone at all activity concentrations tested. MTX was redundant when combined with 400 and 500 Bq/ml [125I]I-UdR. TMZ was effective in combination with either [125I]I-UdR alone or with both thymidylate synthase inhibitors combined with 50-100 Bq/ml [125I]I-UdR. Conclusions: Overall, our study revealed a higher incorporation and therapeutic effect of [125I]I-UdR when GBM cells were co-treated with F-UdR compared to MTX. The therapeutic effects were further increased when TMZ was combined with [125I]I-UdR in combination with the thymidylate synthase inhibitors. Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: Auger electron therapy in combination with thymidylate synthase inhibition and concomitant chemotherapy has the potential to become a future therapeutic treatment option for patients with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33784592
"""Endocan expression and localization in human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly malignant tumors characterized by microvascular proliferation and the pseudopalisading pattern of necrosis. Investigations have, therefore, focused on vascular and endothelial cell biology in GBM. Endocan, also called endothelial cell-specific molecule-1, is a proteoglycan that is secreted by endothelial cells and upregulated by proangiogenic factors. We found that endocan is not only expressed in vitro by endothelial cells but also in the T98G and U118MG human GBM cell lines. In U118MG cells, tumor necrosis factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 upregulated endocan production, whereas exposure to hypoxia or cobalt chloride, an inducer of hypoxia inducible factor 1, increased endocan release without affecting cell viability. Endocan expression in 82 brain tumors was studied by immunohistochemistry. Endocan immunoreactivity was detected in hyperplastic endothelial cells in high-grade gliomas, mostly at the tumor margins; endothelial cells were mostly endocan negative in low-grade gliomas, and it was never detected in the cerebral cortex distant from the tumors. Tumor cells in high-grade but not low-grade gliomas also expressed endocan, and it was detected in palisading cells surrounding areas of necrosis in GBM. Endothelial cell endocan immunoreactivity also correlated with shorter survival in glioma patients. Taken together, these results suggest that endocan is associated with abnormal vasculature in high-grade gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19458546

"""Neurosurgical management and prognosis of patients with glioblastoma that progresses during bevacizumab treatment.""","""Background: The management and prognosis of glioblastoma patients after Stupp protocol treatment and progression during bevacizumab (BV) treatment remain undefined. Objective: We compared the morbidity and survival of patients whose glioblastomas progressed during BV treatment requiring craniotomy with those of patients not treated with BV. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent craniotomy for recurrent glioblastoma from 2005 to 2009. Patients operated on for progression during BV (preoperative BV) were compared with patients receiving no BV or receiving BV after surgery (postoperative BV). Patients receiving BV preoperatively were compared with those patients whose gliobastoma progressed on BV treatment but were not operated on (no surgery). Results: There were 23 preoperative BV patients, 135 no BV patients, 16 postoperative BV patients, and 25 no surgery patients. Patients receiving BV preoperatively had a worse postoperative overall survival rate (hazard ratio, 3.1; P < .001) and worse postoperative progression-free survival rate (hazard ratio, 3.4, P < .001) than patients not receiving BV. Patients receiving BV preoperatively had a higher perioperative morbidity rate (44%) than patients not receiving preoperative BV (21%) (P = 0.02). Survival after diagnosis was comparable between groups (86-93 weeks, P = .9), consistent with glioblastomas developing BV evasion being not intrinsically more aggressive, but possibly BV evasion conferring a uniquely poor prognosis. No surgery patients had a shorter overall survival after progression during BV treatment compared with preoperative BV patients (hazard ratio, 3.6, P < .001). Conclusion: Patients whose glioblastomas progress while receiving BV leading to craniotomy exhibit shorter postoperative survival and more perioperative morbidity than patients not treated with BV. Although there may be benefits to surgical debulking, the decision to pursue repeat surgery in patients in whom BV treatment failed must be balanced against the increased risk of perioperative complications.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21841523
"""DNA Methylation-based Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are the most common primary central nervous system malignancy tumor in adults. Glioblastoma patients have poor prognosis, with an average survival period of approximately 14 mo after diagnosis. To date, there are a limited number of effective treatment methods for glioblastoma, and its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this article, we analyzed the key biomarkers and pathways in glioblastoma patients based on gene expression and DNA methylation datasets. The 60 hypomethylated/upregulated genes and 110 hypermethylated/downregulated genes were identified in GSE50923, GSE50161, and GSE116520 microarrays. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these methylated-differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in collagen fibril organization, chemical synaptic transmission, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and GABAergic synapse. The hub genes were screened from a protein-protein interaction network; in selected genes, increased NMB mRNA level was associated with favorable overall survival, while elevated CHI3L1, POSTN, S100A4, LOX, S100A11, IGFBP2, SLC12A5, VSNL1, and RGS4 mRNA levels were associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 expressions were negatively correlated with their corresponding methylation status. Furthermore, the receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that CHI3L1, S100A4, LOX, and S100A11 can also serve as highly specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for glioblastoma patients. Collectively, our study revealed the possible methylated-differentially expressed genes and associated pathways in glioblastoma and identified four DNA methylation-based biomarkers of glioblastoma. These results may provide insight on diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic targets in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510239
"""Zika virus and brain cancer: Can Zika be an effective treatment for brain cancer? A systematic review.""","""Introduction: Many studies have highlighted the use of oncolytic viruses as a new class of therapeutic agents for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, especially glioblastomas (GMB). Zika Virus (ZIKV) proteins targeted to specific stem cells have been studied in vitro and animal models with promising results. Materials and methods: A systematic review was evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ZIKV use for CNS tumors treatment. Data were extracted and the in vivo studies were evaluated using the Robins-I tool. We assessed bias in each study using criteria such as selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and others. According to Cochrane guidelines, bias was classified as high, low, or uncertain. High bias occurred when studies did not meet the criteria. Low bias was assigned when criteria were clearly met. Uncertain bias reflected insufficient information for a clear classification. Results: The 14 included studies shown that ZIKV reduced cell viability or inhibited the growth, proliferation of glioma stem cells (GSCs), and Bcl2 expression - which could potentially enhance the effect of chemotherapy/radiotherapy; caused cytopathic effects, induced tumor cell damage, manifested oncolytic properties, and even selectively safely killed GSCs; ultimately, it led to significant tumor remission and enhanced long-term survival through enhanced T-cell response. Conclusions: Although current evidence suggests ZIKV as a promising treatment for CNS tumors and may improve survival when combined with surgery and radiotherapy. Despite limited human evidence, it shows potential benefits. Further research is needed to confirm safety, efficacy, and optimize treatment in humans.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347716
"""High dose hyperfractionated radiotherapy for adults with glioblastomas.""","""From 1989 to 1991, 27 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma of the brain were treated with radiotherapy.

The remaining 12 were treated with whole brain irradiation (40 Gy of total conventionally fractionated dose) and a localised boost to a total dose of 60 Gy. The hyperfractionated regimen was well tolerated and there was no sign of increased brain oedema to indicate the insertion of a split. Of six patients who received a NTD10 (normalised total dose for alpha/beta = 10) higher than 71 Gy, five showed CR (83% CR rate) versus three of 21 patients who received a lower NTD10 (14% CR rate). For 13 patients who received a NTD10 higher than 66 Gy, the 18-months survival was 61% (8/13) versus 28% (4/14) for 14 patients who received a NTD10 less than 66 Gy. As far as the late morbidity is concerned, of six patients treated with 76-92 Gy of physical dose, none died because of radiation-induced brain necrosis within 18-42 months of follow-up, and three of them are without evidence of disease 18-31 months after the end of radiation treatment. None of our 15 patients who received less than whole brain irradiation relapsed outside the radiation portals. The present study strongly suggests the use of limited volume hyperfractionated radiotherapy schemes, so as to increase the local tumor dose (NTD10) to values higher than 79 Gy, at the same time keeping the NTD2 (NTD for alpha/beta = 2) below 68 Gy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8280367

"""Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics reveal cancer-associated fibroblasts in glioblastoma with protumoral effects.""","""Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were presumed absent in glioblastoma given the lack of brain fibroblasts. Serial trypsinization of glioblastoma specimens yielded cells with CAF morphology and single-cell transcriptomic profiles based on their lack of copy number variations (CNVs) and elevated individual cell CAF probability scores derived from the expression of 9 CAF markers and absence of 5 markers from non-CAF stromal cells sharing features with CAFs. Cells without CNVs and with high CAF probability scores were identified in single-cell RNA-Seq of 12 patient glioblastomas. Pseudotime reconstruction revealed that immature CAFs evolved into subtypes, with mature CAFs expressing actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (ACTA2). Spatial transcriptomics from 16 patient glioblastomas confirmed CAF proximity to mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), endothelial cells, and M2 macrophages. CAFs were chemotactically attracted to GSCs, and CAFs enriched GSCs. We created a resource of inferred crosstalk by mapping expression of receptors to their cognate ligands, identifying PDGF and TGF-β as mediators of GSC effects on CAFs and osteopontin and HGF as mediators of CAF-induced GSC enrichment. CAFs induced M2 macrophage polarization by producing the extra domain A (EDA) fibronectin variant that binds macrophage TLR4. Supplementing GSC-derived xenografts with CAFs enhanced in vivo tumor growth.

Violacein, a purple pigment produced by Chromobacterium violaceum, was investigated in the present study for its anti-tumor properties in tumor cell lines. Clinically applicable concentrations of violacein were demonstrated to inhibit the proliferative capacity of tumor cell lines according to a crystal violet proliferation assay. The underlying mechanism was the promotion of apoptotic cell death, as indicated by poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling determined by western blot analysis. Collectively, this provided mechanistic evidence that violacein elicits extracellular-signal regulated kinase-induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. The anti-malignant properties of violacein in the present study were further demonstrated by its inhibitory effects on brain tumor cell migration, specifically glioblastomas, one of the most invasive and therapeutically resistant neoplasms in the clinic. Additionally, solid tumors examined in the present study displayed differential cellular responses and sensitivities to violacein as observed by morphologically induced cellular changes that contributed to its anti-migratory properties.

Overall survival was 14 and 25 months for patients with percentages of methylation below and above the median, respectively. In contrast, MGMT status determined by Q-RT-PCR and IHC showed little or no correlation with overall survival, respectively.

"""Microglia induce an interferon-stimulated gene expression profile in glioblastoma and increase glioblastoma resistance to temozolomide.""","""Aims: Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumour. Even with standard treatment comprising surgery followed by radiation and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains incurable. Almost all patients with glioblastoma relapse owing to various intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms of the tumour cells. Glioblastomas are densely infiltrated with tumour-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs). These immune cells affect the tumour cells in experimental studies and are associated with poor patient survival in clinical studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of microglia on glioblastoma chemo-resistance. Methods: We co-cultured patient-derived glioblastoma spheroids with microglia at different TMZ concentrations and analysed cell death. In addition, we used RNA sequencing to explore differentially expressed genes after co-culture. Immunostaining was used for validation. Results: Co-culture experiments showed that microglia significantly increased TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cells. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of a clear interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression signature in the glioblastoma cells after co-culture with microglia, including genes such as IFI6, IFI27, BST2, MX1 and STAT1. This ISG expression signature is linked to STAT1 signalling, which was confirmed by immunostaining. The ISG expression profile observed in glioblastoma cells with enhanced TMZ resistance corresponded to the interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) described in different solid cancers. Conclusions: Here, we show that the IRDS signature, linked to chemo-resistance in other cancers, can be induced in glioblastoma by microglia. ISG genes and the microglia inducing the ISG expression could be promising novel therapeutic targets in glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39558550
"""Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) is regulated by miR-125b and mediates VEGF-induced angiogenesis in glioblastoma.""","""In patients with glioblastomas, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Glioblastomas are notorious for their capacity to induce neovascularization, driving continued tumor growth. Here we report that miR-125b is down-regulated in glioblastoma-associated endothelial cells, resulting in increased expression of its target, myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), a transcription factor that regulates VEGF. The down-regulation of miR-125b was also observed on exposure of endothelial cells to glioblastoma-conditioned medium or VEGF, resulting in increased MAZ expression. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of MAZ accumulation by miR-125b, or by MAZ-specific shRNAs, attenuated primary human brain endothelial cell migration and tubule formation in vitro, phenomena considered to mimick angiogenic processes in vitro. Moreover, MAZ expression was elevated in brain blood vessels of glioblastoma patients. Altogether these results demonstrate a functional feed-forward loop in glioblastoma-related angiogenesis, in which VEGF inhibits the expression of miR-125b, resulting in increased expression of MAZ, which in its turn causes transcriptional activation of VEGF. This loop is functionally impeded by the VEGF receptor inhibitor vandetanib, and our results may contribute to the further development of inhibitors of tumor-angiogenesis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22415301
"""Epigenetic dynamics in cancer stem cell dormancy.""","""Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases despite significant advances of early diagnosis and therapeutic treatments. Cancerous tumors are composed of various cell types including cancer stem cells capable of self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and invasion of distal tumor sites. Most notably, these cells can enter a dormant cellular state that is resistant to conventional therapies. Thereby, cancer stem cells have the intrinsic potential for tumor initiation, tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor relapse after therapy. Both genetic and epigenetic alterations are attributed to the formation of multiple tumor types. This review is focused on how epigenetic dynamics involving DNA methylation and DNA oxidations are implicated in breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme. The emergence and progression of these cancer types rely on cancer stem cells with the capacity to enter quiescence also known as a dormant cellular state, which dictates the distinct tumorigenic aggressiveness between breast cancer and glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32394305
"""Phage display discovery of novel molecular targets in glioblastoma-initiating cells.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary intrinsic brain tumor and remains incurable despite maximal therapy. Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing glioma-initiating cells (GICs) at the apex. To discover new GIC targets, we used in vivo delivery of phage display technology to screen for molecules selectively binding GICs that may be amenable for targeting. Phage display leverages large, diverse peptide libraries to identify interactions with molecules in their native conformation. We delivered a bacteriophage peptide library intravenously to a glioblastoma xenograft in vivo then derived GICs. Phage peptides bound to GICs were analyzed for their corresponding proteins and ranked based on prognostic value, identifying VAV3, a Rho guanine exchange factor involved tumor invasion, and CD97 (cluster of differentiation marker 97), an adhesion G-protein-coupled-receptor upstream of Rho, as potentially enriched in GICs. We confirmed that both VAV3 and CD97 were preferentially expressed by tumor cells expressing GIC markers. VAV3 expression correlated with increased activity of its downstream mediator, Rac1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), in GICs. Furthermore, targeting VAV3 by ribonucleic acid interference decreased GIC growth, migration, invasion and in vivo tumorigenesis. As CD97 is a cell surface protein, CD97 selection enriched for sphere formation, a surrogate of self-renewal. In silico analysis demonstrated VAV3 and CD97 are highly expressed in tumors and inform poor survival and tumor grade, and more common with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Finally, a VAV3 peptide sequence identified on phage display specifically internalized into GICs. These results show a novel screening method for identifying oncogenic pathways preferentially activated within the tumor hierarchy, offering a new strategy for developing glioblastoma therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24832468

"""Fluid attenuation in non-contrast-enhancing tumor (nCET): an MRI Marker for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation in Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: The WHO 2016 update classifies glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) according to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status. We aimed to determine MRI-based metrics for predicting IDH mutation in glioblastoma. Methods: This retrospective study included glioblastoma cases (n = 199) with known IDH mutation status and pre-operative MRI (T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced T1W1 at minimum). Two neuroradiologists determined the following MRI metrics: (1) primary lobe of involvement (frontal or non-frontal); (2) presence/absence of contrast-enhancement; (3) presence/absence of necrosis; (4) presence/absence of fluid attenuation in the non-contrast-enhancing tumor (nCET); (5) maximum width of peritumoral edema (cm); (6) presence/absence of multifocal disease. Inter-reader agreement was determined. After resolving discordant measurements, multivariate association between consensus MRI metrics/patient age and IDH mutation status was determined. Results: Among 199 glioblastomas, 16 were IDH-mutant. Inter-reader agreement was calculated for contrast-enhancement (ĸ = 0.49 [- 0.11-1.00]), necrosis (ĸ = 0.55 [0.34-0.76]), fluid attenuation in nCET (ĸ = 0.83 [0.68-0.99]), multifocal disease (ĸ = 0.55 [0.39-0.70]), and primary lobe (ĸ = 0.85 [0.80-0.91]). Mean difference for peritumoral edema width between readers was 0.3 cm [0.2-0.5], p < 0.001. Multivariate analysis uncovered significant associations between IDH-mutation and fluid attenuation in nCET (OR 82.9 [19.22, ∞], p < 0.001), younger age (OR 0.93 [0.86, 0.98], p = 0.009), frontal lobe location (OR 11.08 [1.14, 352.97], p = 0.037), and less peritumoral edema (OR 0.15 [0, 0.65], p = 0.044). Conclusions: Conventional MRI metrics and patient age predict IDH-mutation status in glioblastoma. Among MRI markers, fluid attenuation in nCET represents a novel marker with high inter-reader agreement that is strongly associated with Glioblastoma, IDH-mutant.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33661425
"""What effects does awake craniotomy have on functional and survival outcomes for glioblastoma patients?""","""Purpose: Neurosurgeons adopt several different surgical approaches to deal with glioblastomas (GB) located in or near eloquent areas. Some attempt maximal safe resection by awake craniotomy (AC), but doubts persist concerning the real benefits of this type of surgery in this situation. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the extent of resection (EOR), functional and survival outcomes after AC of patients with GB in critical locations. Methods: Forty-six patients with primary GB treated with the Stupp regimen between 2004 and 2019, for whom brain mapping was feasible, were included. We assessed EOR, postoperative language and/or motor deficits three months after AC, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Complete resection was achieved in 61% of the 46 GB patients. The median PFS was 6.8 months (CI 6.1; 9.7) and the median OS was 17.6 months (CI 14.8; 34.1). Three months after AC, more than half the patients asymptomatic before surgery remained asymptomatic, and one third of patients with symptoms before surgery experienced improvements in language, but not motor functions. The risk of postoperative deficits was higher in patients with preoperative deficits or incomplete resection. Furthermore, the presence of postoperative deficits was an independent predictive factor for shorter PFS. Conclusion: AC is an option for the resection of GB in critical locations. The observed survival outcomes are typical for GB patients in the Stupp era. However, the success of AC in terms of the recovery or preservation of language and/or motor functions cannot be guaranteed, given the aggressiveness of the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33394262
"""Matrix-degrading proteases ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (disintegrins and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs 4 and 5) are expressed in human glioblastomas.""","""Brain tumors, in particular glioblastomas, have a high morbidity and mortality, mainly due to their invasive nature. A prerequisite for this invasiveness is cell migration based on increased expression of proteases digesting the extracellular matrix. Brevican, an important extracellular proteoglycan that is upregulated in glioblastomas, can be degraded by certain proteases. We demonstrate that in human glioblastomas secretory proteases like ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 (aggrecanases 1 and 2; ADAMTS = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) are expressed on the mRNA and protein levels in considerable amounts. Real-time RT-PCR shows a higher levels of ADAMTS4 and 5 expressions in glioblastomas in situ, compared to cultured human glioblastoma cells. The upregulation of these proteases in vivo by cytokines may explain this difference. In vitro, transforming growth factor-beta induces ADAMTS4, but less ADAMTS5, and interleukin-1beta ADAMTS5, but not ADAMTS4. As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy in situ, ADAMTS5 expression is confined to proliferating glioblastoma cells of surgical tumor sections and with lower intensity to astroglial cells in normal brain sections, as opposed to brevican. In vitro, glioblastoma-derived ADAMTS5 degrades recombinant human brevican to several smaller fragments. Our results show that ADAMTS4 and 5 are upregulated on proliferating glioblastoma cells and these proteases may contribute to their invasive potential.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16003758
"""Cytoplasmic localization of wild-type p53 in glioblastomas correlates with expression of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein.""","""Cytoplasmic accumulation of wild-type p53 in tumor cells indicates that the tumor suppressor is inactive with regard to growth suppressive functions. Whether this occurs randomly during tumor development or characterizes a certain tumor cell subset is not known. Here we assayed primary glioblastomas for expression and subcellular localization of p53 and determined a correlation with expression of intermediate filament proteins characterizing glial cell development. Sixty-nine percent of the tumors were p53 positive in immunohistochemistry. A significant number of tumors (23%) accumulated wild-type p53 in the cytoplasm, which correlated with the presence of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein, except for 1 case. Tumors with exclusive nuclear p53 contained none or only one of these intermediate filament proteins. In an alternative approach, tumors positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein were screened for expression of p53 and vimentin. Thirty-eight percent of these tumors showed cytoplasmic p53, and all of those also expressed vimentin. Tumors with only nuclear p53 were vimentin negative, except for 1 case. No mutation was detected in p53 exons 5 to 8 in tumors with cytoplasmic p53, suggesting that they express wild-type p53. The data indicate that a cytoplasmic accumulation of wild-type p53 in human primary glioblastomas correlates with a certain intermediate filament protein expression, suggesting that it identifies a certain subset of tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12084347
"""Two distinct tumor phenotypes isolated from glioblastomas show different MRS characteristics.""","""We have developed a human brain tumor model in immunodeficient rats that gradually changes its phenotype by serial passages in vivo, from a highly infiltrative, non-angiogenic one with numerous stem cell markers [low-generation (LG) tumor] to a more typical glioblastoma one with extensive angiogenesis and necrosis [high-generation (HG) tumor]. In this study we determined the metabolic properties of these two phenotypes, using (1)H MRS. The LG tumors showed an intact blood-brain barrier and normal vascular morphology, as shown by MRI and Hoechst staining. In contrast, the HG tumors exhibited vascular leakage and necrosis. The animals with HG tumor had raised concentrations of choline and myo-inositol, and decreased concentrations of glutamate and N-acetylaspartate. In the LG tumor group, similar changes in metabolic concentrations were detected, although the alterations were more pronounced. The LG tumors also had higher concentrations of choline, taurine, and lactate. Subdividing the LG and HG tumors into large and small tumors revealed a significant increase in choline and decrease in glutamate as the LG tumors increased in size. Our results show that metabolic profiles produced by (1)H MRS can be used to distinguish between two distinct glioblastoma phenotypes. More pronounced anaerobic metabolism was present in the LG stem-cell-like tumors, suggesting a more malignant phenotype.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18613001
"""The zinc finger transcription factor ZFX is required for maintaining the tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma stem cells.""","""Glioblastomas are highly lethal brain tumors containing tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs). The molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the GSC phenotype are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger and X-linked transcription factor (ZFX) maintains GSC self-renewal and tumorigenic potential by upregulating c-Myc expression. ZFX is differentially expressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioma cells and neural progenitor cells. Disrupting ZFX by shRNA reduced c-Myc expression and potently inhibited GSC self-renewal and tumor growth. Ectopic expression of c-Myc to its endogenous level rescued the effects caused by ZFX disruption, supporting that ZFX controls GSC properties through c-Myc. Furthermore, ZFX binds to a specific sequence (GGGCCCCG) on the human c-Myc promoter to upregulate c-Myc expression. These data demonstrate that ZFX functions as a critical upstream regulator of c-Myc and plays essential roles in the maintenance of the GSC phenotype. This study also supports that c-Myc is a dominant driver linking self-renewal to malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24831540
"""EGFR gene amplification in glioblastomas. Is there a relationship with morphology of tumor cell nuclei and proliferative activity?""","""Objective: To confirm a relationship between histomorphology of glioblastomas and amplification of the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as the most important molecular biologic alteration in these tumors. Study design: In paraffin sections of surgical specimens from 71 primary resected glioblastomas, tumor cell nuclei in the region with the highest proliferative activity (Ki-67 immunostaining) were investigated morphometrically. Shape variables (roundness factor, Fourier amplitudes) and nuclear area were measured. Additionally, the numerical density of Ki-67-positive tumor cell nuclei was estimated. Differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from paraffin sections of the same tumor area. The signals for the EGFR gene and IFN gamma reference gene were quantified densitometrically. Results: Cases with distinct EGFR gene amplification (EGFR/IFN ratios > 5) revealed significantly lower mean values for several Fourier amplitudes, indicating a more regular nuclear shape when compared with cases without evidence of EGFR gene amplification (EGFR/IFN-ratios < or = 1). The Ki-67 index and nuclear area showed no significant differences between these groups. Although a large variation in nuclear morphology was observed for cases without evidence of EGFR gene amplification, discriminant analysis based on morphometric variables provided a good separation of these cases from cases with distinct EGFR gene amplification, with a high percentage of statistically correct reclassified cases. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence of a relationship between genetic alterations and histomorphology of glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11332080
"""Use of FDA approved methamphetamine to allow adjunctive use of methylnaltrexone to mediate core anti-growth factor signaling effects in glioblastoma.""","""Methylnaltrexone (MNTX) was recently FDA approved to treat opiate induced constipation. It happens to also indirectly reduce Src activity. Src is a 54 kDa tyrosine kinase, crucial in signaling of, and link between, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Glioblastomas use both EGF and VEGF signaling to enhance growth and neo-angiogenesis. Stem cell sub-fractions of glioblastomas are enriched for high VEGF synthesizing cells so this is a particularly valuable adjunctive target during cytotoxic treatment with drugs like temozolomide. MNTX does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Methamphetamine (MA) temporarily opens the BBB and therefore may allow methylnaltrexone entry into glioblastoma tissue. MA is FDA approved, marketed to treat attention problems in children. MA-MNTX combination should be tested as glioblastoma treatment adjunct. Temozolomide CSF levels are 10-20% of blood levels. Thus MA may also allow greater brain tissue temozolomide levels yet with lower systemic exposure.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19322519
"""Positron emission tomographic evaluations in the diagnosis and therapy of multifocal glioblastoma.

A PET scan employing 15O and 18F positron tracers disclosed a right thalamic lesion high in regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and metabolic glucose rate, suggesting a malignant tumor. In contrast, a left frontal lesion with low regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and metabolic glucose rate was presumed to be rather hypodynamic and hypometabolic. Histological examination of these isolated masses showed both to be glioblastomas, and, as predicted by the PET findings, there were minor histological distinctions. In repeated PET scans following postoperative combined radiochemotherapy, metabolic glucose rate values at the thalamic tumor decreased to about 50% the levels before therapy, although there was no distinguishable change in tumor size on the concurrent computerized tomography scans. This therapeutic efficacy on tumor metabolism was highly consistent with the period of clinical relief.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3039475
"""HIV protease inhibitors decrease VEGF/HIF-1alpha expression and angiogenesis in glioblastoma cells.""","""Glioblastomas are malignant brain tumors that are rarely curable, even with aggressive therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation). Glioblastomas frequently display loss of PTEN and/or epidermal growth factor receptor activation, both of which activate the PI3K pathway. This pathway can increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression. We examined the effects of two human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors, nelfinavir and amprenavir, which inhibit Akt signaling, on VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression and on angiogenesis. Nelfinavir decreased VEGF mRNA expression and VEGF secretion under normoxia. Downregulation of P-Akt decreased VEGF secretion in a manner similar to that of nelfinavir, but the combination of the two had no greater effect, consistent with the idea that nelfinavir decreases VEGF through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Nelfinavir also decreased the hypoxic induction of VEGF and the hypoxic induction of HIF-1alpha, which regulates VEGF promoter. The effect of nelfinavir on HIF-1alpha was most likely mediated by decreased protein translation. Nelfinavir's effect on VEGF expression had the functional consequence of decreasing angiogenesis in in vivo Matrigel plug assays. Similar effects on VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression were seen with a different protease inhibitor, amprenavir. Our results support further research into these protease inhibitors for use in future clinical trials for patients with glioblastoma multiformes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17132220
