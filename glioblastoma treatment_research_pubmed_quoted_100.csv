"""Molecular Mechanisms of Treatment Resistance in Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and is almost invariably fatal. Despite our growing understanding of the various mechanisms underlying treatment failure, the standard-of-care therapy has not changed over the last two decades, signifying a great unmet need. The challenges of treating glioblastoma are many and include inadequate drug or agent delivery across the blood-brain barrier, abundant intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, redundant signaling pathways, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, we review the innate and adaptive molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma's treatment resistance, emphasizing the intrinsic challenges therapeutic interventions must overcome-namely, the blood-brain barrier, tumoral heterogeneity, and microenvironment-and the mechanisms of resistance to conventional treatments, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33396284
"""Revolutionizing Glioblastoma Treatment: A Comprehensive Overview of Modern Therapeutic Approaches.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in the adult population, with an average survival of 12.1 to 14.6 months. The standard treatment, combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, is not as efficient as we would like. However, the current possibilities are no longer limited to the standard therapies due to rapid advancements in biotechnology. New methods enable a more precise approach by targeting individual cells and antigens to overcome cancer. For the treatment of glioblastoma, these are gamma knife therapy, proton beam therapy, tumor-treating fields, EGFR and VEGF inhibitors, multiple RTKs inhibitors, and PI3K pathway inhibitors. In addition, the increasing understanding of the role of the immune system in tumorigenesis and the ability to identify tumor-specific antigens helped to develop immunotherapies targeting GBM and immune cells, including CAR-T, CAR-NK cells, dendritic cells, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Each of the described methods has its advantages and disadvantages and faces problems, such as the inefficient crossing of the blood-brain barrier, various neurological and systemic side effects, and the escape mechanism of the tumor. This work aims to present the current modern treatments of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38891962
"""Recurrent Glioblastoma-Molecular Underpinnings and Evolving Treatment Paradigms.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal central nervous system malignancy with a median survival after progression of only 6-9 months. Major biochemical mechanisms implicated in glioblastoma recurrence include aberrant molecular pathways, a recurrence-inducing tumor microenvironment, and epigenetic modifications. Contemporary standard-of-care (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor treating fields) helps to control the primary tumor but rarely prevents relapse. Cytoreductive treatment such as surgery has shown benefits in recurrent glioblastoma; however, its use remains controversial. Several innovative treatments are emerging for recurrent glioblastoma, including checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, oncolytic virotherapy, nanoparticle delivery, laser interstitial thermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy. This review seeks to provide readers with an overview of (1) recent discoveries in the molecular basis of recurrence; (2) the role of surgery in treating recurrence; and (3) novel treatment paradigms emerging for recurrent glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38928445
"""Glioblastoma multiforme: Pathogenesis and treatment.""","""Each year, about 5-6 cases out of 100,000 people are diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumors, of which about 80% are malignant gliomas (MGs). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) accounts for more than half of MG cases. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite current multimodality treatment efforts including maximal surgical resection if feasible, followed by a combination of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the median survival is short: only about 15months. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors has presented opportunities for newer therapies to evolve and an expectation of better control of this disease. Lately, efforts have been made to investigate tumor resistance, which results from complex alternate signaling pathways, the existence of glioma stem-cells, the influence of the blood-brain barrier as well as the expression of 0(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. In this paper, we review up-to-date information on MGs treatment including current approaches, novel drug-delivering strategies, molecular targeted agents and immunomodulative treatments, and discuss future treatment perspectives.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25944528
"""Glioblastoma and Other Primary Brain Malignancies in Adults: A Review.""","""Importance: Malignant primary brain tumors cause more than 15 000 deaths per year in the United States. The annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals and increases with age. Five-year survival is approximately 36%. Observations: Approximately 49% of malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas, and 30% are diffusely infiltrating lower-grade gliomas. Other malignant brain tumors include primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (7%) and malignant forms of ependymomas (3%) and meningiomas (2%). Symptoms of malignant brain tumors include headache (50%), seizures (20%-50%), neurocognitive impairment (30%-40%), and focal neurologic deficits (10%-40%). Magnetic resonance imaging before and after a gadolinium-based contrast agent is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating brain tumors. Diagnosis requires tumor biopsy with consideration of histopathological and molecular characteristics. Treatment varies by tumor type and often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. For patients with glioblastoma, the combination of temozolomide with radiotherapy improved survival when compared with radiotherapy alone (2-year survival, 27.2% vs 10.9%; 5-year survival, 9.8% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.7]; P < .001). In patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q codeletion, probable 20-year overall survival following radiotherapy without vs with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine was 13.6% vs 37.1% (80 patients; HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.35-1.03]; P = .06) in the EORTC 26951 trial and 14.9% vs 37% in the RTOG 9402 trial (125 patients; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40-0.94]; P = .02). Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma includes high-dose methotrexate-containing regimens, followed by consolidation therapy with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue, nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimens, or whole brain radiation. Conclusions and relevance: The incidence of primary malignant brain tumors is approximately 7 per 100 000 individuals, and approximately 49% of primary malignant brain tumors are glioblastomas. Most patients die from progressive disease. First-line therapy for glioblastoma is surgery followed by radiation and the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809318
"""Medicinal Plants for Glioblastoma Treatment.""","""Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, demonstrates the least life expectancy among all brain cancers. Because of the regulation of diverse signaling pathways in cancers, the chemotherapeutic approaches used to suppress their multiplication and spread are restricted. Sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents has been developed because of the pathological and drug-evading abilities of these diverse mechanisms. As a result, the identification and exploration of strategies or treatments, which can overcome such refractory obstacles to improve glioblastoma response to treatment as well as recovery, is essential. Medicinal herbs contain a wide variety of bioactive compounds, which could trigger aggressive brain cancers, regulate their anti-cancer mechanisms and immune responses to assist in cancer elimination, and cause cell death. Numerous tumor-causing proteins, which facilitate invasion as well as metastasis of cancer, tolerance of chemotherapies, and angiogenesis, are also inhibited by these phytochemicals. Such herbs remain valuable for glioblastoma prevention and its incidence by effectively being used as anti-glioma therapies. This review thus presents the latest findings on medicinal plants using which the extracts or bioactive components are being used against glioblastoma, their mechanism of functioning, pharmacological description, and recent clinical studies conducted on them.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939551
"""Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541850
"""Focused ultrasound for the treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Six years ago, in 2015, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation sponsored a workshop to discuss, and subsequently transition the landscape, of focused ultrasound as a new therapy for treating glioblastoma. Methods: This year, in 2021, a second workshop was held to review progress made in the field. Discussion topics included blood-brain barrier opening, thermal and nonthermal tumor ablation, immunotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, and desired focused ultrasound device improvements. Results: The outcome of the 2021 workshop was the creation of a new roadmap to address knowledge gaps and reduce the time it takes for focused ultrasound to become part of the treatment armamentarium and reach clinical adoption for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma. Priority projects identified in the roadmap include determining a well-defined algorithm to confirm and quantify drug delivery following blood-brain barrier opening, identifying a focused ultrasound-specific microbubble, exploring the role of focused ultrasound for liquid biopsy in glioblastoma, and making device modifications that better support clinical needs. Conclusion: This article reviews the key preclinical and clinical updates from the workshop, outlines next steps to research, and provides relevant references for focused ultrasound in the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35267132
"""Overcoming the blood-brain tumor barrier for effective glioblastoma treatment.""","""Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Particularly in adult patients, the vast majority of gliomas belongs to the heterogeneous group of diffuse gliomas, i.e. glial tumors characterized by diffuse infiltrative growth in the preexistent brain tissue. Unfortunately, glioblastoma, the most aggressive (WHO grade IV) diffuse glioma is also by far the most frequent one. After standard treatment, the 2-year overall survival of glioblastoma patients is approximately only 25%. Advanced knowledge in the molecular pathology underlying malignant transformation has offered new handles and better treatments for several cancer types. Unfortunately, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients have not yet profited as although numerous experimental drugs have been tested in clinical trials, all failed miserably. This grim prognosis for GBM is at least partly due to the lack of successful drug delivery across the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The human brain comprises over 100 billion capillaries with a total length of 400 miles, a total surface area of 20 m(2) and a median inter-capillary distance of about 50 μm, making it the best perfused organ in the body. The BBTB encompasses existing and newly formed blood vessels that contribute to the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor and facilitate glioma cell migration to other parts of the brain. The high metabolic demands of high-grade glioma create hypoxic areas that trigger increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels and a dysfunctional BBTB. Even though the BBTB is considered 'leaky' in the core part of glioblastomas, in large parts of glioblastomas and, even more so, in lower grade diffuse gliomas the BBTB more closely resembles the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents efficient passage of cancer therapeutics, including small molecules and antibodies. Thus, many drugs can still be blocked from reaching the many infiltrative glioblastoma cells that demonstrate 'within-organ-metastasis' away from the core part to brain areas displaying a more organized and less leaky BBTB. Hence, drug delivery in glioblastoma deserves explicit attention as otherwise new experimental therapies will continue to fail. In the current review we highlight different aspects of the BBTB in glioma patients and preclinical models and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of drug delivery approaches for the treatment of glioma patients. We provide an overview on methods to overcome the BBTB, including osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), bradykinin receptor-mediated BBTB opening, inhibition of multidrug efflux transporters, receptor-mediated transport systems and physiological circumvention of the BBTB. While our knowledge about the molecular biology of glioma cells is rapidly expanding and is, to some extent, already assisting us in the design of tumor-tailored therapeutics, we are still struggling to develop modalities to expose the entire tumor to such therapeutics at pharmacologically meaningful quantities. Therefore, we must expand our knowledge about the fundamentals of the BBTB as a step toward the design of practical and safe devices and approaches for enhanced drug delivery into the diseased brain area.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25791797
"""Novel Therapies in Glioblastoma Treatment: Review of Glioblastoma; Current Treatment Options; and Novel Oncolytic Viral Therapies.""","""One of the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors is glioblastoma (GB). About 6 incidents per 100,000 people are reported annually. Most frequently, these tumors are linked to a poor prognosis and poor quality of life. There has been little advancement in the treatment of GB. In recent years, some innovative medicines have been tested for the treatment of newly diagnosed cases of GB and recurrent cases of GB. Surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy are all common treatments for GB. A few of the potential alternatives include immunotherapy, tumor-treating fields (TTFs), and medications that target specific cellular receptors. To provide new multimodal therapies that focus on the molecular pathways implicated in tumor initiation and progression in GB, novel medications, delivery technologies, and immunotherapy approaches are being researched. Of these, oncolytic viruses (OVs) are among the most recent. Coupling OVs with certain modern treatment approaches may have significant benefits for GB patients. Here, we discuss several OVs and how they work in conjunction with other therapies, as well as virotherapy for GB. The study was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Systematic retrieval of information was performed on PubMed. A total of 307 articles were found in a search on oncolytic viral therapies for glioblastoma. Out of these 83 articles were meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, reviews, and systematic reviews. A total of 42 articles were from the years 2018 to 2023. Appropriate studies were isolated, and important information from each of them was understood and entered into a database from which the information was used in this article. One of the most prevalent malignant brain tumors is still GB. Significant promise and opportunity exist for oncolytic viruses in the treatment of GB and in boosting immune response. Making the most of OVs in the treatment of GB requires careful consideration and evaluation of a number of its application factors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38249077
"""A state-of-the-art liposome technology for glioblastoma treatment.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a challenging problem due to the poor BBB permeability of cancer drugs, its recurrence after the treatment, and high malignancy and is difficult to treat with the currently available therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the prognosis and survival rate of GBM are still poor after surgical removal via conventional combination therapy. Owing to the existence of the formidable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the aggressive, infiltrating nature of GBM growth, the diagnosis and treatment of GBM are quite challenging. Recently, liposomes and their derivatives have emerged as super cargos for the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma because of their advantages, such as biocompatibility, long circulation, and ease of physical and chemical modification, which facilitate the capability of targeting specific sites, circumvention of BBB transport restrictions, and amplification of the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we provide a timely update on the burgeoning liposome-based drug delivery systems and potential challenges in these fields for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Furthermore, we focus on the most recent liposome-based drug delivery cargos, including pH-sensitive, temperature-sensitive, and biomimetic liposomes, to enhance the multimodality in imaging and therapeutics of glioblastoma. Furthermore, we highlight the future difficulties and directions for the research and clinical translation of liposome-based drug delivery. Hopefully, this review will trigger the interest of researchers to expedite the development of liposome cargos and even their clinical translation for improving the prognosis of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37937394
"""Glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas: a clinical review.""","""Importance: Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. Objective: To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications. Evidence review: Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system. Findings: Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis. Conclusions and relevance: Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193082
"""Investigational treatment strategies in glioblastoma: progress made and barriers to success.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype (IDHwt), remains an incurable disease despite considerable research effort. The current standard of care since 2005 comprises maximal safe resection followed by radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide; more recently, the addition of tumor treating fields was approved in the newly diagnosed and recurrent disease settings. Areas covered: Searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov provided a foundation for this review. We first describe early research including carmustine wafers, brachytherapy, anti-angiogenesis, and immune checkpoint inhibition for glioblastoma. Next, we discuss challenges precluding the translation of preclinical successes. This is followed by a description of promising treatments such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy as well as the recent qualified successes of cancer vaccinations. Non-immunotherapy trials are also highlighted, and ongoing or pending phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are codified in study tables. Expert opinion: Unfortunately, hundreds of trials, including of agents effective in systemic malignancy, have not drastically changed management of glioblastoma. This may reflect unique resistance mechanisms and highlights a need for multimodality treatments beyond surgery, radiation, and conventional chemotherapy. Novel techniques, such as those in the emerging field of cancer neuroscience, may help uncover tolerable and effective regimens for this lethal malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37796104
"""Recent Developments in Glioblastoma Therapy: Oncolytic Viruses and Emerging Future Strategies.""","""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. Standard treatment protocols and traditional immunotherapy are poorly effective as they do not significantly increase the long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) may be an effective alternative approach. Combining OVs with some modern treatment options may also provide significant benefits for glioblastoma patients. Here we review virotherapy for glioblastomas and describe several OVs and their combination with other therapies. The personalized use of OVs and their combination with other treatment options would become a significant area of research aiming to develop the most effective treatment regimens for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36851761
"""Exosomes: Their role in the diagnosis, progression, metastasis, and treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Exosomes are crucial for the growth and spread of glioblastomas, an aggressive form of brain cancer. These tiny vesicles play a crucial role in the activation of signaling pathways and intercellular communication. They can also transfer a variety of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor to recipient cells. Exosomes can influence the immune response by regulating the activity of immune cells, and they are crucial for the growth and metastasis of glioblastoma cells. In addition, exosomes contribute to drug resistance during treatment, which is a major obstacle in the treatment of glioblastoma. By studying them, the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma can be improved. Due to their high biocompatibility and lack of toxicity, they have become an attractive option for drug delivery. The development of exosomes as carriers of specific therapeutic agents could overcome some of the obstacles to effective treatment of glioblastoma. In this review, we address the potential of exosomes for the treatment of glioblastoma and show how they can be modified for this purpose.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806071
"""Treatment of Glioblastoma in Older Adults.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor diagnosed in the USA and is associated with a poor prognosis. The outcomes in elderly patients (more than 65 years of age) are worse when compared to those younger than age 65 at the time of diagnosis. Older patients are not always offered treatments that would otherwise be considered standard of care due to comorbidities and concerns about toxicity and tolerability. The initial European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study that led to approval of temozolomide in glioblastoma excluded patients more than 70 years of age. This review outlines challenges that arise in the treatment of glioblastoma in the elderly population and discusses results of recent studies that established the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to radiation and surgery. There is evidence that these patients can benefit from a more aggressive and safe resection, from hypofractionated radiation treatments, and from adjuvant temozolomide.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29075865

Immunotherapy, which predominantly focuses on peptide vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and oncolytic virotherapy, have achieved some promising results in both preclinical and clinical trials. The future of immune therapy for GBM requires an integrated effort with rational combinations of vaccine therapy, cell therapy, and radio- and chemotherapy as well as molecule therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33767690
"""A comprehensive profile of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""In spite of relentless efforts to devise new treatment strategies, primary glioblastomas invariably recur as aggressive, therapy-resistant relapses and patients rapidly succumb to these tumors. Many therapeutic agents are first tested in clinical trials involving recurrent glioblastomas. Remarkably, however, fundamental knowledge on the biology of recurrent glioblastoma is just slowly emerging. Here, we review current knowledge on recurrent glioblastoma and ask whether and how therapies change intra-tumor heterogeneity, molecular traits and growth pattern of glioblastoma, and to which extent this information can be exploited for therapeutic decision-making. We conclude that the ability to characterize and predict therapy-induced changes in recurrent glioblastoma will determine, whether, one day, glioblastoma can be contained in a state of chronic disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27041580
"""Glioblastoma stem cells: lessons from the tumor hierarchy in a lethal cancer.""","""Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of all human cancers. Glioblastomas display striking cellular heterogeneity, with stem-like glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex. Although the original identification of GSCs dates back more than a decade, the purification and characterization of GSCs remains challenging. Despite these challenges, the evidence that GSCs play important roles in tumor growth and response to therapy has grown. Like normal stem cells, GSCs are functionally defined and distinguished from their differentiated tumor progeny at core transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulatory levels, suggesting that no single therapeutic modality will be universally effective against a heterogenous GSC population. Glioblastomas induce a systemic immunosuppression with mixed responses to oncoimmunologic modalities, suggesting the potential for augmentation of response with a deeper consideration of GSCs. Unfortunately, the GSC literature has been complicated by frequent use of inferior cell lines and a lack of proper functional analyses. Collectively, glioblastoma offers a reliable cancer to study cancer stem cells to better model the human disease and inform improved biologic understanding and design of novel therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160393

Although traditionally limited to systemic malignancies (melanoma, lung and colon cancer), the field of immunotherapy has recently identified glioblastoma as a potential target for new treatments. Anti-tumor vaccines (dendritic cell/heat shock), checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric T-cell receptors, and virotherapy all have been preliminarily trialed in glioblastoma patients with reasonable success and safety.

Material and methods: The ESTRO Guidelines Committee identified 14 European experts in close interaction with the ESTRO clinical committee and EANO who discussed and analysed the body of evidence concerning contemporary glioblastoma target delineation, then took part in a two-step modified Delphi process to address open questions. Results: Several key issues were identified and are discussed including i) pre-treatment steps and immobilisation, ii) target delineation and the use of standard and novel imaging techniques, and iii) technical aspects of treatment including planning techniques and fractionation. Based on the EORTC recommendation focusing on the resection cavity and residual enhancing regions on T1-sequences with the addition of a reduced 15 mm margin, special situations are presented with corresponding potential adaptations depending on the specific clinical situation. Conclusions: The EORTC consensus recommends a single clinical target volume definition based on postoperative contrast-enhanced T1 abnormalities, using isotropic margins without the need to cone down. A PTV margin based on the individual mask system and IGRT procedures available is advised; this should usually be no greater than 3 mm when using IGRT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059335

Current standard of care includes surgery and chemoradiation. Synthetic pharmacotherapies continue to be explored as potential therapeutic options for glioblastoma patients.Areas covered: This study reviews synthetic pharmacotherapies that are currently under investigation in phase I-III clinical trials. The authors of this study highlight the mechanisms of action of the synthetic pharmacotherapy agents under investigation, outline the available evidence for their utility based on the literature, and summarize the current landscape.Expert opinion: Although warranting further investigation, the studies generally highlighted here have not shown remarkable changes in clinical benefits beyond what has already been established with radiochemotherapy. As we develop more synthetics, we will likely need to combine them with other synthetics to target multiple separate molecular pathways.

"""Relapsed Glioblastoma: Treatment Strategies for Initial and Subsequent Recurrences.""","""At the time of glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence, a sharp analysis of prognostic factors, disease characteristics, response to adjuvant treatment, and clinical conditions should be performed. A prognostic assessment could allow a careful selection between patients that could be proposed to intensified approaches or palliative setting. Participation in clinical trials aims to improve outcome, and should be encouraged due to dismal prognosis of GBM patients after recurrence. Reoperation should be proposed if the tumor is amenable to a complete resection and if prognostic factors suggest that patient could benefit from a second surgery. Second-line chemotherapy should be chosen based on MGMT status, time to disease recurrence, and toxicity profile. If enrollment into a clinical trial is not possible, a nitrosourea-based regimen is the preferred choice, carefully evaluating any previous temozolomide (TMZ)-related toxicity. In MGMT-methylated patients relapsing after TMZ completion, a rechallenge could be proposed. After second progression, the clinical advantage of subsequent lines of chemotherapy still needs to be clarified. However, based on performance status, patients' preference, and disease behavior, a third-line treatment could be considered. Available treatments include nitrosoureas, bevacizumab, or carboplatin plus etoposide. However, more effective therapeutic options are needed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27461038
"""Challenges in the Treatment of Glioblastoma: Multisystem Mechanisms of Therapeutic Resistance.""","""Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal human cancers, with poor survival despite surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Advances in the treatment of this type of brain tumor are limited because of several resistance mechanisms. Such mechanisms involve limited drug entry into the central nervous system compartment by the blood-brain barrier and by actions of the normal brain to counteract tumor-targeting medications. In addition, the vast heterogeneity in glioblastoma contributes to significant therapeutic resistance by preventing adequate control of the entire tumor mass by a single drug and by facilitating escape mechanisms from targeted agents. The stem cell-like characteristics of glioblastoma promote resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy through upregulation of efflux transporters, promotion of glioblastoma stem cell proliferation in neurogenic zones, and immune suppression, respectively. Metabolic cascades in glioblastoma prevent effective treatments through the optimization of glucose use, the use of alternative nutrient precursors for energy production, and the induction of hypoxia to enhance tumor growth. In the era of precision medicine, an assortment of molecular techniques is being developed to target an individual's unique tumor, with the hope that this personalized strategy will bypass therapeutic resistance.

It is notorious for its extremely low (~5%) 5-year survival rate which signals the unsatisfactory results of the standard protocol for GB therapy. This issue has become, over time, the impetus for the discipline of bringing novel therapeutics to the surface and challenging them so they can be improved. The cell-based approach in treating GB found its way to clinical trials thanks to a marvelous number of preclinical studies that probed various types of cells aiming to combat GB and increase the survival rate. In this review, we aimed to summarize and discuss the up-to-date preclinical studies that utilized stem cells or immune cells to treat GB. Likewise, we tried to summarize the most recent clinical trials using both cell categories to treat or prevent recurrence of GB in patients. As with any other therapeutics, cell-based therapy in GB is still hampered by many drawbacks. Therefore, we highlighted several novel techniques, such as the use of biomaterials, scaffolds, nanoparticles, or cells in the 3D context that may depict a promising future when combined with the cell-based approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35011678

Regardless of the problems in clinical development, the rationale for the application of anti-angiogenics in glioblastoma remains.Areas covered: Resistance to anti-angiogenics is discussed, including vessel co-option and amplification of hypoxic signaling in response to vessel destruction. The modulation of GSC and tumor-associated macrophages by dysfunctional tumor vessels and by hypoxia are outlined. Pharmacologic approaches to sensitizing glioblastomas to anti-angiogenics and evidence for the cooperation of anti-angiogenics with immunotherapies are summarized.

The better understanding of vascular co-option and adverse effects of blood vessel destruction guides to improve strategies for vascular targeting. The pivotal role of the vasculature and of angiogenic factors such as VEGF for the induction and maintenance of immunosuppression in glioblastoma supports the use of anti-angiogenics in combination with immunotherapy.

Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) are emerging treatment modalities for glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the methodology and feasibility to combine BNCT and CIRT treatments. The combined treatment plan illustrated how the synergistic utilization of BNCT's biological targeting and CIRT's intensity modulation capabilities could lead to optimized treatment outcomes.Approach. The Monte Carlo toolkit, TOPAS, was employed to calculate the dose distribution for BNCT, while matRad was utilized for the optimization of CIRT. The biological effect-based approach, instead of the dose-based approach, was adopted to develop the combined BNCT-CIRT treatment plans for six patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, considering the different radiosensitivity and fraction. Five optional combined treatment plans with specific BNCT effect proportions for each patient were evaluated to identify the optimal treatment that minimizes damage on normal tissue.Main results. Individual BNCT exhibits a significant effect gradient along with the beam direction in the large tumor, while combined BNCT-CIRT treatments can achieve uniform effect delivery within the clinical target volume (CTV) through the effect filling with reversed gradient by the CIRT part. In addition, the increasing BNCT effect proportion in combined treatments can reduce damage in the normal brain tissue near the CTV. Besides, the combined treatments effectively minimize damage to the skin compared to individual BNCT treatments.Significance. The initial endeavor to combine BNCT and CIRT treatment plans is achieved by the effect-based optimization.

GBM treatment is mainly based on the maximal surgical resection and radiotherapy associated to chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used in chemotherapy protocols for GBM treatment in order to improve immunotherapy and antiangiogenic processes. High specificity and affinity of mAbs for biological targets make them highly used for brain tumor therapy. Specifically, antiangiogenic mAbs have been wisely indicated in chemotherapy protocols because GBM is the most vascularized tumors in humans with high expression of cytokines. However, mAb-based therapy is not that effective due to the aggressive spread of the tumor associated to the difficulty in the access of mAb into the brain (due to the blood-brain barrier). For that reason, nanobiotechnology has played an important role in the treatment of several tumors, mainly in the tumors of difficult access, such as GBM.

Despite aggressive multimodal therapy, consisting mostly of a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy, tumors nearly always recur close to the site of resection. For the past 15 years, very little progress has been made with regards to improving patient survival. Although immunotherapy represents an attractive therapy modality due to the promising pre-clinical results observed, many of these potential immunotherapeutic approaches fail during clinical trials, and to date no immunotherapeutic treatments for GBM have been approved. As for many other difficult to treat cancers, GBM combines a lack of immunogenicity with few mutations and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unfortunately, both tumor and immune cells have been shown to contribute towards this immunosuppressive phenotype. In addition, current therapeutics also exacerbate this immunosuppression which might explain the failure of immunotherapy-based clinical trials in the GBM setting. Understanding how these mechanisms interact with one another, as well as how one can increase the anti-tumor immune response by addressing local immunosuppression will lead to better clinical results for immune-based therapeutics. Improving therapeutic delivery across the blood brain barrier also presents a challenge for immunotherapy and future therapies will need to consider this.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multimodal treatment on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in ML glioblastoma. Methods: Patients presenting with CNS WHO grade 4 glioblastoma with ML to 2 major German Departments of Neurosurgery between January 1st, 2008, to December 31st, 2020 were included in this study. Primary outcome parameters were extent of resection (EOR) using the 2021 RANO criteria, progression free- and overall survival. Results: A total of 483 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (CNS WHO grade 4) were assessed. 134 patients presented with ML (72 multifocal (MF), 62 multicentric (MC)). The median PFS and OS did not differ among MC and MF glioblastomas. The EOR was a significant predictor of PFS and OS in ML glioblastoma. complete-, near total-, and subtotal resection significantly prolonged PFS (p < 0.0001) and OS (p < 0.0001) compared to biopsy alone. Standard radiotherapy (p = 0.045) and hypofractionated (p < 0.0001) radiotherapy and adjuvant treatment (Stupp protocol) prolonged PFS (p = 0.0012) and OS (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis Karnfosky performance score, EOR, and concomitant adjuvant treatment remained significant factors influencing OS. Propensity score matching of patients with ML and solitary lesion tumors showed similar PFS and OS (p = 0.08).

The number of immunotherapy approaches to fight glioblastoma is growing. Here, we review the recent progress in four main areas: dendritic cell immunotherapy, peptide vaccination, chimeric antigen receptors and immune checkpoints. Recent findings: We and others are using dendritic cells to present glioblastoma antigens (whole tumor lysate) to the immune system; our initial data indicate that clinical benefit is associated to increased presence of natural killer cells in the periphery. A pilot study loading dendritic cells with glioblastoma stem-like cells will start soon. Peptide vaccination targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) epitope, present in 25% of glioblastomas, is ongoing. Intriguing results have been obtained by vaccination with three other peptides in pediatric gliomas. Another clinical trial is targeting EGFRvIII by adoptive cell transfer of chimeric antigen receptor. This exciting technology could be suited for a number of other potential epitopes discovered through next-generation sequencing. Finally, antibodies against the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1, which demonstrated efficacy in advanced melanomas, will be used in novel trials for recurrent glioblastoma.

Age and dexamethasone administration in glioblastoma patients have been hypothesized to limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy, but their effects remain unclear. We compared peripheral blood immune composition in patients with different types of brain tumor to determine the influence of age, dexamethasone treatment, and tumor volume. Methods: High-dimensional mass cytometry was used to characterise peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 169 patients with glioblastoma, lower grade astrocytoma, metastases and meningioma. We used blood from medically-refractory epilepsy patients and healthy controls as control groups. Immune phenotyping was performed using FlowSOM and t-SNE analysis in R followed by supervised annotation of the resulting clusters. We conducted multiple linear regression analysis between intracranial pathology and cell type abundance, corrected for clinical variables. We tested correlations between cell type abundance and survival with Cox-regression analyses. Results: Glioblastoma patients had significantly fewer naive CD4+ T cells, but higher percentages of mature NK cells than controls. Decreases of naive CD8+ T cells and alternative monocytes and an increase of memory B cells in glioblastoma patients were influenced by age and dexamethasone treatment, and only memory B cells by tumor volume. Progression free survival was associated with percentages of CD4+ regulatory T cells and double negative T cells. Conclusion: High-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood in patients with different types of intracranial tumor provides insight into the relation between intracranial pathology and peripheral immune status.

A second is to use a radiosensitizer to enhance the radiotherapy effect on CSCs. A third is to use immune cells to attack the CSCs. In a fourth method, an agent is used to promote CSCs to differentiate into normal cells. Finally, ongoing gene therapy may be helpful. New therapeutic agents for targeting a signal pathway, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) or protein kinase inhibitors, have been used for GBM but for CSCs the effects still require further evaluation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitors have proven to be effective for increasing radiation sensitivity of CSCs in culture.

Treatments for glioblastoma are similar to standard therapies for many other cancers and do not effectively prolong the survival of patients, due to the unique location and heterogeneous characteristics of glioblastoma. Immunotherapy has shown a promising effect for many other tumors, but its application for glioma still has some challenges. The recent breakthrough of high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) systems has allowed researchers to update their strategy for identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in a much shorter time with lesser effort. The protein maps can contribute to generating a complete map of regulatory systems to elucidate tumor mechanisms. In particular, newly developed unicellular proteomics could be used to determine the microenvironment and heterogeneity. In addition, a large scale of differentiated proteins provides more ways to precisely classify tumor subtypes and construct a larger library for biomarkers and biotargets, especially for immunotherapy. A series of advanced proteomic studies have been devoted to the different aspects of immunotherapy for glioma, including monoclonal antibodies, oncolytic viruses, dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.

This poor prognosis has lead scientists to seek alternative molecular approaches for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Among these, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, and immunotherapy are all approaches that are currently being investigated. While these molecular approaches may not herald an immediate change in the prognosis of these aggressive tumors, combining them with existing approaches may bring some progress in the standard of care. This paper reviews current treatments and several newer therapies in preclinical and early clinical studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18473496
"""Understanding the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment: leveraging the extracellular matrix to increase immunotherapy efficacy.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) accounts for approximately half of all malignant brain tumors, and it remains lethal with a five-year survival of less than 10%. Despite the immense advancements in the field, it has managed to evade even the most promising therapeutics: immunotherapies. The main reason is the highly spatiotemporally heterogeneous and immunosuppressive GBM tumor microenvironment (TME). Accounting for this complex interplay of TME-driven immunosuppression is key to developing effective therapeutics. This review will explore the immunomodulatory role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by establishing its contribution to the TME as a key mediator of immune responses in GBM. This relationship will help us elucidate therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to develop and deliver more effective immunotherapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38380331
"""Prognostic differences and implications on treatment strategies between butterfly glioblastoma and glioblastoma with unilateral corpus callosum infiltration.""","""Approximately 25% of glioblastomas show at diagnosis a corpus callosum infiltration, which is associated with poor prognosis. The extent of corpus callosum involvement, however, ranges from partial unilateral to complete bilateral infiltration. The role of surgery in glioblastoma with corpus callosum involvement is controversial. In this study, we aimed to examine prognostic differences between glioblastoma with unilateral and glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration, and to evaluate possible treatment strategy implications. Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from 2010 to 2019 were included. Corpus callosum infiltration was assessed in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Extent of resection, adjuvant treatments and overall survival were evaluated. Corpus callosum involvement was found in 96 (26.4%) out of 363 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Bilateral corpus callosum infiltration was found in 27 out of 96 patients (28%), and 69 patients had unilateral corpus callosum infiltration. Glioblastoma with corpus callosum affection had significantly lower median overall survival compared to glioblastoma without corpus callosum involvement (9 vs. 11 months, p = 0.02). A subgroup analysis of glioblastoma with unilateral corpus callosum infiltration revealed a significant difference in median overall survival dependent on extent of resection (6.5 without gross total resection vs. 11 months with gross total resection, Log-rank test p = 0.02). Our data confirms a shorter overall survival in glioblastoma subpopulation with corpus callosum involvement, especially for glioblastoma with bilateral corpus callosum infiltration. However, patients with partial corpus callosum infiltration undergoing gross total resection exhibited a significant survival benefit compared to their counterparts without gross total resection. Whenever reasonably achievable gross total resection should be considered as an integral part of the treatment strategy in glioblastoma with partial corpus callosum infiltration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357498
"""Antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed glioblastoma: analysis of single-agent and combined modality approaches.""","""Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma can prolong survival, but it is not curative. For patients with disease progression after frontline therapy, there is no standard of care, although further surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy may be used. Antiangiogenic therapies may be appropriate for treating glioblastomas because angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth. In a large, noncomparative phase II trial, bevacizumab was evaluated alone and with irinotecan in patients with recurrent glioblastoma; combination treatment was associated with an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 50.3%, a median overall survival of 8.9 months, and a response rate of 37.8%. Single-agent bevacizumab also exceeded the predetermined threshold of activity for salvage chemotherapy (6-month PFS rate, 15%), achieving a 6-month PFS rate of 42.6% (p < 0.0001). On the basis of these results and those from another phase II trial, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of single-agent bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma that has progressed following prior therapy. Potential antiangiogenic agents-such as cilengitide and XL184-also show evidence of single-agent activity in recurrent glioblastoma. Moreover, the use of antiangiogenic agents with radiation at disease progression may improve the therapeutic ratio of single-modality approaches. Overall, these agents appear to be well tolerated, with adverse event profiles similar to those reported in studies of other solid tumors. Further research is needed to determine the role of antiangiogenic therapy in frontline treatment and to identify the optimal schedule and partnering agents for use in combination therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214925

In this review, the authors discuss the unique applications of intraarterial (IA) delivery of OVs, starting with concepts of OV, how they apply to IA delivery, and concluding with discussion of the current ongoing trials. Several OVs have been used in the treatment of GBM, including specifically several modified adenoviruses. IA delivery of OVs has been performed in the hepatic circulation and is now being studied in the cerebral circulation to help enhance delivery and specificity. There are some interesting synergies with immunotherapy and IA delivery of OVs. Some of the shortcomings are discussed, specifically the systemic response to OVs and feasibility of treatment.

"""Comparison of peripheral leukocyte parameters in patients receiving conventionally and hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Treatment for glioblastomas, aggressive and nearly uniformly fatal brain tumors, provide limited long-term success. Immunosuppression by myeloid cells in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation are believed to contribute to this treatment resistance. Standard multi-modality therapy includes conventionally fractionated radiotherapy over 6 weeks; however, hypofractionated radiotherapy over 3 weeks or less may be appropriate for older patients or populations with poor performance status. Lymphocyte concentration changes have been reported in patients with glioblastoma; however, monocytes are likely a key cell type contributing to immunosuppression in glioblastoma. Peripheral monocyte concentration changes in patients receiving commonly employed radiation fractionation schemes are unknown. Methods: To determine the effect of conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated radiotherapy on complete blood cell leukocyte parameters, retrospective longitudinal concentrations were compared prior to, during, and following standard chemoradiation treatment. Results: This study is the first to report increased monocyte concentrations and decreased lymphocyte concentrations in patients treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy compared to hypofractionated radiotherapy. Discussion: Understanding the impact of fractionation on peripheral blood leukocytes is important to inform selection of dose fractionation schemes for patients receiving radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38022656
"""Current Advances in Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose of review: This review seeks to inform oncology clinicians and researchers about the development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of glioblastoma. An enumeration of ongoing and recently completed clinical trials will be discussed with special attention given to current technologies implemented to overcome central nervous system-specific challenges including barriers to the peripheral immune system, impaired antigen presentation, and T cell dysfunction. Recent findings: The success of immunotherapy in other solid cancers has served as a catalyst to explore its application in glioblastoma, which has limited response to other treatments. Recent developments include multi-antigen vaccines that seek to overcome the heterogeneity of glioblastoma, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which could amplify the adaptive immune response and may have promise in combinatorial approaches. Additionally, oncolytic and retroviruses have opened the door to a plethora of combinatorial approaches aiming to leverage their immunogenicity and/or ability to carry therapeutic transgenes. Treatment of glioblastoma remains a serious challenge both with regard to immune-based as well as other therapeutic strategies. The disease has proven to be highly resistant to treatment due to a combination of tumor heterogeneity, adaptive expansion of resistant cellular subclones, evasion of immune surveillance, and manipulation of various signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and immune response. Immunotherapeutics that are efficacious in other cancer types have unfortunately not enjoyed the same success in glioblastoma, illustrating the challenging and complex nature of this disease and demonstrating the need for development of multimodal treatment regimens utilizing the synergistic qualities of immune-mediated therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33496872

Gliadel) is a polymer wafer containing carmustine. These wafers are designed to be placed in the surgical cavity after glioblastoma resection to deliver local chemotherapy. This treatment is intended for tumors for which gross total resection is possible. Temozolomide is administered concomitantly with radiotherapy for six weeks followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (EORTC 26981, also known as 'Stupp's protocol'). Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. The two-year survival rate was 26.5% with radiotherapy plus temozolomide compared with 10.4% with radiotherapy alone. In patients with complete resection, two-year survival reached 38%.

"""Transferrin-Targeted Liposomes in Glioblastoma Therapy: A Review.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, and its treatment is further complicated by the high selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The scientific community is urgently seeking innovative and effective therapeutic solutions. Liposomes are a promising new tool that has shown potential in addressing the limitations of chemotherapy, such as poor bioavailability and toxicity to healthy cells. However, passive targeting strategies based solely on the physicochemical properties of liposomes have proven ineffective due to a lack of tissue specificity. Accordingly, the upregulation of transferrin receptors (TfRs) in brain tissue has led to the development of TfR-targeted anticancer therapeutics. Currently, one of the most widely adopted methods for improving drug delivery in the treatment of GBM and other neurological disorders is the utilization of active targeting strategies that specifically target this receptor. In this review, we discuss the role of Tf-conjugated liposomes in GBM therapy and present some recent studies investigating the drug delivery efficiency of Tf-liposomes; in addition, we address some challenges currently facing this approach to treatment and present some potential improvement possibilities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37686065
"""Viral Control of Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a universally lethal cancer of the central nervous system. Patients with GBM have a median survival of 14 months and a 5-year survival of less than 5%, a grim statistic that has remained unchanged over the last 50 years. GBM is intransigent for a variety of reasons. The immune system has a difficult time mounting a response against glioblastomas because they reside in the brain (an immunologically dampened compartment) and generate few neoantigens relative to other cancers. Glioblastomas inhabit the brain like sand in the grass and display a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, impeding efforts to therapeutically target a single pathway. Of all potential therapeutic strategies to date, virotherapy offers the greatest chance of counteracting each of the obstacles mounted by GBM. Virotherapy can xenogenize a tumor that is deft at behaving like 'self', triggering adaptive immune recognition in an otherwise immunologically quiet compartment. Viruses can also directly lyse tumor cells, creating damage and further stimulating secondary immune reactions that are detrimental to tumor growth. In this review, we summarize the basic immune mechanisms underpinning GBM immune evasion and the recent successes achieved using virotherapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34209584

Unfortunately, increasing age is one of the most important negative prognostic factors in gliomas. However, the previous nihilistic approach is progressively changing towards more active strategies. Particularly, prospective randomized studies have recently established the benefit of radiotherapy associated with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy by temozolomide in older patients with good functional status suffering from malignant gliomas. Chemotherapy alone may even be useful in this population, especially in patients with poor functional status. Symptomatic treatments such as corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs may be less tolerated in this population compared to younger patients and should be used only if needed. Initial performance status, quality of life and concomitant pathologies are obviously important factors to consider before treatment onset. The willingness of the patient and his caregivers will also be the key of the therapeutic decision. In the future, it will be necessary to develop specific schedules of treatment in this population.

This review summarizes the current status of precision oncology in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults with a median survival below 2 years. Targeted treatments without prior target verification have consistently failed. Patients with BRAF V600E-mutated GBM benefit from BRAF/MEK-inhibition, whereas targeting EGFR alterations was unsuccessful due to poor tumor penetration, tumor cell heterogeneity, and pathway redundancies. Systematic screening for actionable molecular alterations resulted in low rates (< 10%) of targeted treatments. Efficacy was observed in one-third and currently appears to be limited to BRAF-, VEGFR-, and mTOR-directed treatments. Advancing precision oncology for GBM requires consideration of pathways instead of single alterations, new trial concepts enabling rapid and adaptive drug evaluation, a focus on drugs with sufficient bioavailability in the CNS, and the extension of target discovery and validation to the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell networks, and their interaction with immune cells and neurons.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38899374
"""Glioblastoma: changing expectations?""","""Glioblastoma (GB) represents the most aggressive glioma in the adult population. Despite recent research efforts, the prognosis of patients with GB has remained dismal. Lately, the knowledge of genetic information about gliomagenesis has increased; we even have a classification of the genetic expression of the tumour. The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new expectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival.

In general, glioblastomas with a subclass transition showed upregulated metabolic processes. Newly diagnosed glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition displayed increased stem cell-like states and decreased immune components at diagnosis and exhibited elevated immune signatures and cytokine levels in serum. In contrast, tissue of recurrent glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition showed increased immune components but decreased stem cell-like states. Survival analyses revealed comparable outcomes for patients with and without subclass transitions.

The MGMT promoter methylation status allows for a stratification of treatment beyond the surgical intervention. In patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors, monotherapy with temozolomide is superior to radiotherapy alone. Similarly, the benefit conferred by combined temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone is largely restricted to patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumors. At recurrence, no standard treatment has been established. The prognosis for elderly patients with glioblastoma remains poor. The MGMT promoter methylation status helps guiding treatment decisions and withholding inactive, but potentially harmful treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324304
"""[(89)Zr]-CD8 ImmunoPET imaging of glioblastoma multiforme response to combination oncolytic viral and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy reveals CD8 infiltration differential changes in preclinical models.""","""Rationale: Novel immune-activating therapeutics for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have shown potential for tumor regression and increased survival over standard therapies. However, immunotherapy efficacy remains inconsistent with response assessment being complicated by early treatment-induced apparent radiological tumor progression and slow downstream effects. This inability to determine early immunotherapeutic benefit results in a drastically decreased window for alternative, and potentially more effective, treatment options. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of combination immunotherapy on early CD8+ cell infiltration and its association with long term response in orthotopic syngeneic glioblastoma models. Methods: Luciferase positive GBM orthotopic mouse models (GSC005-luc) were imaged via [89Zr]-CD8 positron emission tomography (PET) one week following treatment with saline, anti-PD1, M002 oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) or combination immunotherapy. Subsequently, brains were excised, imaged via [89Zr]-CD8 ImmunoPET and evaluated though autoradiography and histology for H&E and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Longitudinal immunotherapeutic effects were evaluated through [89Zr]-CD8 PET imaging one- and three-weeks following treatment, with changes in tumor volume monitored on a three-day basis via bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Response classification was then performed based on long-term BLI signal changes. Statistical analysis was performed between groups using one-way ANOVA and two-sided unpaired T-test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Correlations between imaging and biological validation were assessed via Pearson's correlation test. Results: [89Zr]-CD8 PET standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification was correlated with ex vivo SUV quantification (r = 0.61, p < 0.01), autoradiography (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), and IHC tumor CD8+ cell density (r = 0.55, p < 0.01). Classification of therapeutic responders, via bioluminescence signal, revealed a more homogeneous CD8+ immune cell distribution in responders (p < 0.05) one-week following immunotherapy. Conclusions: Assessment of early CD8+ cell infiltration and distribution in the tumor microenvironment provides potential imaging metrics for the characterization of oHSV and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy response in GBM. The combination therapies showed enhanced efficacy compared to single agent immunotherapies. Further development of immune-focused imaging methods can provide clinically relevant metrics associated with immune cell localization that can inform immunotherapeutic efficacy and subsequent treatment response in GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38250045

Immunotherapies, including vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T cell therapy, represent promising avenues for GBM treatment. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive TME, and BBB restrictiveness hinder their effectiveness. Strategies to address these challenges, including combination therapies and targeting hypoxia, are actively being explored to improve outcomes for GBM patients.

"""Targeted drug delivery for treatment and imaging of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a grade IV astrocytic tumor with a very high mortality rate. Although current treatment often includes surgical resection, this rarely removes all primary tumor cells, so is usually followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Remaining migratory tumor cells invade surrounding healthy tissue and contribute to secondary and tertiary tumor recurrence; therefore, despite significant research into glioma removal and treatment, prognosis remains poor. A variety of treatment modalities have been investigated to deliver drug to these cells, including systemic, diffusive and convection-enhanced delivery (CED). As systemic delivery is limited by molecules larger than approximately 500 Da being unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), therapeutic concentrations are difficult to attain; thus, localized delivery options relying on diffusion and CED have been used to circumvent the BBB. Although CED enables delivery to a greater volume of tissue than diffusive delivery alone, limitations still exist, requiring that these delivery strategies be improved. This review enumerates the strengths and weaknesses of these currently used strategies and details how predictive mathematical modeling can be used to aid investigators in optimizing these delivery modalities for clinical application.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19538036

Treatments for GB include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. GB is an incurable fatal disease, necessitating the development of innovative strategies to find a developing effective therapy. Genetic therapies may be crucial in treating GB by identifying the mutations and amplifications of multiple genes, which drive its proliferation and spread. Use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) provides a novel technology used to suppress the genes associated with disease, which forms a basis for targeted therapy in GB and its stem cell population, which are recognized for their ability to develop resistance to chemotherapy and tumorigenic capabilities. This review examines the use of siRNAs in GB, emphasizing their effectiveness in suppressing key oncogenes and signaling pathways associated with tumor development, invasion, stemness, and resistance to standard treatments. siRNA-based gene silencing is a promising approach for developing targeted therapeutics against GB and associated stem cell populations, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates in this devastating disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39537100

We hypothesized that next-generation sequencing can be used to guide treatment recommendations within a clinically acceptable time frame following surgery for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.Experimental Design: We conducted a prospective genomics-informed feasibility trial in adults with recurrent and progressive glioblastoma. Following surgical resection, genome-wide tumor/normal exome sequencing and tumor RNA sequencing were performed to identify molecular targets for potential matched therapy. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board issued treatment recommendations based on the genomic results, blood-brain barrier penetration of the indicated therapies, drug-drug interactions, and drug safety profiles. Feasibility of generating genomics-informed treatment recommendations within 35 days of surgery was assessed.Results: Of the 20 patients enrolled in the study, 16 patients had sufficient tumor tissue for analysis. Exome sequencing was completed for all patients, and RNA sequencing was completed for 14 patients. Treatment recommendations were provided within the study's feasibility time frame for 15 of 16 (94%) patients. Seven patients received treatment based on the tumor board recommendations.

"""Galectins as Emerging Glyco-Checkpoints and Therapeutic Targets in Glioblastoma.""","""Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive brain tumor in the adult population, urging identification of new rational therapeutic targets. Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, are highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and delineate prognosis and clinical outcome in patients with GBM. These endogenous lectins play key roles in different hallmarks of cancer by modulating tumor cell proliferation, oncogenic signaling, migration, vascularization and immunity. Additionally, they have emerged as mediators of resistance to different anticancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapy. Particularly in GBM, galectins control tumor cell transformation and proliferation, reprogram tumor cell migration and invasion, promote vascularization, modulate cell death pathways, and shape the tumor-immune landscape by targeting myeloid, natural killer (NK), and CD8+ T cell compartments. Here, we discuss the role of galectins, particularly galectin-1, -3, -8, and -9, as emerging glyco-checkpoints that control different mechanisms associated with GBM progression, and discuss possible therapeutic opportunities based on inhibition of galectin-driven circuits, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008740

These aggressive tumours are characterised by inherent treatment resistance and disease progression, contributing to ~ 190 000 brain tumour-related deaths globally each year. Current therapeutic interventions consist of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, but average survival is typically around 1 year, with < 10% of patients surviving more than 5 years. Recently, a fourth treatment modality of intermediate-frequency low-intensity electric fields [called tumour-treating fields (TTFields)] was clinically approved for glioblastoma in some countries after it was found to increase median overall survival rates by ~ 5 months in a phase III randomised clinical trial. However, beyond these treatments, attempts to establish more effective therapies have yielded little improvement in survival for patients over the last 50 years. This is in contrast to many other types of cancer and highlights glioblastoma as a recognised tumour of unmet clinical need. Previous work has revealed that glioblastomas contain stem cell-like subpopulations that exhibit heightened expression of DNA damage response (DDR) factors, contributing to therapy resistance and disease relapse. Given that radiotherapy, chemotherapy and TTFields-based therapies all impact DDR mechanisms, this Review will focus on our current knowledge of the role of the DDR in glioblastoma biology and treatment.

Objective: To evaluate the results of radiosurgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and to identify the factors determining its effectiveness. Material and methods: Radiosurgery has been carried out in 168 patients with relapses of glioblastoma between 2005 and 2021. This study enrolled 88 patients with 180 foci of local and distant progression. Mean age of patients was 42.8±2.1 years (range 4-73). Mean period between diagnosis and repeated irradiation was 12.7 months. Mean volume of focus was 2.4 cm3, mean dose - 20 Gy. Median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 11.2 months. Results: Repeated irradiation with correction of systemic therapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival with insignificant radiation-induced toxicity. Annual overall survival was 62.2%, median of overall survival after radiosurgery - 15.1 months. Significant factors of local control were marginal dose of at least 18 Gy and distant relapse.

Targeted or tailored therapies for specific mutations or subtypes largely failed due to the complexities arising from intratumoral molecular heterogeneity. Most tumors develop resistance to treatment and soon recur. GBM stem cells (GSCs) have been identified.

Promoter methylation of the O-methylguanine methyltransferase gene seems to predict benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy. Hence, it is used as an entry criterion for alkylator-free experimental combination therapy with radiotherapy. Screening for a specific type of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is currently being explored as a biomarker for selecting patients for vaccination. Positron emission tomography for the detection of ανβ3/5 integrins could be used to select patients for treatment with anti-integrin antiangiogenic approaches. Discussion: Despite extensive efforts at defining biological markers as a basis for selecting therapies, most treatment decisions for glioblastoma patients are still based on age and performance status. However, several ongoing clinical trials may enrich the repertoire of criteria for clinical decision making in the very near future. The concept of individualized or personalized targeted cancer therapy has gained significant attention throughout oncology. Yet, data in support of such an approach to glioblastoma, the most malignant subtype of glioma, are limited, and personalized medicine plays a minor role in current clinical neuro-oncology practice. In essence, this concept proposes that tumors that are currently lumped together based on common morphologic features can be subclassified in a way that the resulting subentities are more homogeneous, for example, in molecular signatures and will therefore be amenable to selective therapeutic interventions. At present, the major 'biomarkers' used to allocate treatment in glioblastoma are age and Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and these markers have so far survived all efforts at more sophisticated approaches to the management of this disease. Treatment allocation basically means intensity of treatment, especially the use of the standard-of-care or radiotherapy alone beyond age 65 to 70 years or below a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of 60.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290256
"""A Conceptual Framework for Inducing T Cell-Mediated Immunity Against Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. Several major challenges have limited the development of novel therapeutics, including the extensive heterogeneity of tumor cell states within each glioblastoma and the ability of glioma cells to diffusely infiltrate into neighboring healthy brain tissue, including the contralateral hemisphere. A T cell-mediated immune response could deal with these challenges based on the ability of polyclonal T cell populations to recognize diverse tumor antigens and perform surveillance throughout tissues. Here we will discuss the major pathways that inhibit T cell-mediated immunity against glioblastoma, with an emphasis on receptor-ligand systems by which glioma cells and recruited myeloid cells inhibit T cell function. A related challenge is that glioblastomas tend to be poorly infiltrated by T cells, which is not only caused by inhibitory molecular pathways but also currently utilized drugs, in particular high-dose corticosteroids that kill activated, proliferating T cells. We will discuss innovative approaches to induce glioblastoma-directed T cell responses, including neoantigen-based vaccines and sophisticated CAR T cell approaches that can target heterogeneous glioblastoma cell populations. Finally, we will propose a conceptual framework for the future development of T cell-based immunotherapies for glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35505129
"""Feasibility of Targeting Glioblastoma Stem Cells: From Concept to Clinical Trials.""","""Objective: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and invasive brain and Central Nervous System (CNS) tumor. Current treatment options do not prolong overall survival significantly because the disease is highly prone to relapse. Therefore, research to find new therapies is of paramount importance. It has been discovered that glioblastomas contain a population of cells with stem-like properties and that these cells are may be responsible for tumor recurrence. Methods: A review of relevant papers and clinical trials in the field was conducted. A PubMed search with related keywords was used to gather the data. For example, 'glioblastoma stem cells AND WNT signaling' is an example used to find information on clinical trials using the database ClinicalTrials.gov. Results: Cancer stem cell research has several fundamental issues and uncertainties that should be taken into consideration. Theoretically, a number of treatment options that target glioblastoma stem cells are available for patients. However, only a few of them have obtained promising results in clinical trials. Several strategies are still under investigation. Conclusion: The majority of treatments to target cancer stem cells have failed during clinical trials. Taking into account a number of biases in the field and the number of unsuccessful investigations, the application of the cancer stem cells concept is questionable in clinical settings, at least with respect to glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31721715
"""How We Treat Recurrent Glioblastoma Today and Current Evidence.""","""Purpose of review: Recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) has no standard treatment. Despite a better molecular knowledge, few therapies have brought changes in clinical practice so far. Here we will review the current data evaluating the re-radiation, re-resection, bevacizumab, and cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in this setting. We will also discuss the advances of immunotherapy and the possible benefit of this treatment for patients with rGBM. Recent findings: Next-generation sequencing is increasingly utilized in the clinical practice of neuro-oncologists, bringing gene mutations as targets for therapies. As in other solid tumors, immunotherapy has been also extensively studied in rGBM, with interesting results in phase I and II trials. The most promising therapies in the horizon are combinations including immune checkpoint inhibitors, virotherapy, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. Although re-radiation, re-resection, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy are still the most widely used therapies for treating rGBM, the clinical benefit from these treatments is still not well established. Preliminary results of studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors were disappointing, but virotherapy emerges as more promising immunotherapy in rGBM, especially in combination with other strategies.

"""Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma: Current Strategies and Challenges in Tumor Model Development.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common brain malignant tumor in the adult population, and immunotherapy is playing an increasingly central role in the treatment of many cancers. Nevertheless, the search for effective immunotherapeutic approaches for glioblastoma patients continues. The goal of immunotherapy is to promote tumor eradication, boost the patient's innate and adaptive immune responses, and overcome tumor immune resistance. A range of new, promising immunotherapeutic strategies has been applied for glioblastoma, including vaccines, oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive cell transfer. However, the main challenges of immunotherapy for glioblastoma are the intracranial location and heterogeneity of the tumor as well as the unique, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Owing to the lack of appropriate tumor models, there are discrepancies in the efficiency of various immunotherapeutic strategies between preclinical studies (with in vitro and animal models) on the one hand and clinical studies (on humans) on the other hand. In this review, we summarize the glioblastoma characteristics that drive tolerance to immunotherapy, the currently used immunotherapeutic approaches against glioblastoma, and the most suitable tumor models to mimic conditions in glioblastoma patients. These models are improving and can more precisely predict patients' responses to immunotherapeutic treatments, either alone or in combination with standard treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572835

"""Immunologic aspects of viral therapy for glioblastoma and implications for interactions with immunotherapies.""","""Introduction: The treatment for glioblastoma (GBM) has remained unchanged for the past decade, with only minimal improvements in patient survival. As a result, novel treatments are needed to combat this devastating disease. Immunotherapies are treatments that stimulate the immune system to attack tumor cells and can be either local or systemically delivered. Viral treatments can lead to direct tumor cell death through their natural lifecycle or through the delivery of a suicide gene, with the potential to generate an anti-tumor immune response, making them interesting candidates for combinatorial treatment with immunotherapy. Methods: We review the current literature surrounding the interactions between oncolytic viruses and the immune system as well as the use of oncolytic viruses combined with immunotherapies for the treatment of GBM. Results: Viral therapies have exhibited preclinical efficacy as single-agents and are being investigated in that manner in clinical trials. Oncolytic viruses have significant interactions with the immune system, although this can also vary depending on the strain of virus. Combinatorial treatments using both oncolytic viruses and immunotherapies have demonstrated promising preclinical findings. Conclusions: Studies combining viral and immunotherapeutic treatment modalities have provided exciting results thus far and hold great promise for patients with GBM. Additional studies assessing the clinical efficacy of these treatments as well as improved preclinical modeling systems, safety mechanisms, and the balance between treatment efficacy and immune-mediated viral clearance should be considered.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33389564
"""Glioblastoma vs temozolomide: can the red queen race be won?""","""Glioblastoma is the most invasive form of brain tumor. Although temozolomide chemotherapy has been shown to significantly improve survival in patients with GBM, this increase is only trivial. The underlying cause is that many GBMs do not respond to temozolomide, and the rest produces resistance. In the past two decades, many attempts have been made to understand resistance mechanisms and to combine other treatments with temozolomide to maximize patient benefit. Unfortunately, it seems to be a red queen game, and the speed of disease development is as fast as the progress in the field. In order to win this game, a comprehensive approach is needed to decipher the details of the resistance mechanism and to transfer the basic research to the clinic.

Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM.

"""Epigenetic remodeling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in human glioblastoma: pre-clinical evidence for development of new immunotherapy approaches.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor, that is refractory to standard treatment and to immunotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Noteworthy, melanoma brain metastases (MM-BM), that share the same niche as GBM, frequently respond to current ICI therapies. Epigenetic modifications regulate GBM cellular proliferation, invasion, and prognosis and may negatively regulate the cross-talk between malignant cells and immune cells in the tumor milieu, likely contributing to limit the efficacy of ICI therapy of GBM. Thus, manipulating the tumor epigenome can be considered a therapeutic opportunity in GBM. Methods: Microarray transcriptional and methylation profiles, followed by gene set enrichment and IPA analyses, were performed to study the differences in the constitutive expression profiles of GBM vs MM-BM cells, compared to the extracranial MM cells and to investigate the modulatory effects of the DNA hypomethylating agent (DHA) guadecitabine among the different tumor cells. The prognostic relevance of DHA-modulated genes was tested by Cox analysis in a TCGA GBM patients' cohort. Results: The most striking differences between GBM and MM-BM cells were found to be the enrichment of biological processes associated with tumor growth, invasion, and extravasation with the inhibition of MHC class II antigen processing/presentation in GBM cells. Treatment with guadecitabine reduced these biological differences, shaping GBM cells towards a more immunogenic phenotype. Indeed, in GBM cells, promoter hypomethylation by guadecitabine led to the up-regulation of genes mainly associated with activation, proliferation, and migration of T and B cells and with MHC class II antigen processing/presentation. Among DHA-modulated genes in GBM, 7.6% showed a significant prognostic relevance. Moreover, a large set of immune-related upstream-regulators (URs) were commonly modulated by DHA in GBM, MM-BM, and MM cells: DHA-activated URs enriched for biological processes mainly involved in the regulation of cytokines and chemokines production, inflammatory response, and in Type I/II/III IFN-mediated signaling; conversely, DHA-inhibited URs were involved in metabolic and proliferative pathways. Conclusions: Epigenetic remodeling by guadecitabine represents a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy of GBM, supporting the rationale to develop new epigenetic-based immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of this still highly deadly disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38429759

EVs are classified into microvacuoles, apoptotic bodies, and exosomes. Exosomes are the most highlighted domains in cancer research. GBM cell-derived exosomes participate in multiple cancer progression events such as immune suppression, angiogenesis, premetastatic niche formation (PMN), ECM (extracellular matrix), EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), metastasis, cancer stem cell development and therapeutic and drug resistance. GBM exosomes also carry the signature of a glioblastoma-related status. The exosome-based GBM examination is part of the new generation of liquid biopsy.

"""Viral-Porphyrin Combo: Photodynamic and Oncolytic Viral Therapy for Potent Glioblastoma Treatment.""","""Combined viral and photodynamic therapy for oncological diseases has great potential to treat aggressive tumors such as glioblastomas. A conjugate of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with protoporphyrin IX was prepared, and its oncolytic effects were studied and compared to the effects of the individual components. The VSV showed an oncolytic effect on glioblastoma cell lines T98G and LN229 at a virus titer of 105 TCID50/mL. A VSV titer of 104 TCID50/mL was sufficient for neuroblastoma cell death. A study of the effect of VSV in tumor 3D cell modeling found that VSV had a clear viral cytopathic effect on spheroids of T98G and LN229 cells. Conjugation with the porphyrin significantly reduced the viral titer, but when irradiated, lysis of cells was observed. Photodynamic treatment of T98G and LN229 cells and spheroids with protoporphyrin IX as a photosensitizer also had a cytotoxic effect on cells and, to a lesser extent, on the tumoroids, as complete cell death was not achieved for the tumoroids. The combination therapy, which involved sequential photodynamic therapy using protoporphyrin IX as a photosensitizer and treatment with VSV, was shown to significantly enhance efficacy, resulting in complete cell death of both T98G and LN229 cells and tumoroids. The combination treatment allowed for the use of a lower viral titer (103-104 TCID50/mL) and a lower porphyrin concentration (0.5 μg/mL) to achieve a significant cytotoxic effect. As a result, the implementation of this combination therapy would likely lead to fewer side effects from the treatment.

We hypothesize that anatomical changes during irradiation may affect the dose coverage of this subvolume for both proton- and photon-based radiotherapy. Material and methods: For 24 glioblastoma patients a photon- and proton-based dose escalation treatment plan (of 75 Gy/30 fr) was simulated on the dedicated radiotherapy planning MRI obtained before treatment. The escalated dose was planned to cover the resection cavity and/or contrast enhancing lesion on the T1w post-gadolinium MRI sequence. To analyze the effect of anatomical changes during treatment, we evaluated on an additional MRI that was obtained during treatment the changes of the dose distribution on this specific high dose region. Results: The median time between the planning MRI and additional MRI was 26 days (range 16-37 days). The median time between the planning MRI and start of radiotherapy was relatively short (7 days, range 3-11 days). In 3 patients (12.5%) changes were observed which resulted in a substantial deterioration of both the photon and proton treatment plans. All these patients underwent a subtotal resection, and a decrease in dose coverage of more than 5% and 10% was observed for the photon- and proton-based treatment plans, respectively. Conclusion: Our study showed that only for a limited number of patients anatomical changes during photon or proton based radiotherapy resulted in a potentially clinically relevant underdosage in the subvolume.

Therefore, extensive surgical resection, when feasible, will remain part of the equation to provide an environment in which active specific immunotherapy has the greatest chance of working. Toward that end, a number of vaccination protocols are under investigation. Vaccines studied to date have produced cellular and humoral antitumor responses, but unequivocal clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated.

Different genes have been studied including suicide genes, which convert non-toxic prodrug into cytotoxic drug; immunomodulatory genes, which stimulate the immune system; and tumor suppressor genes which repair the defect that allow cells to divide unchecked. Gene therapy may be a promising treatment strategy in neuro-oncology as it is versatile and flexible due to the ability to tailor vectors and genes for specific therapeutic activity. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated feasibility and safety of gene therapy; however, further studies are required to determine efficacy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28866732
"""Current therapeutic options for glioblastoma and future perspectives.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma is a malignant primary brain tumor that affects approximately 250,000 new patients per year worldwide. It is among the most difficult cancers to treat, and 5-year survival rates remain low. Standard therapies for glioblastoma include surgical resection, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. Areas covered: We conducted a search of the literature on therapeutic options for glioblastoma on Pubmed. We also searched abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Society for Neuro-Oncology, European Association of Neuro-Oncology and American Association for Cancer Research. We also searched the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials database. We discuss therapeutic options for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, mainly temozolomide, lomustine and tumor treating fields (TTF). Lastly, we discuss therapeutics for recurrent glioblastomas and agents under investigation in clinical trials. Expert opinion: Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged for both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients. The standard post-operative treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients is a combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide. TTF devices can be used in conjunction with temozolomide. Available standard therapies for recurrent glioblastoma include nitrosureas, bevacizumab and temozolomide rechallenge, as well as TTF devices. Agents that are being evaluated in clinical trials include novel targeted therapies, novel chemotherapies, and immunotherapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36100970
"""Current Approaches and Challenges in the Molecular Therapeutic Targeting of Glioblastoma.""","""Surgical resection continues to predominate as the primary treatment modality in glioblastoma (GBM). Effective chemotherapeutic/biologic agents capable of targeting GBM have yet to be developed in part because of the exceptionally heterogeneous nature and unique microenvironmental conditions associated with this malignant neoplasm. Temozolomide and bevacizumab represent the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for primary and recurrent GBM, respectively. Given the high therapeutic resistance of GBM to current therapies, as well as the failure of bevacizumab to prolong overall survival, new therapeutic agents are urgently warranted and are now in the preclinical and clinical phases of development. Accordingly, clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, virotherapies, and tumor vaccination therapy are all under way in GBM. Herein, we review the application of current/novel therapeutics in GBM and in so doing attempt to highlight the most promising solutions to overcome current failures.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152883
"""Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy targeting EGFR-Shedding new light on glioblastoma treatment.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are high-grade brain tumors, differentially driven by alterations (amplification, deletion or missense mutations) in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), that carry a poor prognosis of just 12-15 months following standard therapy. A combination of interventions targeting tumor-specific cell surface regulators along with convergent downstream signaling pathways may enhance treatment efficacy. Against this background, we investigated a novel photoimmunotherapy approach combining the cytotoxicity of photodynamic therapy with the specificity of immunotherapy. An EGFR-specific affibody (ZEGFR:03115 ) was conjugated to the phthalocyanine dye, IR700DX, which when excited with near-infrared light produces a cytotoxic response. ZEGFR:03115 -IR700DX EGFR-specific binding was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The conjugate showed effective targeting of EGFR positive GBM cells in the brain. The therapeutic potential of the conjugate was assessed both in vitro, in GBM cell lines and spheroids by the CellTiter-Glo® assay, and in vivo using subcutaneous U87-MGvIII xenografts. In addition, mice were imaged pre- and post-PIT using the IVIS/Spectrum/CT to monitor treatment response. Binding of the conjugate correlated to the level of EGFR expression in GBM cell lines. The cell proliferation assay revealed a receptor-dependent response between the tested cell lines. Inhibition of EGFRvIII+ve tumor growth was observed following administration of the immunoconjugate and irradiation. Importantly, this response was not seen in control tumors. In conclusion, the ZEGFR:03115 -IR700DX showed specific uptake in vitro and enabled imaging of EGFR expression in the orthotopic brain tumor model. Moreover, the proof-of-concept in vivo PIT study demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of the conjugate in subcutaneous glioma xenografts.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29313975
"""Viral vector: potential therapeutic for glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant primary brain tumour found in adults and is highlighted as the most devastating among all the other grades of glioma. Well-established standard treatment methods, such as chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, have resulted in modest improvement in the survival of patients. Hence, the arduous search for novel treatments backed by advancements in molecular biology still persists. Glioblastoma has many distinctive characteristics, which makes it a potential candidate for gene therapy. Gene therapy involves the delivery of genetic material of therapeutic use into tumour cells, which produces a specific antitumour response. Moreover, viruses stimulate a vigorous cytotoxic effect, they are easily modifiable and the inherent property of horizontal transfer of genetic material makes them valuable tools for genetic engineering.

In the patient, TTFields are delivered as regional treatment via two pairs of orthogonally positioned transducer arrays applied to the head or elsewhere on the body surface. Side effects are primarily localized to the skin. Since the initial proof-of-concept study published in 2007, the use of TTFields has become integrated into the standard-of-care multi-modality treatment of glioblastoma (GBM).

"""Auger electron therapy of glioblastoma using [(125)I]5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and concomitant chemotherapy - Evaluation of a potential treatment strategy.""","""Introduction: Treatment of glioblastomas (GBM) using the Auger electron emitting compound [125I]5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ([125I]I-UdR), combined with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor methotrexate (MTX) and concomitant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has recently shown very promising therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo in animals. The aim of the current study was to investigate if the therapeutic effects of this multimodal treatment strategy could be further increased by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (F-UdR), in comparison to MTX, and if the co-treatment should be given in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Methods: A patient-derived GBM cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched cell line, grown as neurospheres, was employed to evaluate DNA-incorporation of [125I]I-UdR, determined by a DNA precipitation assay, using either pre-treatment or co-treatment with MTX or F-UdR. The therapeutic effects in the CSC-enriched cell line after exposure to various combinations of MTX, F-UdR, TMZ and [125I]I-UdR were also investigated by a CellTiter-Blue assay. Results: The highest general increase in [125I]I-UdR incorporation was observed with F-UdR co-treatment, which resulted in approx. 2.5-fold increase in the DNA-associated activity. Also the cell viability was significantly decreased when F-UdR was combined with [125I]I-UdR compared to [125I]I-UdR alone at all activity concentrations tested. MTX was redundant when combined with 400 and 500 Bq/ml [125I]I-UdR. TMZ was effective in combination with either [125I]I-UdR alone or with both thymidylate synthase inhibitors combined with 50-100 Bq/ml [125I]I-UdR. Conclusions: Overall, our study revealed a higher incorporation and therapeutic effect of [125I]I-UdR when GBM cells were co-treated with F-UdR compared to MTX. The therapeutic effects were further increased when TMZ was combined with [125I]I-UdR in combination with the thymidylate synthase inhibitors.

"""Nano delivery of natural substances as prospective autophagy modulators in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most destructive type of malignant brain tumor in humans due to cancer relapse. Latest studies have indicated that cancer cells are more reliant on autophagy for survival than non-cancer cells. Autophagy is entitled as programmed cell death type II and studies imply that it is a comeback of cancer cells to innumerable anti-cancer therapies. To diminish the adverse consequences of chemotherapeutics, numerous herbs of natural origin have been retained in cancer treatments. Additionally, autophagy induction occurs via their tumor suppressive actions that could cause cell senescence and increase apoptosis-independent cell death. However, most of the drugs have poor solubility and thus nano drug delivery systems possess excessive potential to improve the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of encapsulated drugs.

"""Human gamma-delta (gammadelta) T cell therapy for glioblastoma: A novel alternative to overcome challenges of adoptive immune cell therapy.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common brain malignancy with devastating prognosis. Numerous clinical trials using various target therapeutic agents have failed and recent clinical trials using check point inhibitors also failed to provide survival benefits for glioblastoma patients. Adoptive T cell transfer is suggested as a novel therapeutic approach that has exhibited promise in preliminary clinical studies. However, the clinical outcomes are inconsistent, and there are several limitations of current adoptive T cell transfer strategies for glioblastoma treatment. As an alternative cell therapy, gamma-delta (γδ) T cells have been recently introduced for several cancers including glioblastoma. Since the leading role of γδ T cells is immune surveillance by recognizing a broad range of ligands including stress molecules, phosphoantigens, or lipid antigens, recent studies have suggested the potential benefits of γδ T cell transfer against glioblastomas. However, γδ T cells, as a small subset (1-5%) of T cells in human peripheral blood, are relatively unknown compared to conventional alpha-beta (αβ) T cells. In this context, our study introduced γδ T cells as an alternative and novel option to overcome several challenges regarding immune cell therapy in glioblastoma treatment. We described the unique characteristics and advantages of γδ T cells compared to conventional αβ T cells and summarize several recent preclinical studies using human gamma-delta T cell therapy for glioblastomas.

"""Bioscaffold-based study of glioblastoma cell behavior and drug delivery for tumor therapy.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a severe form of brain cancer with an average five-year survival rate of 6.7%. Current treatment strategies include surgical resection of the tumor area and lining the lesion site with therapeutics, which offer only a moderate impact on increasing survival rates. Drug-testing models based on the monolayer cell culture method may partially explain the lack of advancement in effective GBM treatment, because this model is limited in its ability to show heterogeneous cell-cell and cell-environment interactions as tumor cells in the in vivo state. The development of bioscaffold-based culture models is an important improvement in GBM research, preclinical trials, and targeted drug testing, through better mimicking of the heterogeneity of tumor environmental conditions. A major hurdle towards better GBM outcomes is in delivering medication across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which normally prevents the crossing of materials into the treatment site. The delivery of therapeutics using bioscaffolds is a potential means of overcoming the BBB and could potentially facilitate long-lasting drug release. A number of natural and synthetic materials have been studied for their biodegradability, toxicity, distribution, and pharmaceutical stability, which are needed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of glioblastoma treatment.

Immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at bolstering the immune response while neutralizing immunosuppression will play a critical role in improving treatment outcomes for glioblastoma patients. In vivo murine models of glioma provide an invaluable resource to achieving that end, and their use is an essential part of the preclinical workup for novel therapeutics that need to be tested in animal models prior to testing experimental therapies in patients. In this article, we review five contemporary immunocompetent mouse models, GL261 (C57BL/6), GL26 (C57BL/6) CT-2A (C57BL/6), SMA-560 (VM/Dk), and 4C8 (B6D2F1), each of which offer a suitable platform for testing novel immunotherapeutic approaches.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24779345

"""Hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation for progressive glioblastoma: twelve years' experience of a single center.""","""Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors and the role of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) as a re-irradiation technique in the management of progressive glioblastoma. Methods: The records of 77 previously irradiated glioblastoma patients who progressed and received second course hypofractionated SRT (1-5 fractions) between 2009 and 2022 in our department were evaluated retrospectively. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was utilized for all statistical analyses. Results: The median time to progression from the end of initial radiotherapy was 14 months (range, 6-68 months). The most common SRT schedule was 30 Gy (range, 18-50 Gy) in 5 fractions (range, 1-5 fractions). The median follow-up after SRT was 9 months (range, 3-80 months). One-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates after SRT were 46% and 35%, respectively. Re-irradiation dose and the presence of pseudoprogression were both significant independent positive prognostic factors for both OS (p = 0.009 and p = 0.04, respectively) and PFS (p = 0.008 and p = 0.04, respectively). For PFS, progression-free interval > 14 months was also a prognostic factor (p = 0.04). The treatment was well tolerated without significant acute toxicity. During follow-up, radiation necrosis was observed in 17 patients (22%), and 14 (82%) of them were asymptomatic. Conclusion: Hypofractionated SRT is an effective treatment approach for patients with progressive glioblastoma.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) demonstrate novel mechanisms of targeting the elusive CSCs with greater selectivity - promising therapeutic potential against solid tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) that are resistant to conventional treatment. In general, OVs have failed to translate the efficacy from bench to bedside. The success of OVs rely on the hypothesis that eliminating CSCs is key to preventing recurrence. However, newly emerging evidence of CSC plasticity challenge this hypothesis by proposing that the CSC pool can be regenerated from non-CSCs post-treatment. We review this evidence surrounding the CSC hypothesis to propose an original perspective on why several advanced OVs may be failing to reflect their true potential in clinical trials.

Development of effective therapeutic strategies against GSCs requires both specificity of targeting and intracranial penetration through the blood-brain barrier. We have previously demonstrated the use of in vitro and in vivo phage display biopanning strategies to isolate glioblastoma targeting peptides. Here we selected a 7-amino acid peptide, AWEFYFP, which was independently isolated in both the in vitro and in vivo screens and demonstrated that it was able to target GSCs over differentiated glioma cells and non-neoplastic brain cells. When conjugated to Cyanine 5.5 and intravenously injected into mice with intracranially xenografted glioblastoma, the peptide localized to the site of the tumor, demonstrating intracranial tumor targeting specificity. Immunoprecipitation of the peptide with GSC proteins revealed Cadherin 2 as the glioblastoma cell surface receptor targeted by the peptides. Peptide targeting of Cadherin 2 on GSCs was confirmed through ELISA and in vitro binding analysis. Interrogation of glioblastoma databases demonstrated that Cadherin 2 expression correlated with tumor grade and survival. These results confirm that phage display can be used to isolate unique tumor-targeting peptides specific for glioblastoma.

QUESTION 1 : In adult patients (aged 65 and under) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, is the addition of radiation therapy (RT) more beneficial than management without RT in improving survival? Recommendations: Level I: Radiation therapy (RT) is recommended for the treatment of newly diagnosed malignant glioblastoma in adults. QUESTION 2 : In adult patients (aged 65 and under) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, is the RT regimen of 60 Gy given in 2 Gy daily fractions more beneficial than alternative regimens in providing survival benefit while minimizing toxicity? Recommendations: Level I: Treatment schemes should include dosage of up to 60 Gy given in 2 Gy daily fractions that includes the enhancing area. QUESTION 3 : In adult patients (aged 65 and under) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, is a tailored target volume superior to regional RT for reduction of radiation-induced toxicity while maintaining efficacy? Recommendation: Level II: It is recommended that radiation therapy planning include 1-2 cm margin around the radiographically T1 weighted contrast-enhancing tumor volume or the T2 weighted abnormality on MRI. Level III: Recalculation of the radiation volume during RT treatment may be necessary to reduce the radiated volume of normal brain since the volume of surgical defect will change during the long period of RT. QUESTION 4 : In adult patients (aged 65 and under) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, does the addition of RT of the subventricular zone to standard tumor volume treatment improve tumor control and overall survival? Recommendation: No recommendation can be formulated as there is contradictory evidence in favor of and against intentional radiation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) QUESTION 5 : In elderly (age > 65 years) and/or frail patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, does the addition of RT to surgical intervention improve disease control and overall survival? Recommendation: Level I: Radiation therapy is recommended for treatment of elderly and frail patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma to improve overall survival. QUESTION 6 : In elderly (age > 65 years) and/or frail patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, does modification of RT dose and fractionation scheme from standard regimens decrease toxicity and improve disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level II: Short RT treatment schemes are recommended in frail and elderly patients as compared to conventional 60 Gy given in 2 daily fractions because overall survival is not different while RT risk profile is better for the short RT scheme. Level II: The 40.05 Gy dose given in 15 fractions or 25 Gy dose given in 5 fractions or 34 Gy dose given in 10 fractions should be considered as appropriate doses for Short RT treatments in elderly and/or frail patients. QUESTION 7 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is there advantage to delaying the initiation of RT instead of starting it 2 weeks after surgical intervention in decreasing radiation-induced toxicity and improving disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level III: It is suggested that RT for patients with newly diagnosed GBM starts within 6 weeks of surgical intervention as compared to later times. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the optimal specific post-operative day within the 6 weeks interval to start RT for adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma that have undergone surgical resection. QUESTION 8 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma is Image-Modulated RT (IMRT) or similar techniques as effective as standard regional RT in providing tumor control and improve survival? Recommendation: Level III: There is no evidence that IMRT is a better RT delivering modality when compared to conventional RT in improving overall survival in adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Hence, IMRT should not be preferred over the Conventional RT delivery modality. QUESTION 9 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma does the use of radiosensitizers with RT improve the efficacy of RT as determined by disease control and overall survival? Recommendation: Level III: Iododeoxyuridine is not recommended to be used as radiosensitizer during RT treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM QUESTION 10 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is the use of Ultrafractionated RT superior to standard fractionation regimens in improving disease control and survival? Recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to formulate a recommendation regarding the use of ultrafractionated RT schemes and patient population that could benefit from it. QUESTION 11 : In patients with poor prognosis with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is hypofractionated RT indicated instead of a standard fractionation regimen as measured by extent of toxicity, disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level I: Hypofractionated RT schemes may be used for patients with poor prognosis and limited survival without compromising response. There is insufficient evidence in the literature for us to be able to recommend the optimal hypofractionated RT scheme that will confer longest overall survival and/or confer the same overall survival with less toxicities and shorter treatment time. QUESTION 12 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is the addition of brachytherapy to standard fractionated RT indicated to improve disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level I: Brachytherapy as a boost to external beam RT has not been shown to be beneficial and is not recommended in the routine management of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. QUESTION 13 : In elderly patients (> 65 year old) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma under what circumstances is accelerated hyperfractionated RT indicated instead of a standard fractionation regimen as measured by extent of toxicity, disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level III: Accelerated Hyperfractionated RT with a total RT dose of 45 Gy or 48 Gy has been shown to shorten the treatment time without detriment in survival when compared to conventional external beam RT and should be considered as an option for treatment of elderly patients with newly diagnosed GBM. QUESTION 14 : In adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is the addition of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) boost to conventional standard fractionated RT indicated to improve disease control and survival? Recommendation: Level I: Stereotactic Radiosurgery boost to external beam RT has not been shown to be beneficial and is not recommended in patients undergoing routine management of newly diagnosed malignant glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33215344

Current FDA-approved treatments include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, while hyperthermia, immunotherapy, and most relevantly, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery systems or combinations thereof have shown promise in preclinical studies. Drug-carrying NPs are a promising approach to brain delivery as a result of their potential to facilitate the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via two main types of transcytosis mechanisms: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) and receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). Their ability to accumulate in the brain can thus provide local sustained release of tumoricidal drugs at or near the site of GBM tumors. NP-based drug delivery has the potential to significantly reduce drug-related toxicity, increase specificity, and consequently improve the lifespan and quality of life of patients with GBM. Due to significant advances in the understanding of the molecular etiology and pathology of GBM, the efficacy of drugs loaded into vectors targeting this disease has increased in both preclinical and clinical settings. Multitargeting NPs, such as those incorporating multiple specific targeting ligands, are an innovative technology that can lead to decreased off-target effects while simultaneously having increased accumulation and action specifically at the tumor site. Targeting ligands can include antibodies, or fragments thereof, and peptides or small molecules, which can result in a more controlled drug delivery system compared to conventional drug treatments.

Using the previously characterized calibration factor, power measurements were converted to fluence rate values to obtain the transfer function. No thermal elevation was observed during a 2-h temperature test, and the impact of protoporphyrin IX on brain optical properties was considered negligible. Conclusion: A discussion of experimental precision is presented. The light duration determined by the abacus had a standard deviation of <1 min. This value is weak compared with the total illumination time necessary to treat one patient. The main advantage of our device lies in its straightforward implementation of intraoperative PDT for neurosurgery with acceptable dosimetry and easy treatment time.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28942677
"""Emerging role of combination of all-trans retinoic acid and interferon-gamma as chemoimmunotherapy in the management of human glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most malignant and common type of brain tumor with devastating outcome. Because current treatment modalities are mostly ineffective in controlling and curing glioblastoma, new and innovative therapeutic strategies must be developed. This article describes recent advances in chemoimmunotherapy, which is combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, against glioblastoma. We provide an overview of available treatment options for glioblastomas, gaps in our knowledge of immune recognition of these malignant tumors, and chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents that need to be further explored for designing novel chemoimmunotherapeutic strategy for the management of human glioblastomas. Our recent study demonstrated that combination of the chemotherapeutic agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the immunotherapeutic agent interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) could concurrently induce differentiation, apoptotic death, and immune components in two different human glioblastoma cell lines. We propose that combination of ATRA and IFN-gamma can become an efficacious chemoimmunotherapy for the treatment of human glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17676389
"""Synthetic and systems biology principles in the design of programmable oncolytic virus immunotherapies for glioblastoma.""","""Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapeutic agents with promising preclinical results for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) but have shown limited success in recent clinical trials. Advanced bioengineering principles from disciplines such as synthetic and systems biology are needed to overcome the current challenges faced in developing effective OV-based immunotherapies for GBMs, including off-target effects and poor clinical responses. Synthetic biology is an emerging field that focuses on the development of synthetic DNA constructs that encode networks of genes and proteins (synthetic genetic circuits) to perform novel functions, whereas systems biology is an analytical framework that enables the study of complex interactions between host pathways and these synthetic genetic circuits. In this review, the authors summarize synthetic and systems biology concepts for developing programmable, logic-based OVs to treat GBMs. Programmable OVs can increase selectivity for tumor cells and enhance the local immunological response using synthetic genetic circuits. The authors discuss key principles for developing programmable OV-based immunotherapies, including how to 1) select an appropriate chassis, a vector that carries a synthetic genetic circuit, and 2) design a synthetic genetic circuit that can be programmed to sense key signals in the GBM microenvironment and trigger release of a therapeutic payload. To illustrate these principles, some original laboratory data are included, highlighting the need for systems biology studies, as well as some preliminary network analyses in preparation for synthetic biology applications. Examples from the literature of state-of-the-art synthetic genetic circuits that can be packaged into leading candidate OV chassis are also surveyed and discussed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33524942

The authors explored survival rates and factors associated with long-term survival in patients harboring a glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Methods: In an observational, retrospective, single-center study, the authors examined the medical records of 976 adults newly diagnosed with supratentorial glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype between January 2000 and January 2021. They analyzed clinical-, imaging-, and treatment-related factors associated with 2-year and 5-year survival. Results: The median overall survival was 11.2 months (12.2 months for patients included after 2005 and the introduction of standard combined chemoradiotherapy). The median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (10.0 months for patients included after 2005). Overall, 17.6% of patients reached a 2-year overall survival, while 2.2% of patients reached a 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, 6.6% of patients survived 2 years without progression, while 1.1% of patients survived 5 years without progression. Two factors that were consistently associated with 2-year and 5-year survival were first-line oncological treatment with standard combined chemoradiotherapy and methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter. Other factors that were significantly associated with 2-year or 5-year survival were age at diagnosis ≤ 60 years, headaches or signs of raised intracranial pressure at diagnosis, cortical contact of contrast enhancement, no contrast enhancement crossing the midline on initial imaging, total or subtotal tumor resection, and a second line of oncological treatment at recurrence. Within 21 cases of 5-year survival, 18 were confirmed to be glioblastomas, IDH-wildtype, and 7 of the 5-year survivors (38.9%) had additional genetic alterations: 3 cases had an FGFR mutation or fusion, 3 cases had a PIK3CA mutation, 1 case had a PTPN11 mutation, and 1 case had a PMS2 mutation in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome. Conclusions: Five-year overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype is extremely low. Predictors of a longer survival are mostly treatment factors, emphasizing the importance of a complete oncological treatment plan, when achievable. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype 5-year survivors could be screened for actionable targets in case of recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39213667

Herein, we describe an efficiently biodegradable selenium-engineered mesoporous silica nanocapsule, initiated by high-energy X-ray irradiation and employed for at-site RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit rrGBM invasion and achieve maximum therapeutic benefit. Our radiation-triggered RNAi nanocapsule showed high physiological stability, good blood-brain barrier transcytosis, and potent rrGBM accumulation. An intratumoral RNAi nanocapsule permitted low-dose X-ray radiation-triggered dissociation for cofilin-1 knockdown, inhibiting rrGBM infiltration. More importantly, tumor suppression was further amplified by electron-affinity aminoimidazole products converted from metronidazole polymers under X-ray radiation-exacerbated hypoxia, which sensitized cell apoptosis to ionizing radiation by fixing reactive oxygen species-induced DNA lesions. In vivo experiments confirmed that our RNAi nanocapsule reduced tumor growth and invasion, prolonging survival in an orthotopic rrGBM model. Generally, we present a promising radiosensitizer that would effectively improve rrGBM-patient outcomes with low-dose X-ray irradiation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36759969
"""Resistance Mechanisms and Barriers to Successful Immunotherapy for Treating Glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is inevitably refractory to surgery and chemoradiation. The hope for immunotherapy has yet to be realised in the treatment of GBM. Immune checkpoint blockade antibodies, particularly those targeting the Programme death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway, have improved the prognosis in a range of cancers. However, its use in combination with chemoradiation or as monotherapy has proved unsuccessful in treating GBM. This review focuses on our current knowledge of barriers to immunotherapy success in treating GBM, such as diminished pre-existing anti-tumour immunity represented by low levels of PD-L1 expression, low tumour mutational burden and a severely exhausted T-cell tumour infiltrate. Likewise, systemic T-cell immunosuppression is seen driven by tumoural factors and corticosteroid use. Furthermore, unique anatomical differences with primary intracranial tumours such as the blood-brain barrier, the type of antigen-presenting cells and lymphatic drainage contribute to differences in treatment success compared to extracranial tumours. There are, however, shared characteristics with those known in other tumours such as the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. We conclude with a summary of ongoing and future immune combination strategies in GBM, which are representative of the next wave in immuno-oncology therapeutics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31973059

Although our understanding of the molecular complexity of glioblastoma has increased over the years, the path to developing effective targeted therapeutic strategies is wrought with many challenges, as described in this review. These challenges include disease heterogeneity, clinical and genomic patient variability, limited number of effective treatments, clinical trial inefficiency, drug delivery, and clinical trial support and accrual.

Dendritic cell vaccination (DCV) is an active immunotherapy that aims at inducing an antitumoral immune response. Numerous DCV trials have been performed, vaccinating hundreds of GBM patients and confirming feasibility and safety. Many of these studies reported induction of an antitumoral immune response and indicated improved survival after DCV. However, two controlled randomized trials failed to detect a survival benefit. This raises the question of whether the promising concept of DCV may not hold true or whether we are not yet realizing the full potential of this therapeutic approach. Here, we discuss the results of recent vaccination trials, relevant parameters of the vaccines themselves and of their application, and possible synergies between DCV and other therapeutic approaches targeting the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34795675
"""Pharmacometabolomics Informs Quantitative Radiomics for Glioblastoma Diagnostic Innovation.""","""Applications of omics systems biology technologies have enormous promise for radiology and diagnostics in surgical fields. In this context, the emerging fields of radiomics (a systems scale approach to radiology using a host of technologies, including omics) and pharmacometabolomics (use of metabolomics for patient and disease stratification and guiding precision medicine) offer much synergy for diagnostic innovation in surgery, particularly in neurosurgery. This synthesis of omics fields and applications is timely because diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors still challenges decision-making. Considering the vast heterogeneity in brain tumors, disease phenotypes, and interindividual variability in surgical and chemotherapy outcomes, we believe that diagnostic accuracy can be markedly improved by quantitative radiomics coupled to pharmacometabolomics and related health information technologies while optimizing economic costs of traditional diagnostics. In this expert review, we present an innovation analysis on a systems-level multi-omics approach toward diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors. For this, we suggest that glioblastomas serve as a useful application paradigm. We performed a literature search on PubMed for articles published in English between 2006 and 2016. We used the search terms 'radiomics,' 'glioblastoma,' 'biomarkers,' 'pharmacogenomics,' 'pharmacometabolomics,' 'pharmacometabonomics/pharmacometabolomics,' 'collaborative informatics,' and 'precision medicine.' A list of the top 4 insights we derived from this literature analysis is presented in this study. For example, we found that (i) tumor grading needs to be better refined, (ii) diagnostic precision should be improved, (iii) standardization in radiomics is lacking, and (iv) quantitative radiomics needs to prove clinical implementation. We conclude with an interdisciplinary call to the metabolomics, pharmacy/pharmacology, radiology, and surgery communities that pharmacometabolomics coupled to information technologies (chemoinformatics tools, databases, collaborative systems) can inform quantitative radiomics, thus translating Big Data and information growth to knowledge growth, rational drug development and diagnostics innovation for glioblastomas, and possibly in other brain tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28816643

Patient-individualized, spherically-symmetric simulations of the standard-of-care and optimized plans were compared in terms of several biological metrics. Results: The integrated model generated spatially non-uniform doses that, when compared to the standard-of-care protocol, resulted in a 67% to 93% decrease in equivalent uniform dose to normal tissue, while the therapeutic ratio, the ratio of tumor equivalent uniform dose to that of normal tissue, increased between 50% to 265%. Applying a novel metric of treatment response (Days Gained) to the patient-individualized simulation results predicted that the optimized plans would have a significant impact on delaying tumor progression, with increases from 21% to 105% for 9 of 11 patients.

"""Radiotherapy protocols for mouse cancer model.""","""Radiotherapy is a crucial treatment modality for cancer patients, with approximately 60% of individuals undergoing ionizing radiation as part of their disease management. In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward minimizing irradiation fields through the use of image-guided dosimetry and innovative technologies. These advancements allow for selective irradiation, delivering higher local doses while reducing the number of treatment sessions. Consequently, computer-assisted methods have significantly enhanced the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the curative and palliative treatment of various cancers. Although radiation therapy alone can effectively achieve local control in some cancer types, it may not be sufficient for others. As a result, further preclinical research is necessary to explore novel approaches including new schedules of radiotherapy treatments. Unfortunately, there is a concerning lack of correlation between clinical outcomes and experiments conducted on mouse models. We hypothesize that this disparity arises from the differences in irradiation strategies employed in preclinical studies compared to those used in clinical practice, which ultimately affects the translatability of findings to patients. In this study, we present two comprehensive radiotherapy protocols for the treatment of orthotopic melanoma and glioblastoma tumors. These protocols utilize a small animal radiation research platform, which is an ideal radiation device for delivering localized and precise X-ray doses to the tumor mass.

Herein, we report a case of GBM in a 39-year-old woman who underwent surgical resection, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and seven courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. The patient then complained of an instable gait and hearing loss. Imaging studies demonstrated that although the primary intracranial tumors were well-controlled by treatment, contralateral cerebellopontine angle seeding dissemination was present. The patient died 3 months after the diagnosis of seeding dissemination. In light of a previous report and our current case, heightened awareness could promote surgical strategies that minimize the possibility of dissemination, including avoiding ventricular entry or a no-touch strategy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35854630
"""Nanocarriers and nonviral methods for delivering antiangiogenic factors for glioblastoma therapy: the story so far.""","""Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is an essential component of glioblastoma (GB) progression. The development of angiogenesis inhibitor therapy, including treatments targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in particular, raised new hopes for the treatment of GB, but no Phase III clinical trial to date has reported survival benefits relative to standard treatment. There are several possible reasons for this limited efficacy, including VEGF-independent angiogenesis, induction of tumor invasion, and inefficient antiangiogenic factor delivery to the tumor. Efforts have been made to overcome these limitations by identifying new angiogenesis inhibitors that target angiogenesis through different mechanisms of action without inducing tumor invasion, and through the development of viral and nonviral delivery methods to improve antiangiogenic activity. Herein, we describe the nonviral methods, including convection-enhanced delivery devices, implantable polymer devices, nanocarriers, and cellular vehicles, to deliver antiangiogenic factors. We focus on those evaluated in intracranial (orthotopic) animal models of GB, the most relevant models of this disease, as they reproduce the clinical scenario of tumor progression and therapy response encountered in GB patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31040671
"""Combination of US hyperthermia and radiotherapy on a preclinical glioblastoma model.""","""In this work the effect of combining ultrasound (US) hyperthermia (HT) with radiotherapy (RT) was investigated. The treatment was applied to a GBM xenograft nude mouse model obtained by injecting 2 × 10 6 U87 luc+ cells. The combined treatment group received 6 Gy and HT at 43 ∘ for 8 min. The ultrasound field was generated by a closed-loop computationally controlled system, consisting of a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducer with centre frequency 3.57 MHz, a power amplifier, a function generator and a MATLAB controller. A mechanical cone adaptor has been designed to use the HIFU beam at a pre-defined post-focal distance. Two thermocouples were placed between the mechanical cone and the mice skin to measure and control the temperature during the HT treatment. Radiotherapy was carried out by using a dedicated small animal image guided radiotherapy system. Measurements of tumor volume performed with a caliper showed good tumor control for the RT-HT group with respect to the RT or control groups for up to 21 days after treatment. The mean value of the normalized (before therapy) tumor volume was almost equal to 0.5 for two weeks after treatment with an increase to 1.5 at sacrifice. The control and HT groups showed a higher value of about 1.5 during the first two weeks and 3.5 at the end of the follow-up period. We concluded that the use of HT as a radiosensitizer can improve the outcome for glioblastoma treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39191985

As a result, an optimal treatment strategy has not yet been identified. A review of the characteristics of the disease as well as the effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities would help in optimizing the treatment paradigm. Methods: We performed a detailed clinical, radiographic, and pathologic retrospective review of five patients (three boys and two girls, average age at presentation 7.2 years (range, 3-14 years)) and surveyed the literature for an additional 55 cases. Results: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging usually revealed a large lesion with minimal edema, heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and a discrete border. Subtotal tumor resection was performed in two patients and gross total resection in three patients. Immunostaining of the tumor cells with antisera to glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin was variably positive. Adjuvant therapy included local radiation and chemotherapy in all followed patients. Tumor recurrence was seen in two patients. Patients were followed from 2 months to 3.5 years (mean, 12 months). Two patients were dead at last follow-up with a mean survival of 9.5 months. Conclusions: The prognosis for pediatric patients with cerebellar glioblastomas is dismal, even when compared to adult counterparts or other malignant posterior fossa tumors in children. Cerebellar glioblastomas have a tendency to recur and disseminate despite treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. The poor outcomes seen with this tumor suggest that the optimal treatment strategy has yet to be elucidated and much work needs to be done.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23299302

"""A Syx-RhoA-Dia1 signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive tumors that lack effective treatments. Here, we show that the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx promotes GBM cell growth both in vitro and in orthotopic xenografts derived from patients with GBM. Growth defects upon Syx depletion are attributed to prolonged mitosis, increased DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis, mediated by altered mRNA and protein expression of various cell cycle regulators. These effects are phenocopied by depletion of the Rho downstream effector Dia1 and are due, at least in part, to increased phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention, and reduced activity of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. Furthermore, targeting Syx signaling cooperates with radiation treatment and temozolomide (TMZ) to decrease viability in GBM cells, irrespective of their inherent response to TMZ. The data indicate that a Syx-RhoA-Dia1-YAP/TAZ signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in GBM and argue for its targeting for cancer treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427593

"""Regulation of pathological blood-brain barrier for intracranial enhanced drug delivery and anti-glioblastoma therapeutics.""","""The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an essential component in regulating and maintaining the homeostatic microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). During the occurrence and development of glioblastoma (GBM), BBB is pathologically destroyed with a marked increase in permeability. Due to the obstruction of the BBB, current strategies for GBM therapeutics still obtain a meager success rate and may lead to systemic toxicity. Moreover, chemotherapy could promote pathological BBB functional restoration, which results in significantly reduced intracerebral transport of therapeutic agents during multiple administrations of GBM and the eventual failure of GBM chemotherapy. The effective delivery of intracerebral drugs still faces severe challenges. However, strategies that regulate the pathological BBB to enhance the transport of therapeutic agents across the barrier may provide new opportunities for the effective and safe treatment of GBM.

Between 1995 and 1998, 50 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas underwent surgery and were subsequently treated with 200 mg day(-1) tamoxifen continuously, 3 cycles of carboplatin (300 mg m(-2)), and radiotherapy. Survival data for a historical control group were calculated from respective prognostic indices and were obtained from studies with comparable patient populations treated with operation and radiotherapy only. In our study, the median time to tumor progression was 30 weeks and the median survival time (MST) 55 weeks (95% confidence interval: 46-63 weeks). The MST of the control group (48 weeks) showed to be within this interval. In addition to already known prognostic factors in malignant gliomas (age, Karnofsky performance score, extent of tumor resection), the gender (females lived longer than males, p = 0.0025) showed to influence survival. Serious side effects (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) occurred in 6 patients. A high incidence of multifocal tumor recurrences (33%), which might be related to study-treatment, was observed.

Exercise modalities of cardiorespiratory, resistance, and balance training were designed on generic recommendations of various cancer populations and literature review. Results: Our case attended all possible sessions without experiencing adverse effects, and improved in aerobe power (24%), muscle strength (0-38%), standing balance (71%), walking ability (9%), and QOL domains of 'Global Health Status/QoL' and 'Physical functioning.' Conclusions: Based on this single case, exercise rehabilitation has the ability to maintain or improve functional performance and QOL domains even during heavy treatments. It also implies that patients with GBM are capable and may be willing to participate in exercise rehabilitation if supervised by physical therapists. Implications for rehabilitation The use of exercise as part of rehabilitation still needs attention in strong methodology studies of patients with gliomas.

"""Role of microRNAs in mechanisms of glioblastoma resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.""","""Low-grade gliomas and multiform glioblastoma are characterized by highly pronounced anaplasia, malignization, proliferation, and invasiveness; moreover, they are highly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. The very low efficiency of traditional approaches in the treatment of patients with glioblastomas is due to the intensive invasive growth of the tumor resulting in deep infiltration of adjacent normal perivascular and nervous tissue and formation of areas of perineural infiltration differently remote from the tumor epicenter. MicroRNAs are key posttranscriptional regulators of gene activities, and their expression is markedly increased in tumors, in particular in gliomas. MicroRNAs have been shown to promote the growth, proliferation, migration, and survival of tumor stem and non-stem cells. However, a population of microRNA possessing antitumor effects is also detected in gliomas. As a rule, the expression of antitumor microRNAs is suppressed in tumors. In this review, we consider microRNAs, their influence on radio- and chemoresistance of gliomas, and prospects for their use as specific agents in targeted therapy of gliomas. The pool of these microRNAs has distinct therapeutic value, because on use in combined therapy it can decrease the resistance of glioma tumor stem cells to existing pharmaceuticals and improve the efficiency of radio- and chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23590435

AGuIX nanoparticles have a high radiosensitizing potential, a selective and long-lasting accumulation in tumors and a rapid renal elimination. Their therapeutic effect has been proven in vivo on several tumor models, including glioblastoma with a potential synergetic effect when combined with TMZ based chemoradiotherapy, and they are currently evaluated in 4 ongoing Phase Ib and II clinical trials in 4 indications (brain metastases, lung, pancreatic and cervix cancers) (> 100 patients received AGuIX). Thus, they could offer new perspectives for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The aim of this study is to determine the recommended dose of AGuIX as a radiosensitizer in combination with radiotherapy and TMZ during the concurrent radio-chemotherapy period for phase II (RP2D) and to estimate the efficacy of the combination. Methods: NANO-GBM is a multicenter, phase I/II, randomized, open-label, non-comparative, therapeutic trial. According to a dose escalation scheme driven by a TITE-CRM design, 3 dose levels of AGuIX (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) will be tested in phase I added to standard concomitant radio-chemotherapy. Patients with grade IV glioblastoma, not operated or partially operated, with a KPS ≥ 70% will be eligible for the study. The primary endpoints are i) for phase I, the RP2D of AGuIX, with DLT defined as any grade 3-4 NCI-CTCAE toxicity and ii) for phase II, the 6-month progression-free survival rate. The pharmacokinetics, distribution of nanoparticles, tolerance of the combination, neurological status, overall survival (median, 6-month and 12-month rates), response to treatment, and progression-free survival (median and 12-month rates) will be assessed as secondary objectives.

"""Combining drugs and radiotherapy: from the bench to the bedside.""","""Purpose of review: The current standard care of treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is never curative and exclusively involves the use of cytoxics upfront (e.g., radiation and chemotherapy). Current clinical protocols involve the use of single-agent targeted therapies, which inhibit specific pathways. Given the functional redundancies present in human tumors and escape mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that such a monotherapy approach will be successful in the treatment of GBM. Future directions of therapy for GBMs will likely involve the use of therapeutic cocktails, including more than one target specific inhibitors based on tumor escape mechanism, genetic, epigenetic and molecular signatures. This review addresses some of the relevant issues. Recent findings: Correlative clinical studies from various clinical trials and preclinical studies have provided the meticulous use of chemotherapeutics and radiation based on molecular profiling of tumors. Alkylating agents such as temozolomide lose their efficacy if DNA repair enzyme expression is upregulated. The alternative strategies include targeting the enzyme or one can use poly (ADP) ribose inhibitor to inhibit base excision repair pathway rather than mismatch repair pathway. Currently, several inhibitors in this category are in clinical trials. Next, we have addressed new avenues including radiosensitizers, hypoxia, metabolism, angiogenesis, invasive and infiltrative nature of tumors and potential molecular targets, which can be exploited for clinical trials. Finally, we have included some aspect of genome-wide association studies and correlative analysis and the lessons learned to design better clinical trials. Summary: Advances in profiling the noncoding RNAs, genetic, epigenetic profiles, metabolomics, genomics and proteomics may uncover important resistance mechanisms in GBM. Personalized therapy using various therapeutic cocktails targeting these resistance mechanisms may prove even more effective in the future management of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19770758
"""Disentangling the therapeutic tactics in GBM: From bench to bedside and beyond.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and malignant form of adult brain tumor with a high mortality rate and dismal prognosis. The present standard treatment comprising surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy using temozolomide can broaden patient's survival to some extent. However, the advantages are not palliative due to the development of resistance to the drug and tumor recurrence following the multimodal treatment approaches due to both intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of GBM. One of the major contributors to temozolomide resistance is O6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Furthermore, deficiency of mismatch repair, base excision repair, and cytoprotective autophagy adds to temozolomide obstruction. Rising proof additionally showed that a small population of cells displaying certain stem cell markers, known as glioma stem cells, adds on to the resistance and tumor progression. Collectively, these findings necessitate the discovery of novel therapeutic avenues for treating glioblastoma. As of late, after understanding the pathophysiology and biology of GBM, some novel therapeutic discoveries, such as drug repurposing, targeted molecules, immunotherapies, antimitotic therapies, and microRNAs, have been developed as new potential treatments for glioblastoma.

The currently available anticancer therapeutics have less than optimal usefulness for GBM, mainly owing to delivery problems to the tumor, including those due to blood-brain barrier. Several new therapies in development for GBM will require innovative methods of delivery besides the current practice of direct introduction of drugs and devices into the tumor. Nanobiotechnology, particularly nanoparticles, is making a significant contribution to the improvement of drug delivery in cancer and many of these technologies can be applied to GBM. Nanobiotechnology can provide a platform for combination of diagnostics, therapeutics, and its delivery to the tumor with subsequent monitoring of response. These technologies are reviewed and the prospects of improvement of therapeutic delivery to the brain are excellent during the next 5 years. Curing of GBM, however, depends on discovery of an anticancer agent that will destroy GBM completely.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425491
"""Survivin knockdown and concurrent 4-HPR treatment controlled human glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo.""","""Survivin is highly expressed in most cancers, including glioblastoma, and it plays a significant role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting tumor growth. Treatment of cancer cells with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) induces apoptosis through destabilization of mitochondrial membrane and activation of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways. We studied the efficacy of a combination of survivin knockdown and 4-HPR treatment to induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion, angiogenesis, and growth of human glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo. Using a plasmid encoding survivin shRNA, we downregulated survivin in glioblastoma U251MG and U118MG cells and simultaneously treated with 1 µM 4-HPR for 48 hours. Cells following treatments were subjected to the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and invasion assays. In vivo angiogenesis and tumor regression studies were performed in nude mice. TUNEL assay demonstrated apoptosis in more than 80% of cells after survivin knockdown and 4-HPR treatment. Matrigel invasion assays demonstrated marked decreases in tumor cell invasion. In vivo angiogenesis studies depicted a remarkable inhibition of neovascularization due to the knockdown of survivin and 4-HPR treatment. Imaging of intracerebral tumorigenesis and longitudinal studies on subcutaneous solid tumor formation showed dramatic decreases in tumorigenesis and solid tumor progression, respectively, after treatment with the combination. Studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor regression demonstrated marked decreases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen, metalloproteinase-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and CD31 in solid tumors. Our data demonstrated that survivin knockdown and concurrent 4-HPR treatment could be a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling growth of human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679253

Indeed, patients responding to these agents may experience a long-lasting response. Recently, results of interventional clinical trials investigated the role of ICIs in patients with glioblastoma. Results of these studies suggested that only a small percentage of these patients could benefit from these agents. Research of predictive markers assumes a critical importance to adequately select patients likely to benefit from ICIs.

"""Physiological Imaging Methods for Evaluating Response to Immunotherapies in Glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults, with a dismal prognosis despite aggressive multi-modal therapy. Immunotherapy is currently being evaluated as an alternate treatment modality for recurrent GBMs in clinical trials. These immunotherapeutic approaches harness the patient's immune response to fight and eliminate tumor cells. Standard MR imaging is not adequate for response assessment to immunotherapy in GBM patients even after using refined response assessment criteria secondary to amplified immune response. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of effective and alternative neuroimaging techniques for accurate response assessment. To this end, some groups have reported the potential of diffusion and perfusion MR imaging and amino acid-based positron emission tomography techniques in evaluating treatment response to different immunotherapeutic regimens in GBMs. The main goal of these techniques is to provide definitive metrics of treatment response at earlier time points for making informed decisions on future therapeutic interventions. This review provides an overview of available immunotherapeutic approaches used to treat GBMs. It discusses the limitations of conventional imaging and potential utilities of physiologic imaging techniques in the response assessment to immunotherapies.

"""The need of radiotherapy optimization for glioblastomas considering immune responses.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common of malignant primary brain tumors and one of the tumors with the poorest prognosis for which the overall survival rate has not significantly improved despite recent advances in treatment techniques and therapeutic drugs. Since the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the immune response to tumors has attracted increasing attention. Treatments affecting the immune system have been attempted for various tumors, including glioblastomas, but little has been shown to be effective. It has been found that the reason for this is that glioblastomas have a high ability to evade attacks from the immune system, and that the lymphocyte depletion associated with treatment can reduce its immune function. Currently, research to elucidate the resistance of glioblastomas to the immune system and development of new immunotherapies are being vigorously carried out. Targeting of radiation therapy for glioblastomas varies among guidelines and clinical trials. Based on early reports, target definitions with wide margins are common, but there are also reports that narrowing the margins does not make a significant difference in treatment outcome. It has also been suggested that a large number of lymphocytes in the blood are irradiated by the irradiation treatment to a wide area in a large number of fractionations, which may reduce the immune function, and the blood is being recognized as an organ at risk. Recently, a randomized phase II trial comparing two types of target definition in radiotherapy for glioblastomas was conducted, and it was reported that the overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly better in a small irradiation field group. We review recent findings on the immune response and the immunotherapy to glioblastomas and the novel role of radiotherapy and propose the need to develop an optimal radiotherapy that takes radiation effects on the immune function into account.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37071249
"""Enhanced targeting of invasive glioblastoma cells by peptide-functionalized gold nanorods in hydrogel-based 3D cultures.""","""Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in several cancer types, making their eradication a primary objective in cancer therapy. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) tumors are usually composed of a highly infiltrating CSC subpopulation, which has Nestin as a putative marker. Since the majority of these infiltrating cells are able to elude conventional therapies, we have developed gold nanorods (AuNRs) functionalized with an engineered peptide capable of specific recognition and selective eradication of Nestin positive infiltrating GBM-CSCs. These AuNRs generate heat when irradiated by a near-infrared laser, and cause localized cell damage. Nanoparticle internalization assays performed with GBM-CSCs or Nestin negative cells cultured as two-dimensional (2D) monolayers or embedded in three-dimensional (3D) biodegradable-hydrogels of tunable mechanical properties, revealed that the AuNRs were mainly internalized by GBM-CSCs, and not by Nestin negative cells. The AuNRs were taken up via energy-dependent and caveolae-mediated endocytic mechanisms, and were localized inside endosomes. Photothermal treatments resulted in the selective elimination of GBM-CSCs through cell apoptosis, while Nestin negative cells remained viable. Results also indicated that GBM-CSCs embedded in hydrogels were more resistant to AuNR photothermal treatments than when cultured as 2D monolayers. In summary, the combination of our engineered AuNRs with our tunable hydrogel system has shown the potential to provide an in vitro platform for the evaluation and screening of AuNR-based cancer therapeutics, leading to a substantial advancement in the application of AuNRs for targeted GBM-CSC therapy. Statement of significance: There is an urgent need for reliable and efficient therapies for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), which is currently an untreatable brain tumor form with a very poor patient survival rate. GBM tumors are mostly comprised of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor reoccurrence and therapy resistance. We have developed gold nanorods functionalized with an engineered peptide capable of selective recognition and eradication of GBM-CSCs via heat generation by nanorods upon NIR irradiation. An in vitro evaluation of nanorod therapeutic activities was performed in 3D synthetic-biodegradable hydrogel models with distinct biomechanical cues, and compared to 2D cultures. Results indicated that cells cultured in 3D were more resistant to photothermolysis than in 2D systems.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28576716
"""Hurdles in radiation planning for glioblastoma: Can delayed-contrast enhanced computed tomography be a potential solution?""","""Objective: Conformal radiation is the standard of care in treatment of glioblastoma. Although co-registration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with early contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is recommended for target delineation by consensus guidelines, ground realities in developing countries often result in availability of less-than-ideal MR sequences for treatment planning. Purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of incorporation of delayed-CECT sequences for radiation planning in glioblastomas, as an adjunct or alternative to MRI. Methods: Case records of all patients of glioblastoma treated at our center between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Gross treatment volumes were delineated on T1 contrast MRI (m-GTV), early CECT (e-GTV) and delayed CECT (d-GTV); volumetric comparisons were made using repeated measures analysis of variance and pair-wise analysis. Results: Although 96% of registered patients underwent postoperative MRI, only 38% of them had desirable sequences suitable for co-registration. Median duration between acquisition of postoperative MRI and surgery was 45 days (range, 33-60), whereas that between MRI and treatment-planning CT was 5 days (range, 1-10). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001) were obtained between mean volumes of e-GTV (41.20cc), d-GTV (58.09cc) and m-GTV (60.52cc). Although the mean GTV increased by 46% between early CECT and MRI, the difference was only 4% between delayed CECT and MRI. Conclusion: Delayed CECT is superior to early CECT for co-registration with MRI for target delineation, especially when available MR sequences are less-than-ideal for treatment planning, and can be considered as the most appropriate adjunct as well as an alternative to MRI, compared to early CECT.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30698349
"""Study protocol for a multicenter randomised controlled trial on the (cost)effectiveness of biopsy combined with same-session MR-guided LITT versus biopsy alone in patients with primary irresectable glioblastoma (EMITT trial).""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary, malignant brain tumour with a 5-year survival of 5%. If possible, a glioblastoma is resected and further treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRT), but resection is not feasible in about 30% of cases. Current standard of care in these cases is a biopsy followed by CRT. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has been suggested as a minimally invasive alternative when surgery is not feasible. However, high-quality evidence directly comparing LITT with standard of care is lacking, precluding any conclusions on (cost-)effectiveness. We therefore propose a multicenter randomized controlled study to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of MR-guided LITT as compared to current standard of care (EMITT trial). Methods and analysis: The EMITT trial will be a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands. Seven Dutch hospitals will participate in this study. In total 238 patients will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to receive either biopsy combined with same-session MR-guided LITT therapy followed by CRT or the current standard of care being biopsy followed by CRT. The primary outcomes will be health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) (non-inferiority) using EORTC QLQ-C30 + BN20 scores at 5 months after randomization and overall survival (superiority). Secondary outcomes comprise cost-effectiveness (healthcare and societal perspective) and HR-QoL of life over an 18-month time horizon, progression free survival, tumour response, disease specific survival, longitudinal effects, effects on adjuvant treatment, ablation percentage and complication rates. Discussion: The EMITT trial will be the first RCT on the effectiveness of LITT in patients with glioblastoma as compared with current standard of care. Together with the Dutch Brain Tumour Patient association, we hypothesize that LITT may improve overall survival without substantially affecting patients' quality of life.

"""Zika virus and brain cancer: Can Zika be an effective treatment for brain cancer? A systematic review.""","""Introduction: Many studies have highlighted the use of oncolytic viruses as a new class of therapeutic agents for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, especially glioblastomas (GMB). Zika Virus (ZIKV) proteins targeted to specific stem cells have been studied in vitro and animal models with promising results. Materials and methods: A systematic review was evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ZIKV use for CNS tumors treatment. Data were extracted and the in vivo studies were evaluated using the Robins-I tool. We assessed bias in each study using criteria such as selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and others. According to Cochrane guidelines, bias was classified as high, low, or uncertain. High bias occurred when studies did not meet the criteria. Low bias was assigned when criteria were clearly met. Uncertain bias reflected insufficient information for a clear classification. Results: The 14 included studies shown that ZIKV reduced cell viability or inhibited the growth, proliferation of glioma stem cells (GSCs), and Bcl2 expression - which could potentially enhance the effect of chemotherapy/radiotherapy; caused cytopathic effects, induced tumor cell damage, manifested oncolytic properties, and even selectively safely killed GSCs; ultimately, it led to significant tumor remission and enhanced long-term survival through enhanced T-cell response. Conclusions: Although current evidence suggests ZIKV as a promising treatment for CNS tumors and may improve survival when combined with surgery and radiotherapy. Despite limited human evidence, it shows potential benefits. Further research is needed to confirm safety, efficacy, and optimize treatment in humans.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39347716

In the pediatric population, this treatment strategy often delays radiotherapy and may improve the outcome in patients. This manuscript describes the use of a preradiation chemotherapy approach for adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The main objective of this trial was to determine the feasibility of delivering up to 3 monthly cycles of a 72 h continuous simultaneous intravenous infusion of BCNU (40 mg/m2/day) and cisplatin (40 mg/m2/day). Patients were evaluated for tumor response or progression after each cycle. Following the completion of the chemotherapy treatments or evidence of tumor progression, patients underwent external beam radiotherapy. A dose of 45 Gy was delivered to the pretreatment tumor volume plus surrounding edema and a margin of 3.0 cm. An additional 14.4 Gy was delivered to the preoperative volume plus a 2 cm margin. Fifty patients were enrolled, 47 were eligible and analyzable. Overall, 79% of patients were able to complete at least 2 cycles of treatment, exceeding the predefined measure of feasibility. One patient achieved a complete response, 10 patients a partial response and 18 patients had stable disease at completion of the chemotherapy treatments. Twenty-four patients experienced grade 4 toxicity, mostly hematologic. All patients were able to undergo radiotherapy following chemotherapy. These results indicate that a preradiation strategy is feasible. Although responses to the chemotherapy were seen, a phase III trial is needed to determine whether this approach provides an advantage over standard treatment; such a phase III trial has been undertaken by ECOG.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10982156
"""Dosimetric evaluation and treatment planning considerations for GammaTile permanent brain implants - a pilot, institutional experience.""","""Purpose: GammaTile® (GT) is a brachytherapy platform that received Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval as brain tumor therapy in late 2018. Here, we reviewed our institutional experience with GT as treatment for recurrent glioblastomas and characterized dosimetric parameter and associated clinical outcome. Methods and materials: A total of 20 consecutive patients with 21 (n = 21) diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma underwent resection followed by intraoperative GT implant between 01/2019 and 12/2020. Data on gross tumor volume (GTV), number of GT units implanted, dose coverage for the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), measured by D90 or dose received by 90% of the HR-CTV, dose to organs at risk, and six months local control were collected. Results: The median D90 to HR-CTV was 56.0 Gy (31.7-98.7 Gy). The brainstem, optic chiasm, ipsilateral optic nerve, and ipsilateral hippocampus median Dmax were 11.2, 5.4, 6.4, and 10.0 Gy, respectively. None of the patients in this study cohort suffered from radiation necrosis or adverse events attributable to the GT. Correlation was found between pre-op GTV, the volume of the resection cavity, and the number of GT units implanted. Of the resection cavities, 7/21 (33%) of the cavity experienced shrinkage, 3/21 (14%) remained stable, and 11/21 (52%) of the cavities expanded on the 3-months post-resection/GT implant MRIs. D90 to HR-CTV was found to be associated with local recurrence at 6-month post GT implant, suggesting a dose response relationship (p = 0.026). The median local recurrence-free survival was 366.5 days (64-1,098 days), and a trend towards improved local recurrence-free survival was seen in patients with D90 to HR-CTV ≥ 56 Gy (p = 0.048).

"""MRI in Glioma Immunotherapy: Evidence, Pitfalls, and Perspectives.""","""Pseudophenomena, that is, imaging alterations due to therapy rather than tumor evolution, have an important impact on the management of glioma patients and the results of clinical trials. RANO (response assessment in neurooncology) criteria, including conventional MRI (cMRI), addressed the issues of pseudoprogression after radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy and pseudoresponse during antiangiogenic therapy of glioblastomas (GBM) and other gliomas. The development of cancer immunotherapy forced the identification of further relevant response criteria, summarized by the iRANO working group in 2015. In spite of this, the unequivocal definition of glioma progression by cMRI remains difficult particularly in the setting of immunotherapy approaches provided by checkpoint inhibitors and dendritic cells.

The laser was adapted for use with a repurposed stereotactic surgery frame utilizing a micro laser probe and Hamilton syringe. The authors designed and manufactured a stereotactic frame attachment to work as a temperature probe stabilizer. Application of this novel design was used as a precise method for real-time thermometry at known distances from the thermal ablative center mass during murine LITT studies. Results: Temperature measurements were achieved during LITT that verified the direct thermometry capability of the system without the need for MR-based thermal monitoring. Application of multiple stereotactic design iterations led to an accurately reproducible surgical laser ablation procedure. Histological staining confirmed precise thermal ablation and controllable lesion size based on time and temperature control. Treatment of a syngeneic intracranial glioma model highly resistant to conventional therapy resulted in a modest survival benefit.

"""MGMT methylation status: the advent of stratified therapy in glioblastoma?""","""Glioblastomas are the most malignant gliomas with median survival times of only 15 months despite modern therapies. All standard treatments are palliative. Pathogenetic factors are diverse, hence, stratified treatment plans are warranted considering the molecular heterogeneity among these tumors. However, most patients are treated with 'one fits all' standard therapies, many of them with minor response and major toxicities. The integration of clinical and molecular information, now becoming available using new tools such as gene arrays, proteomics, and molecular imaging, will take us to an era where more targeted and effective treatments may be implemented. A first step towards the design of such therapies is the identification of relevant molecular mechanisms driving the aggressive biological behavior of glioblastoma. The accumulation of diverse aberrations in regulatory processes enables tumor cells to bypass the effects of most classical therapies available. Molecular alterations underlying such mechanisms comprise aberrations on the genetic level, such as point mutations of distinct genes, or amplifications and deletions, while others result from epigenetic modifications such as aberrant methylation of CpG islands in the regulatory sequence of genes. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene encoding a DNA repair enzyme was recently found to be of predictive value in a randomized clinical trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma testing the addition of the alkylating agent temozolomide to standard radiotherapy. Determination of the methylation status of the MGMT promoter may become the first molecular diagnostic tool to identify patients most likely to respond that will allow individually tailored therapy in glioblastoma. To date, the test for the MGMT-methylation status is the only tool available that may direct the choice for alkylating agents in glioblastoma patients, but many others may hopefully become part of an arsenal to stratify patients to respective targeted therapies within the next years.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17325429

"""Molecular advances of brain tumors in radiation oncology.""","""Glioblastoma, grade IV malignant glioma based on the World Health Organization classification, is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. The average survival time of less than 1 year has not improved notably over the last 3 decades. Surgery and radiotherapy, the traditional cornerstones of therapy, provide palliative benefit, whereas the value of chemotherapy has been marginal and controversial. The dismal prognosis of glioblastoma patients is largely caused by the striking radioresistance of these tumors. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the malignant phenotype of glioblastomas and plausible mechanisms of radiation resistance can provide new possibilities in terms of targeted therapeutic strategies. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of malignant gliomas, common aberrations in the signaling elements of the growth and survival pathways are found.

Undergoing a gross total resection, receiving postoperative adjuvant therapy and having low p53 protein expression were factors that independently contributed to longer overall survival times in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide significantly prolonged overall survival times and was well tolerated in elderly patients with glioblastomas. In addition, low p53 protein expression was a significant favorable prognostic indicator in this population.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27485530
"""Emerging immunotherapies for malignant glioma: from immunogenomics to cell therapy.""","""As immunotherapy assumes a central role in the management of many cancers, ongoing work is directed at understanding whether immune-based treatments will be successful in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Despite several large studies conducted in the last several years, there remain no FDA-approved immunotherapies in this patient population. Nevertheless, there are a range of exciting new approaches being applied to GBM, all of which may not only allow us to develop new treatments but also help us understand fundamental features of the immune response in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize new developments in the application of immune checkpoint blockade, from biomarker-driven patient selection to the timing of treatment. Moreover, we summarize novel work in personalized immune-oncology by reviewing work in cancer immunogenomics-driven neoantigen vaccine studies. Finally, we discuss cell therapy efforts by reviewing the current state of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32615600
"""Applying a Radiation Therapy Volume Analysis Pipeline to Determine the Utility of Spectroscopic MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma.""","""Accurate radiation therapy (RT) targeting is crucial for glioblastoma treatment but may be challenging using clinical imaging alone due to the infiltrative nature of glioblastomas. Precise targeting by whole-brain spectroscopic MRI, which maps tumor metabolites including choline (Cho) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), can quantify early treatment-induced molecular changes that other traditional modalities cannot measure. We developed a pipeline to determine how spectroscopic MRI changes during early RT are associated with patient outcomes to provide insight into the utility of adaptive RT planning. Data were obtained from a study (NCT03137888) where glioblastoma patients received high-dose RT guided by the pre-RT Cho/NAA twice normal (Cho/NAA ≥ 2x) volume, and received spectroscopic MRI scans pre- and mid-RT. Overlap statistics between pre- and mid-RT scans were used to quantify metabolic activity changes after two weeks of RT. Log-rank tests were used to quantify the relationship between imaging metrics and patient overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS). Patients with lower Jaccard/Dice coefficients had longer PFS (p = 0.045 for both), and patients with lower Jaccard/Dice coefficients had higher OS trending towards significance (p = 0.060 for both). Cho/NAA ≥ 2x volumes changed significantly during early RT, putting healthy tissue at risk of irradiation, and warranting further study into using adaptive RT planning.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37218946
"""Evaluation of Proton-Induced DNA Damage in 3D-Engineered Glioblastoma Microenvironments.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating cancer of the brain with an extremely poor prognosis. For this reason, besides clinical and preclinical studies, novel in vitro models for the assessment of cancer response to drugs and radiation are being developed. In such context, three-dimensional (3D)-engineered cellular microenvironments, compared to unrealistic two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell culture, provide a model closer to the in vivo configuration. Concerning cancer treatment, while X-ray radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the current standard, proton beam therapy is an appealing alternative as protons can be efficiently targeted to destroy cancer cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. However, despite the treatment's compelling biological and medical rationale, little is known about the effects of protons on GBM at the cellular level. In this work, we designed novel 3D-engineered scaffolds inspired by the geometry of brain blood vessels, which cover a vital role in the colonization mechanisms of GBM cells. The architectures were fabricated by two-photon polymerization (2PP), cultured with U-251 GBM cells and integrated for the first time in the context of proton radiation experiments to assess their response to treatment. We employed Gamma H2A.X as a fluorescent biomarker to identify the DNA damage induced in the cells by proton beams. The results show a higher DNA double-strand breakage in 2D cell monolayers as compared to cells cultured in 3D. The discrepancy in terms of proton radiation response could indicate a difference in the radioresistance of the GBM cells or in the rate of repair kinetics between 2D cell monolayers and 3D cell networks. Thus, these biomimetic-engineered 3D scaffolds pave the way for the realization of a benchmark tool that can be used to routinely assess the effects of proton therapy on 3D GBM cell networks and other types of cancer cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442634

"""The Role of Myeloid Cells in GBM Immunosuppression.""","""Gliomas are intrinsic brain tumors that originate from glial cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive glioma type and resistant to immunotherapy, mainly due to its unique immune environment. Dimensional data analysis reveals that the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of immune cell populations in the glioma microenvironment is largely made up of cells of myeloid lineage. Conventional therapies of combined surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have achieved limited improvements in the prognosis of glioma patients, as myeloid cells are prominent mediators of immune and therapeutic responses-like immunotherapy resistance-in glioma. Myeloid cells are frequently seen in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and they are polarized to promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. Reprogramming myeloid cells has emerged as revolutionary, new types of immunotherapies for glioma treatment. Here we detail the current advances in classifying epigenetic, metabolic, and phenotypic characteristics and functions of different populations of myeloid cells in glioma TME, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), glioma-associated neutrophils (GANs), and glioma-associated dendritic cells (GADCs), as well as the mechanisms underlying promotion of tumorigenesis.

Unfortunately, increasing age is one of the most important negative prognostic factors for gliomas, and the optimal management of this population remains largely unsettled because older patients are often excluded from clinical trials. However, the former nihilistic approach is progressively changing towards more active strategies. Indeed prospective randomized studies have recently established the benefit of radiotherapy and the validity of an accelerated course of irradiation in older patients suffering from malignant gliomas. The interest of debulking surgery remains still unknown in this population, and the interest of chemotherapy, alone or concomitant with radiotherapy is still under evaluation. Symptomatic treatments such as corticosteroids and antiepileptic drugs may be less tolerated in the elderly compared to younger patients and should be used only if requered. Initial performance status, quality of life and concomitant pathologies are obviously important factors to consider before treatment onset. The willingness of the patient and his caregivers will also be a key for the therapeutic decision. In the future, specific schedules of treatment in the elderly should be developed, and prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to improve the pattern of care of malignant gliomas in this population.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21586383

"""Immunogenic Cell Death Induced by Chemoradiotherapy of Novel pH-Sensitive Cargo-Loaded Polymersomes in Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Inducing the immunogenic cell death of tumour cells can mediate the occurrence of antitumour immune responses and make the therapeutic effect more significant. Therefore, the development of treatments that can induce ICD to destroy tumour cells most effectively is promising. Previously, a new type of pH-sensitive polymersome was designed for the treatment of glioblastoma which represents a promising nanoplatform for future translational research in glioblastoma therapy. In this study, the aim of this work was to analyse whether chemoradiotherapy of the novel pH-sensitive cargo-loaded polymersomes can induce ICD. Methods: Cell death in U87-MG and G422 cells was induced by Au-DOX@PO-ANG, and cell death was analysed by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The release of CRT was determined by using laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. ELISA kits were used to detect the release of HMGB1 and ATP. The dying cancer cells treated with different treatments were cocultured with bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and then flow cytometry was used to determine the maturation rate of BMDCs (CD11c+CD86+CD80+) to analyse the in vitro immunogenicity. Tumour vaccination experiments were used to evaluate the ability of Au-DOX@PO-ANG to induce ICD in vivo. Results: We determined the optimal treatment strategy to evaluate the ability of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy to induce ICD and dying cancer cells induced by Au-DOX@PO-ANG+RT could induce calreticulin eversion to the cell membrane, promote the release of HMGB1 and ATP, and induce the maturation of BMDCs. Using dying cancer cells induced by Au-DOX@PO-ANG+RT, we demonstrate the efficient vaccination potential of ICD in vivo. Conclusion: These results identify Au-DOX@PO-ANG as a novel immunogenic cell death inducer in vitro and in vivo that could be effectively combined with RT in cancer therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34712045

Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapy is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy in the treatment of glioblastomas, since these cells can select and lyse therapy-resistant glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLCs). Immunotherapy with super-charged NK cells has a potential as antitumor approach since we found their efficiency to kill patient-derived GSLCs in 2D and 3D models, potentially reversing the immunosuppression also seen in the patients. In addition to their potent cytotoxicity, NK cells secrete IFN-γ, upregulate GSLC surface expression of CD54 and MHC class I and increase sensitivity of GSLCs to chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, NK cell localization in peri-vascular regions in glioblastoma tissues and their close contact with GSLCs in tumorospheres suggests their ability to infiltrate glioblastoma tumors and target GSLCs.

In one direction, endothelial cells and their secreted proteins are able to sustain GSC properties while, in turn, GSCs can promote neoangiogenesis, modulate endothelial cell functions and may even transdifferentiate into endothelial cells. Accordingly, targeting tumor vasculature seems a promising issue despite incomplete and transient results obtained from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapeutic trials. Recent findings of novel GSC-secreted molecules with pro-angiogenic properties (Semaphorin 3A, hepatoma-derived growth factor) open the path to the design of a concerted attack of glioblastoma vasculature that could overcome the development of resistance to single-targeted therapies while keeping away the toxicity of the treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23229792

We infected different GBM cell lines with JEV-LAV to investigate whether it had growth inhibitory effects on GBM cell lines in vitro. We used two models for evaluating the effect of JEV-LAV on GBM growth in mice. We investigated the antitumor immune mechanism of JEV-LAV through flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We explored the possibility of combining JEV-LAV with PD-L1 blocking therapy. This work suggested that JEV-LAV had oncolytic activity against GBM tumor cells in vitro and inhibited their growth in vivo. Mechanistically, JEV-LAV increased CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumor tissues and remodeled the immunosuppressive GBM microenvironment that is non-conducive to immunotherapy. Consequently, the results of combining JEV-LAV with immune checkpoint inhibitors indicated that JEV-LAV therapy improved the response of aPD-L1 blockade therapy against GBM.

Furthermore, literature on the utilization of healthcare and life-sustaining interventions during the late-stage of glioblastoma has been limited. Aim: To identify and compare healthcare utilization and life-sustaining interventions between patients with glioblastoma who received palliative care and who did not based on patients identified retrospectively from Taiwan Cancer Registry between January 2007 and December 2017. Design: In this study, palliative care was defined on the basis of claims submitted to the National Health Insurance, which has a specific code for it. Variables included demographic characteristics, the utilization of healthcare services, and invasive life-sustaining interventions. Setting/participants: Of the 1994 patients with glioblastoma identified, 1784 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 613 (34%) of whom received palliative care. Results: The survival of patients with glioblastoma under palliative care was significantly longer than that of those without palliative care. Those without palliative care had significantly more frequent intensive care unit admissions and a longer cumulative length of intensive care unit stay. Regarding cardiopulmonary or respiratory treatments, patients without palliative care had significantly more invasive interventions than those with palliative care. Patients receiving palliative care had significantly lower odds than those without life-sustaining interventions. Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis reveals that glioblastoma patients without palliative care had greater odds of receiving life-sustaining treatments within 1 year before their death, although no gains in survival as compared to those that received palliative care.

"""Glioblastomas: Hijacking Metabolism to Build a Flexible Shield for Therapy Resistance.""","""Significance: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most lethal tumors despite the almost exclusive localization to the brain. This is largely due to therapeutic resistance. Radiation and chemotherapy significantly increase the survival for GBM patients, however, GBMs always recur, and the median overall survival is just over a year. Proposed reasons for such intractable resistance to therapy are numerous and include tumor metabolism, in particular, the ability of tumor cells to reconfigure metabolic fluxes on demand (metabolic plasticity). Understanding how the hard-wired, oncogene-driven metabolic tendencies of GBMs intersect with flexible, context-induced metabolic rewiring promises to reveal novel approaches for combating therapy resistance. Recent Advances: Personalized genome-scale metabolic flux models have recently provided evidence that metabolic flexibility promotes radiation resistance in cancer and identified tumor redox metabolism as a major predictor for resistance to radiation therapy (RT). It was demonstrated that radioresistant tumors, including GBM, reroute metabolic fluxes to boost the levels of reducing factors of the cell, thus enhancing clearance of reactive oxygen species that are generated during RT and promoting survival. Critical Issues: The current body of knowledge from published studies strongly supports the notion that robust metabolic plasticity can act as a (flexible) shield against the cytotoxic effects of standard GBM therapies, thus driving therapy resistance. The limited understanding of the critical drivers of such metabolic plasticity hampers the rational design of effective combination therapies. Future Directions: Identifying and targeting regulators of metabolic plasticity, rather than specific metabolic pathways, in combination with standard-of-care treatments have the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

"""The Multifaceted Glioblastoma: From Genomic Alterations to Metabolic Adaptations.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) develops on glial cells and is the most common as well as the deadliest form of brain cancer. As in other cancers, distinct combinations of genetic alterations in GBM subtypes induce a diversity of metabolic phenotypes, which explains the variability of GBM sensitivity to current therapies targeting its reprogrammed metabolism. Therefore, it is becoming imperative for cancer researchers to account for the temporal and spatial heterogeneity within this cancer type before making generalized conclusions about a particular treatment's efficacy. Standard therapies for GBM have shown little success as the disease is almost always lethal; however, researchers are making progress and learning how to combine therapeutic strategies most effectively. GBMs can be classified initially into two subsets consisting of primary and secondary GBMs, and this categorization stems from cancer development. GBM is the highest grade of gliomas, which includes glioma I (low proliferative potential), glioma II (low proliferative potential with some capacity for infiltration and recurrence), glioma III (evidence of malignancy), and glioma IV (GBM) (malignant with features of necrosis and microvascular proliferation). Secondary GBM develops from a low-grade glioma to an advanced-stage cancer, while primary GBM provides no signs of progression and is identified as an advanced-stage glioma from the onset.

"""[Neutron capture therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Initial experience in the Czech Republic].""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its treatment remains unsatisfactory with very limited overall survival. In the year 2001, in cooperation with Department of Neurosurgery, Nemocnice Na Homolce and Nuclear Research Institute in Rez, we have started to treat glioblastoma patients with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Methods and results: Cells of malignant brain tumors, especially that of glioblastomas, are able to accumulate boron compounds. If BNCT should be successful, it is necessary to reach selective accumulation of sufficient amount of 10B in the tumor and low accumulation in the normal brain tissue. After BSH administration, radiation with low energy thermal neutrons is delivered. It results in nuclear capture and fission reactions with subsequent selective damage of tumor cells. At the time of analysis 9 patients have been enrolled. Therapy was completed in 5 patients. Treatment has been very well tolerated. We observed minimal acute toxicity associated with radiation and no laboratory abnormalities after administrations of BSH. Unfortunately treatment results were quite unsatisfactory. The median time to progression and overall survival were shorter then expected with conventional treatment. Conclusions: BNCT is very well tolerated with only a modest toxicity. In contrast to standard radiation, BNCT patients receive only one dose of radiation. Nevertheless, in this small pilot study first results were inferior when compared either to outcomes of conventional therapy or to results reported from other BNCT groups. It might be explained that lower dose of radiation had been used. Further study will show whether the higher dose radiation can improve treatment results.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15061119

"""Bioengineered Bacteriophage-Like Nanoparticles as RNAi Therapeutics to Enhance Radiotherapy against Glioblastomas.""","""Since glioblastomas (GBMs) are radioresistant malignancies and most GBM recurrences occur in radiotherapy, increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy by gene-silencing has recently attracted attention. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and RNA loading in nanoparticles leads to batch-to-batch variations of the RNA therapeutics, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Here, we bioengineer bacteriophage Qβ particles with a designed broccoli light-up three-way junction (b-3WJ) RNA scaffold (contains two siRNA/miRNA sequences and one light-up aptamer) packaging for the silencing of genes in radioresistant GBM cells. The in vitro results demonstrate that the cleavage of de novo designed b-3WJ RNA by Dicer enzyme can be easily monitored in real-time using fluorescence microscopy, and the TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR successfully knocks down EGFR and IKKα simultaneously and thereby inactivates NF-κB signaling to inhibit DNA repair. Delivery of TrQβ@b-3WJLet-7gsiEGFR through convection-enhanced delivery (CED) infusion followed by 2Gy X-ray irradiation demonstrated that the median survival was prolonged to over 60 days compared with the 2Gy X-ray irradiated group (median survival: 31 days). Altogether, the results of this study could be critical for the design of RNAi-based genetic therapeutics, and CED infusion serves as a powerful delivery system for promoting radiotherapy against GBMs without evidence of systemic toxicity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120837

"""Migration of mesenchymal stem cells towards glioblastoma cells depends on hepatocyte-growth factor and is enhanced by aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic treatment.""","""Hepatocyte-growth factor (HGF) is expressed by glioblastomas and contributes to their growth, migration and invasion. HGF also mediates migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to sites of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, MSC show tropism for glioblastomas, which is exploited in gene therapy to deliver the therapeutics to the tumor cells. Here, we have studied whether HGF contributes to the recruitment of MSC by glioblastoma cells and whether aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (ALA/PDT), a novel therapeutic approach that induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, affects HGF release and this migratory response. MSC expressed the HGF receptor MET and migrated towards U87 and U251 glioblastoma spheroids. Migration increased significantly when spheroids were subjected to ALA/PDT, which was associated with induction of apoptosis and up-regulation of HGF. Neutralizing HGF resulted in significant inhibition of MSC migration towards untreated as well as ALA/PDT-treated spheroids. Thus, glioblastoma cells express HGF, which contributes to the attraction of MSC. ALA/PDT induces apoptosis and augments HGF release causing enhanced MSC migration towards the tumor cells. ALA/PDT may therefore be exploited to improve targeting of MSC delivered gene therapy, but it may also constitute a risk in terms of beneficial effects for the tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333382

"""Joint Optimization of Photon-Carbon Ion Treatments for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Carbon ions are radiobiologically more effective than photons and are beneficial for treating radioresistant gross tumor volumes (GTV). However, owing to a reduced fractionation effect, they may be disadvantageous for treating infiltrative tumors, in which healthy tissue inside the clinical target volume (CTV) must be protected through fractionation. This work addresses the question: What is the ideal combined photon-carbon ion fluence distribution for treating infiltrative tumors given a specific fraction allocation between photons and carbon ions? Methods and materials: We present a method to simultaneously optimize sequentially delivered intensity modulated photon (IMRT) and carbon ion (CIRT) treatments based on cumulative biological effect, incorporating both the variable relative biological effect of carbon ions and the fractionation effect within the linear quadratic model. The method is demonstrated for 6 glioblastoma patients in comparison with the current clinical standard of independently optimized CIRT-IMRT plans. Results: Compared with the reference plan, joint optimization strategies yield inhomogeneous photon and carbon ion dose distributions that cumulatively deliver a homogeneous biological effect distribution. In the optimal distributions, the dose to CTV is mostly delivered by photons and carbon ions are restricted to the GTV with variations depending on tumor size and location. Improvements in conformity of high-dose regions are reflected by a mean EQD2 reduction of 3.29 ± 1.22 Gy in a dose fall-off margin around the CTV. Carbon ions may deliver higher doses to the center of the GTV, and photon contributions are increased at interfaces with CTV and critical structures. This results in a mean EQD2 reduction of 8.3 ± 2.28 Gy, in which the brain stem abuts the target volumes. Conclusions: We have developed a biophysical model to optimize combined photon-carbon ion treatments. For 6 glioblastoma patient cases, we show that our approach results in a more targeted application of carbon ions that (1) reduces dose in normal tissues within the target volume, which can only be protected through fractionation; and (2) boosts central target volume regions to reduce integral dose. Joint optimization of IMRT-CIRT treatments enable the exploration of a new spectrum of plans that can better address physical and radiobiological treatment planning challenges.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34058258

Recent progress in the nanomedicine field suggests that the targeting of nanoparticles to immune cells can be used to modulate the immune response and enhance therapeutic delivery to the diseased tissue. In the presence of tumor lesions, monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) expand significantly in the bone marrow, egress into peripheral blood, and traffic to the solid tumor, where they help maintain an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the interaction between PAMAM dendrimers and M-MDSCs in two murine models of glioblastoma, by examining the cell-level biodistribution kinetics of the systemically injected dendrimers. We found that M-MDSCs in the tumor and lymphoid organs can efficiently endocytose hydroxyl dendrimers. Interestingly, the trafficking of M-MDSCs from the bone marrow to the tumor contributed to the deposition of hydroxyl dendrimers in the tumor. M-MDSCs showed different capacities of endocytosing dendrimers of different functionalities in vivo.

"""Use of a neural network-based prediction method to calculate the therapeutic dose in boron neutron capture therapy of patients with glioblastoma.""","""Background: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a binary radiotherapy based on the 10 B(n, α)7 Li capture reaction. Nonradioactive isotope 10 B atoms which selectively concentrated in tumor cells will react with low energy neutrons (mainly thermal neutrons) to produce secondary particles with high linear energy transfer, thus depositing dose in tumor cells. In clinical practice, an appropriate treatment plan needs to be set on the basis of the treatment planning system (TPS). Existing BNCT TPSs usually use the Monte Carlo method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) therapeutic dose distribution, which often requires a lot of calculation time due to the complexity of simulating neutron transportation. Purpose: A neural network-based BNCT dose prediction method is proposed to achieve the rapid and accurate acquisition of BNCT 3D therapeutic dose distribution for patients with glioblastoma to solve the time-consuming problem of BNCT dose calculation in clinic. Methods: The clinical data of 122 patients with glioblastoma are collected. Eighteen patients are used as a test set, and the rest are used as a training set. The 3D-UNET is constructed through the design optimization of input and output data sets based on radiation field information and patient CT information to enable the prediction of 3D dose distribution of BNCT. Results: The average mean absolute error of the predicted and simulated equivalent doses of each organ are all less than 1 Gy. For the dose to 95% of the GTV volume (D95 ), the relative deviation between predicted and simulated results are all less than 2%. The average 2 mm/2% gamma index is 89.67%, and the average 3 mm/3% gamma index is 96.78%. The calculation takes about 6 h to simulate the 3D therapeutic dose distribution of a patient with glioblastoma by Monte Carlo method using Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4, whereas the time required by the method proposed in this study is almost less than 1 s using a Titan-V graphics card. Conclusions: This study proposes a 3D dose prediction method based on 3D-UNET architecture in BNCT, and the feasibility of this method is demonstrated. Results indicate that the method can remarkably reduce the time required for calculation and ensure the accuracy of the predicted 3D therapeutic dose-effect.

"""Combining cytotoxic and immune-mediated gene therapy to treat brain tumors.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is a type of intracranial brain tumor, for which there is no cure. In spite of advances in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients die within a year of diagnosis. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel therapeutic approaches for this disease. Gene therapy, which is the use of genes or other nucleic acids as drugs, is a powerful new treatment strategy which can be developed to treat GBM. Several treatment modalities are amenable for gene therapy implementation, e.g. conditional cytotoxic approaches, targeted delivery of toxins into the tumor mass, immune stimulatory strategies, and these will all be the focus of this review. Both conditional cytotoxicity and targeted toxin mediated tumor death, are aimed at eliminating an established tumor mass and preventing further growth. Tumors employ several defensive strategies that suppress and inhibit anti-tumor immune responses. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in eliciting anti-tumor immune responses has identified promising targets for immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is designed to aid the immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells in order to eliminate the tumor burden. Also, immune-therapeutic strategies have the added advantage that an activated immune system has the capability of recognizing tumor cells at distant sites from the primary tumor, therefore targeting metastasis distant from the primary tumor locale. Pre-clinical models and clinical trials have demonstrated that in spite of their location within the central nervous system (CNS), a tissue described as 'immune privileged', brain tumors can be effectively targeted by the activated immune system following various immunotherapeutic strategies. This review will highlight recent advances in brain tumor immunotherapy, with particular emphasis on advances made using gene therapy strategies, as well as reviewing other novel therapies that can be used in combination with immunotherapy. Another important aspect of implementing gene therapy in the clinical arena is to be able to image the targeting of the therapeutics to the tumors, treatment effectiveness and progression of disease. We have therefore reviewed the most exciting non-invasive, in vivo imaging techniques which can be used in combination with gene therapy to monitor therapeutic efficacy over time.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16248789
"""[Radiotherapy for glioblastomas: from radiobiology to concomitant chemotherapy].""","""The prognosis of glioblastoma remains extremely poor. Clinical research has been very active for thirty years, and has explored all the concepts developed in the laboratories of radiobiology. Radiosensitisation of hypoxic tumours, hyperfractioned radiotherapy, external beam radiotherapy plus stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy boost, and intensity modulated radiation therapy failed to improve the results of the treatment of these patients. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has just obtained a new success in the treatment of glioblastoma. The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit with minimal acute additional toxicity. The challenge remains to improve clinical outcomes further, and some new research pathways are open.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16095943
"""Integrating machine learning and bioinformatics analysis to m6A regulator-mediated methylation modification models for predicting glioblastoma patients' prognosis and immunotherapy response.""","""Background: Epigenetic regulations of immune responses are essential for cancer development and growth. As a critical step, comprehensive and rigorous explorations of m6A methylation are important to determine its prognostic significance, tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration characteristics and underlying relationship with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: To evaluate m6A modification patterns in GBM, we conducted unsupervised clustering to determine the expression levels of GBM-related m6A regulatory factors and performed differential analysis to obtain m6A-related genes. Consistent clustering was used to generate m6A regulators cluster A and B. Machine learning algorithms were implemented for identifying TME features and predicting the response of GBM patients receiving immunotherapy. Results: It is found that the m6A regulatory factor significantly regulates the mutation of GBM and TME. Based on Europe, America, and China data, we established m6Ascore through the m6A model. The model accurately predicted the results of 1206 GBM patients from the discovery cohort. Additionally, a high m6A score was associated with poor prognoses. Significant TME features were found among the different m6A score groups, which demonstrated positive correlations with biological functions (i.e., EMT2) and immune checkpoints. Conclusions: m6A modification was important to characterize the tumorigenesis and TME infiltration in GBM. The m6Ascore provided GBM patients with valuable and accurate prognosis and prediction of clinical response to various treatment modalities, which could be useful to guide patient treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244287
"""Predictive and prognostic markers in human glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most aggressive of all known human tumors. The median survival times remain in the 12- to 15-month range despite aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Through molecular and genetic profiling efforts, underlying mechanisms of resistance to these therapies are becoming better understood. The present standard of care has been shaped by the recently reported phase III study by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Cancer Institute of Canada, which found that the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to radiation therapy significantly improved outcome compared with radiation alone. However, careful examination of these data reveals that not all GBM patients benefited from the addition of TMZ to radiation therapy. A companion correlative study found that GBM patients with tumors with MGMT promoter methylation appeared to derive the greatest benefit from the addition of TMZ to radiation therapy. Although this finding is provocative, it should be kept in mind that this study was performed retrospectively and that prospective validation is required before MGMT methylation can be used for clinical stratification purposes. However, this study does show promise for the tailoring of future treatments according to the molecular and genetic profiles of an individual's tumor rather than using the 'one-glove-fits-all' approach that is currently being followed. As more effective 'smart drugs' are developed, molecular and genetic profiling will assume even greater importance in this regard.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032561

"""Treatment of malignant astrocytomas with recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-SAM2).""","""We present our experience with a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of ranimustine (MCNU) and recombinant human mutant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-SAM2) for malignant astrocytomas. The initial regimens were prescribed as adjuvant therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment. Newly diagnosed patients were treated with up to four cycles of this regimen (TNF-SAM2, MCNU, and radiotherapy: TMR group). Seventeen patients (11 men and 6 women) aged 24 to 68 years (median 54.6 years) were eligible and evaluated for response and toxicity. The estimated median survival time was 354 weeks with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 76 weeks with glioblastomas. One- and 2-year survival rates were 100% and 100% with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 69.2% and 29.7% with glioblastomas. Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities were not experienced. None of the patients experienced a treatment delay due to toxicity. All other acute toxicities were anticipated and manageable. Twenty three patients (11 men and 12 women) aged 22 to 66 years (median 50.7 years) were evaluated as a historical control of patients who received chemotherapy with MCNU alone in conjunction with radiotherapy following standard surgical treatment (MCNU and radiotherapy: MR group). The estimated median survival time was 205 weeks with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 62 weeks with glioblastomas. One- and 2-year survival rates were 88.9% and 66.7% with anaplastic astrocytomas, and 71.4% and 7.1% with glioblastomas in this group. There were no significant differences in survival rates between patients in the TMR and MR groups with either anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. However, despite the small number of patients, those with anaplastic astrocytoma in the TMR group tended to survive longer than those in the MR group. These results suggest that combined chemotherapy with mutant TNF-alpha may benefit those with anaplastic astrocytoma, and thus warrants further evaluation. On the other hand, the lack of activity does not warrant any further study of this schedule of TNF-SAM2 for the treatment of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9854511

"""Survival signalling and apoptosis resistance in glioblastomas: opportunities for targeted therapeutics.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults and one of the most aggressive cancers in man. Despite technological advances in surgical management, combined regimens of radiotherapy with new generation chemotherapy, the median survival for these patients is 14.6 months. This is largely due to a highly deregulated tumour genome with opportunistic deletion of tumour suppressor genes, amplification and/or mutational hyper-activation of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors. The net result of these genetic changes is augmented survival pathways and systematic defects in the apoptosis signalling machinery. The only randomised, controlled phase II trial conducted targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling with the small molecule inhibitor, erlotinib, has showed no therapeutic benefit. Survival signalling and apoptosis resistance in GBMs can be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Targeting increased survival is unlikely to be efficacious without at the same time targeting apoptosis resistance. We have critically reviewed the literature regarding survival and apoptosis signalling in GBM, and highlighted experimental, preclinical and recent clinical trials attempting to target these pathways. Combined therapies simultaneously targeting apoptosis and survival signalling defects might shift the balance from tumour growth stasis to cytotoxic therapeutic responses that might be associated with greater therapeutic benefits.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515495

"""Hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) versus conventional fractionated radiation therapy (CRT) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. A propensity score matched analysis.""","""Background: The current treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consists of surgery followed by conventional radiotherapy (CRT) with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) has been investigated and it resulted feasible and safe. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HFRT can be comparable to CRT. Materials and methods: The analysis included newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with CRT 60 Gy/30 fractions or HFRT 60 Gy/15 fractions. A propensity score matching analysis (PSM) was performed using a logistic regression that considered age, KPS, extent of surgery, MGMT and IDH status. Results: A total of 267 patients were included; before PSM 169 were in CRT-group and 98 in HRFT-group. After 1:1 matching, 82 patients resulted in each group. The median OS time was 17.9 months for the CRT-group and 16.7 months for the HFRT-group; the 1, 2, 3-year OS rates were 75.6%, 32.7%, and 15.5% for the CRT-group, and 75.6%, 33.3%, and 18.9% for the HFRT-group (p value = 0.8).

"""Concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for 'biopsy-only' glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: Combined temozolomide and radiotherapy (RT) is the standard postoperative therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the clearest benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) observed in clinical trials has been among patients who undergo surgical resection. Whether the improved survival with CRT extends to patients who undergo 'biopsy only' is less certain. The authors compared overall survival (OS) in a national cohort of patients with GBM who underwent biopsy and received either RT alone or CRT during the temozolomide era. Methods: The US National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients with histologically confirmed, biopsy-only GBM who received either RT alone or CRT from 2006 through 2011. Demographic and clinicopathologic predictors of treatment were analyzed using the chi-square test, the t test, and multivariable logistic regression. OS was evaluated using the log-rank test, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and propensity score-matched analysis. Results: In total, 1479 patients with biopsy-only GBM were included, among whom 154 (10.4%) received RT alone and 1325 (89.6%) received CRT. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years. CRT was associated with a significant OS benefit compared with RT alone (median, 9.2 vs 5.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.76; P < .001). CRT was independently associated with improved OS compared with RT alone on multivariable analysis (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85; P < .001). A significant OS benefit for CRT persisted in a propensity score-matched analysis (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93; P = .009). Conclusions: The current data suggest that CRT significantly improves OS in patients with GBM who undergo biopsy only compared with RT alone and should remain the standard of care for patients who can tolerate therapy.

"""Application of blood brain barrier models in pre-clinical assessment of glioblastoma-targeting CAR-T based immunotherapies.""","""Human blood brain barrier (BBB) models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become an important tool for the discovery and preclinical evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) targeting cell and gene-based therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a revolutionary form of gene-modified cell-based immunotherapy with potential for targeting solid tumors, such as glioblastomas. Crossing the BBB is an important step in the systemic application of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of glioblastomas and other CNS malignancies. In addition, even CAR-T therapies targeting non-CNS antigens, such as the well-known CD19-CAR-T therapies, are known to trigger CNS side-effects including brain swelling due to BBB disruption. In this study, we used iPSC-derived brain endothelial-like cell (iBEC) transwell co-culture model to assess BBB extravasation of CAR-T based immunotherapies targeting U87MG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells overexpressing the tumor-specific mutated protein EGFRvIII (U87vIII). Two types of anti-EGFRvIII targeting CAR-T cells, with varying tonic signaling profiles (CAR-F263 and CAR-F269), and control Mock T cells were applied on the luminal side of BBB model in vitro. CAR-F263 and CAR-F269 T cells triggered a decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and an increase in BBB permeability. CAR-T cell extravasation and U87vIII cytotoxicity were assessed from the abluminal compartment using flow cytometry and Incucyte real-time viability imaging, respectively. A significant decrease in U87vIII cell viability was observed over 48 h, with the most robust cytotoxicity response observed for the constitutively activated CAR-F263. CAR-F269 T cells showed a similar cytotoxic profile but were approximately four fold less efficient at killing the U87vIII cells compared to CAR-F263, despite similar transmigration rates. Visualization of CAR-T cell extravasation across the BBB was further confirmed using BBTB-on-CHIP models. The described BBB assay was able to discriminate the cytotoxic efficacies of different EGFRvIII-CARs and provide a measure of potential alterations to BBB integrity. Collectively, we illustrate how BBB models in vitro can be a valuable tool in deciphering the mechanisms of CAR-T-induced BBB disruption, accompanying toxicity and effector function on post-barrier target cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35650594

"""Oligonucleotide Therapeutics as a New Class of Drugs for Malignant Brain Tumors: Targeting mRNAs, Regulatory RNAs, Mutations, Combinations, and Beyond.""","""Malignant brain tumors are rapidly progressive and often fatal owing to resistance to therapies and based on their complex biology, heterogeneity, and isolation from systemic circulation. Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor, has high mortality, and affects both children and adults. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathology, multiple clinical trials employing various treatment strategies have failed. With much expanded knowledge of the GBM genome, epigenome, and transcriptome, the field of neuro-oncology is getting closer to achieve breakthrough-targeted molecular therapies. Current developments of oligonucleotide chemistries for CNS applications make this new class of drugs very attractive for targeting molecular pathways dysregulated in brain tumors and are anticipated to vastly expand the spectrum of currently targetable molecules. In this chapter, we will overview the molecular landscape of malignant gliomas and explore the most prominent molecular targets (mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and genomic mutations) that provide opportunities for the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics for this class of neurologic diseases. Because malignant brain tumors focally disrupt the blood-brain barrier, this class of diseases might be also more susceptible to systemic treatments with oligonucleotides than other neurologic disorders and, thus, present an entry point for the oligonucleotide therapeutics to the CNS. Nevertheless, delivery of oligonucleotides remains a crucial part of the treatment strategy. Finally, synthetic gRNAs guiding CRISPR-Cas9 editing technologies have a tremendous potential to further expand the applications of oligonucleotide therapeutics and take them beyond RNA targeting.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30644073

These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable 'patient tumor's phenocopy' that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23333277
"""Effect of duty cycles of tumor-treating fields on glioblastoma cells and normal brain organoids.""","""Tumor‑treating fields (TTFields) are emerging cancer therapies based on alternating low‑intensity electric fields that interfere with dividing cells and induce cancer cell apoptosis. However, to date, there is limited knowledge of their effects on normal cells, as well as the effects of different duty cycles on outcomes. The present study evaluated the effects of TTFields with different duty cycles on glioma spheroid cells and normal brain organoids. A customized TTFields system was developed to perform in vitro experiments with varying duty cycles. Three duty cycles were applied to three types of glioma spheroid cells and brain organoids. The efficacy and safety of the TTFields were evaluated by analyzing the cell cycle of glioma cells, and markers of neural stem cells (NSCs) and astrocytes in brain organoids. The application of the TTFields at the 75 and 100% duty cycle markedly inhibited the proliferation of the U87 and U373 compared with the control. FACS analysis revealed that the higher the duty cycle of the applied fields, the greater the increase in apoptosis detected. Exposure to a higher duty cycle resulted in a greater decrease in NSC markers and a greater increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in normal brain organoids. These results suggest that TTFields at the 75 and 100% duty cycle induced cancer cell death, and that the neurotoxicity of the TTFields at 75% was less prominent than that at 100%. Although clinical studies with endpoints related to safety and efficacy need to be performed before this strategy may be adopted clinically, the findings of the present study provide meaningful evidence for the further advancement of TTFields in the treatment of various types of cancer.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970698

Cancer cells (cell line: HeLa and Huh7) and fibroblasts (cell line: HEL299) were cultured in an in-house-developed cell culture device embedded with stimulating electrodes. A low-intensity alternating electric field was applied to the culture. The field significantly induced proliferation arrest of the cancer cells, while had limited influence on the fibroblasts. Moreover, in combination with the anti-cancer drug, damage to the cancer cells was enhanced by the electric field. Thus, a lower dosage of the drug could be applied to achieve the same treatment effectiveness.

METHODS The authors describe their experience, in which SLA for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment was performed entirely within a conventional MRI suite using the SmartFrame stereotactic device. RESULTS All 10 patients with GBM (2 with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation [mIDH1] and 8 with wild-type IDH1 [wtIDH1]) were followed for > 6 months. One of these patients underwent 2 independent SLAs approximately 12 months apart. Biopsies were performed prior to SLA for all patients. There were no perioperative morbidities, wound infections, or unplanned 30-day readmissions. The average time for a 3-trajectory SLA (n = 3) was 436 ± 102 minutes; for a 2-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 321 ± 85 minutes; and for a single-trajectory SLA (n = 4) was 254 ± 28 minutes. No tumor recurrence occurred within the blue isotherm line ablation zone, although 2 patients experienced recurrence immediately adjacent to the blue isotherm ablation line. Overall survival for the patient cohort averaged 356 days, with the 2 patients who had mIDH1 GBMs exhibiting the longest survival (811 and 654 days).

"""Sustained localized delivery of immunotherapy to lymph nodes reverses immunosuppression and increases long-term survival in murine glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Despite the advent of immunotherapy as a promising therapeutic, glioblastoma (GBM) remains resistant to using checkpoint blockade due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor milieu. Moreover, current anti-PD-1 treatment requires multiple infusions with adverse systemic effects. Therefore, we used a PCL:PEG:PCL polymer gel loaded with anti-PD-1 and implanted at the site of lymph nodes in an attempt to maximize targeting of inactivated T cells as well as mitigate unnecessary systemic exposure. Methods: Mice orthotopically implanted with GL261 glioma cells were injected with hydrogels loaded with anti-PD-1 in one of the following locations: cervical lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, and the tumor site. Mice treated systemically with anti-PD-1 were used as comparative controls. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for all arms, with ex vivo flow cytometric staining for L/D, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, TNF-α and IFN-y and co-culture ELISpots were done for immune cell activation assays. Results: Mice implanted with PCL:PEG:PCL hydrogels carrying anti-PD-1 at the site of their lymph nodes showed significantly improved survival outcomes compared to mice systemically treated with anti-PD-1 (P = .0185). Flow cytometric analysis of brain tissue and co-culture of lymph node T cells from mice implanted with gels demonstrated increased levels of IFN-y and TNF-α compared to mice treated with systemic anti-PD-1, indicating greater reversal of immunosuppression compared to systemic treatment. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate proof of principle for using localized therapy that targets lymph nodes for GBM. We propose an alternative treatment paradigm for developing new sustained local treatments with immunotherapy that are able to eliminate the need for multiple systemic infusions and their off-target effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290904
"""Determining a cut-off residual tumor volume threshold for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy: A multicenter cohort study.""","""Standard-of-care treatment of glioblastomas involves maximal safe resection and adjuvant temozolomide chemo-radiotherapy. Although extent of resection (EOR) is a well-known surgical predictor for overall survival most lesions cannot be completely resected. We hypothesize that in the event of incomplete resection, residual tumor volume (RTV) may be a more significant predictor than EOR. This was a multicenter retrospective review of 147 adult glioblastoma patients (mean age 53 years) that underwent standard treatment. Semiautomatic magnetic resonance imaging segmentation was performed for pre- and postoperative scans for volumetric analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for prognostic factors including: age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, EOR and RTV. EOR and RTV cut-off values for improved OS were determined and internally validated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for 12-month overall survival. Half of the tumors had MGMT promoter methylation (77, 52%). The median tumor volume, EOR and RTV were 43.20 cc, 93.5%, and 3.80 cc respectively. Gross total resection was achieved in 52 patients (35%). Cox proportional hazards regression, ROC and maximum Youden index analyses for RTV and EOR showed that a cut-off value of <3.50 cc (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48-0.98) and ≥84% (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.96) respectively conferred an overall survival advantage.

"""Comparison of linear accelerator and helical tomotherapy plans for glioblastoma multiforme patients.""","""Background: Despite advances in radiotherapy, overall survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients is still poor. Moreover dosimetrical analyses with these newer treatment methods are insufficient. The current study is aimed to compare intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) linear accelerator (linac) and helical tomotherapy (HT) treatment plans for patients with prognostic aggressive brain tumors. Material and methods: A total of 20 GBM patient plans were prospectively evaluated in both linac and HT planning systems. Plans are compared with respect to homogenity index, conformity index and organs at risk (OAR) sparing effects of the treatments. Results: Both treatment plans provided good results that can be applied to GBM patients but it was concluded that if the critical organs with relatively lower dose constraints are closer to the target region, HT for radiotherapeutical application could be preferred. Conclusion: Tomotherapy plans were superior to linear accelerator plans from the aspect of OAR sparing with slightly broader low dose ranges over the healthy tissues. In case a clinic has both of these IMRT systems, employment of HT is recommended based on the observed results and future re-irradiation strategies must be considered.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25292068
"""Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme with prior radiation therapy.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) carries a poor prognosis with high recurrence rates. Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be an effective treatment option. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients (41 lesions) treated with salvage SRS for recurrent GBM between 2004 and 2012. Initial surgical treatments were gross total resection (58%), subtotal resection (STR) (24%), and biopsy (18%). All patients were treated with prior radiation therapy. Recurrent disease was treated with salvage SRS with a median dose and fractions of 23.4 Gy (range, 12-30) and 3 (range, 1-3), respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted to establish predictive factors (P ≤ 0.05) Results: Median follow-up from salvage SRS was 10.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-15.6). The median time from initial radiation therapy to salvage SRS was 13.7 months (IQR, 2.9-25.0). The 6- and 12-month overall survival from salvage SRS were 84.9% and 42.5%, respectively. On univariate analysis, STR was associated with inferior survival from salvage SRS (P ≤ 0.05). The 6- and 12-month local control (LC) estimates were 63.1% and 16.4%, respectively. On univariate analysis, higher biological effective dose and prior temozolomide were associated with superior LC. Concerning toxicity, there were 4 (12%) grade 2 and 1 (3%) grade 3 adverse events within this patient series. No grade 4 or grade 5 toxicities were observed. Conclusion: Our outcomes suggest that SRS is a feasible treatment option with acceptable salvage survival rates, given the poor prognosis of this disease.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28169234
"""Intra-operative radiation therapy for malignant brain tumors: rationale, method, and treatment results of cerebral glioblastomas.""","""In radiation therapy for malignant brain tumours, the dose of radiation that can be safely delivered to a tumour is limited by the radiation tolerance of the adjacent normal brain tissue. Among various radiation modalities to produce local tumour eradication without unacceptable complications, we chose a large, single irradiation dose during the operation (intra-operative radiation therapy, IORT). In contrast to X-ray or Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, IORT with a high-energy electron beam delivered by the Shimadzu 20 MeV betatron provides acceptable dose homogeneity with rapid fall-off of the radiation dose beyond the treatment volume. Thus, IORT has the advantage of precise demarcation of the target volume, minimum damage to surrounding normal tissues, and a high absorbed target dose (15-25 Gy in 5-10 min). On the basis of our experience with 170 patients treated by IORT, we established the treatment indications and method in patients with malignant brain tumours. IORT with a dose of 15-25 Gy was delivered to widely resected tumours followed by external radiation therapy. No acute or subacute complications were observed. Treatment results of 30 patients with glioblastoma treated by IORT (mean 18.3 Gy) combined with external radiation therapy (mean 58.5 Gy) resulted in a median survival of 119 weeks and a 2-year survival rate of 61%.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7709789
"""Early MRI changes in glioblastoma in the period between surgery and adjuvant therapy.""","""To investigate the increase in MRI contrast enhancement (CE) occurring in glioblastoma during the period between surgery and initiation of chemo-radiotherapy, thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were analyzed by early post-operative magnetic resonance (EPMR) imaging within three days of surgery and by pre-adjuvant magnetic resonance (PAMR) examination before adjuvant therapy. Areas of new CE were investigated by use of EPMR diffusion-weighted imaging and PAMR perfusion imaging (by arterial spin-labeling). PAMR was acquired, on average, 29.9 days later than EPMR (range 20-37 days). During this period an increased area of CE was observed for 17/37 patients. For 3/17 patients these regions were confined to areas of reduced EPMR diffusion, suggesting postsurgical infarct. For the other 14/17 patients, these areas suggested progression. For 11/17 patients the co-occurrence of hyperperfusion in PAMR perfusion suggested progression. PAMR perfusion and EPMR diffusion did not give consistent results for 3/17 patients for whom small new areas of CE were observed, presumably because of the poor spatial resolution of perfusion imaging. Before initiation of adjuvant therapy, areas of new CE of resected glioblastomas are frequently observed. Most of these suggest tumor progression, according to EPMR diffusion and PAMR perfusion criteria.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23264191

"""Adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer suppresses growth of human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo.""","""Alterations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene occur in 35-60% of human glioblastomas, and re-introduction of p53 can suppress neoplastic growth. To evaluate the potential for p53 gene therapy of glioblastoma, we have analyzed the response of human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo to experimental therapy with replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type p53 (rAd-p53). Western blot analyses showed high-level expression of p53 protein after treatment with rAd-p53, and transgene expression was dependent on promoter strength. A p53-specific dose-dependent inhibition of in vitro cellular proliferation was observed in 5 of 6 cell lines, and growth inhibition corresponded to adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and expression. p53-specific cell death was quantitated by release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Fragmentation of DNA into nucleosomal oligomers and the occurrence of a hypodiploid cell population detected by flow cytometry provided evidence for apoptosis. Studies in nude mice demonstrated that ex vivo infection with rAd-p53 suppressed the tumorigenic potential of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, direct injection of rAd-p53 into established s.c. xenografts inhibited tumor growth. Our observations suggest that re-introduction of wild-type p53 may have potential clinical utility for gene therapy of glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8824552
"""Spatial optimization for radiation therapy of brain tumours.""","""Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumours. They are known for their highly aggressive growth and invasion, leading to short survival times. Treatments for glioblastomas commonly involve a combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (XRT). Previous works have not only successfully modelled the natural growth of glioblastomas in vivo, but also show potential for the prediction of response to radiation prior to treatment. This suggests that the efficacy of XRT can be optimized before treatment in order to yield longer survival times. However, while current efforts focus on optimal scheduling of radiotherapy treatment, they do not include a similarly sophisticated spatial optimization. In an effort to improve XRT, we present a method for the spatial optimization of radiation profiles. We expand upon previous results in the general problem and examine the more physically reasonable cases of 1-step and 2-step radiation profiles during the first and second XRT fractions. The results show that by including spatial optimization in XRT, while retaining a constant prescribed total dose amount, we are able to increase the total cell kill from the clinically-applied uniform case.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31251755

PubMed and Web of Science were searched for peer-reviewed articles pertaining to cases of glioblastomas / gliosarcomas with primary spinal origin, using predefined search terms. Furthermore we performed hand searches tracking the references from the selected papers. Eighty-two articles published between 1938 and March 2015 were eligible. They reported on 157 patients. Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The proportion of patients who received adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy clearly increased from the time before 1980 until present. Median overall survival from diagnosis was 8.0 ± 0.9 months. On univariate analysis age influenced overall survival, whereas tumor location, gender and the extent of initial resection did not. Outcomes did not differ between children (< 18 years) and adults. However, the patients who were treated after 1980 achieved longer survival times than the patients treated before. On multivariable analysis only age (< 60 years) and the time period of treatment (≥ 1980) were confirmed as positive independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, primary spinal GB / GS mainly affect younger patients and are associated with a dismal prognosis. However, most likely due to the increasing use of adjuvant treatment, modest therapeutic progress has been achieved over recent decades. The characteristics and treatments of primary spinal glioblastomas should be entered into a central registry in order to gain more information about the ideal treatment approach in the future.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26859136

"""The prognostic IDH1( R132 ) mutation is associated with reduced NADP+-dependent IDH activity in glioblastoma.""","""Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) occur at high frequency in gliomas and seem to be a prognostic factor for survival in glioblastoma patients. In our set of 98 glioblastoma patients, IDH1 ( R132 ) mutations were associated with improved survival of 1 year on average, after correcting for age and other variables with Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with IDH1 mutations were on average 17 years younger than patients without mutation. Mutated IDH1 has a gain of function to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate by NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, but it is unknown whether NADPH production in gliomas is affected by IDH1 mutations. We assessed the effect of IDH1 (R132 ) mutations on IDH-mediated NADPH production in glioblastomas in situ. Metabolic mapping and image analysis was applied to 51 glioblastoma samples of which 16 carried an IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. NADP+-dependent IDH activity was determined in comparison with activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and all other NADPH-producing dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The occurrence of IDH1 mutations correlated with approx. twofold diminished NADP+-dependent IDH activity, whereas activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and the other NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases was not affected in situ in glioblastoma. The total NADPH production capacity in glioblastoma was provided for 65% by IDH activity and the occurrence of IDH1 (R132 ) mutation reduced this capacity by 38%. It is concluded that NADPH production is hampered in glioblastoma with IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. Moreover, mutated IDH1 consumes rather than produces NADPH, thus likely lowering NADPH levels even further. The low NADPH levels may sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy, thus explaining the prolonged survival of patients with mutated glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20127344

In this study, we established a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelopepseudotyped semi-replication-competent retrovirus vector system (spRRV) which is composed of two transcomplementing replication-defective retroviral vectors termed MuLV-Gag-Pol and GaLV-Env. We found that the spRRV shows considerable improvement in efficiencies of gene transfer and spreading in both human glioblastoma cells and pre-established human glioblastoma mouse model compared with an sRRV system.

"""Quantifying Uncertainty and Robustness in a Biomathematical Model-Based Patient-Specific Response Metric for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness. A growing body of literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the proliferation-invasion model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, days gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Furthermore, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. Although promising, the original article did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric, leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. Methods: We harnessed the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: (1) image acquisition and (2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first used synthetic data to characterize what nonerror variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then considered the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Results: Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pretreatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort, there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression was over 80% reliable. Conclusion: Although additional validation must be performed, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758984
"""Location of subventricular zone recurrence and its radiation dose predicts survival in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors that frequently recur in the subventricular zone (SVZ) despite maximal treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate imaging patterns of subventricular progression and impact of recurrent subventricular tumor involvement and radiation dose to patient outcome. Retrospective review of 50 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and treated with surgery, radiation, and concurrent temozolomide from January 2012 to June 2013 was performed. Tumors were classified based on location, size, and cortical and subventricular zone involvement. Survival was compared based on recurrence type, distance from the initial enhancing tumor (local ≤ 2 cm, distant > 2 cm), and the radiation dose at the recurrence site. Progression of enhancing subventricular tumor was common at both local (58%) and distant (42%) sites. Median survival was better after local SVZ recurrence than distant SVZ recurrence (8.7 vs. 4.3 months, p = 0.04). Radiation doses at local SVZ recurrence sites recurrence averaged 57.0 ± 4.0 Gy compared to 44.7 ± 6.7 Gy at distant SVZ recurrence sites (p = 0.008). Distant subventricular progression at a site receiving ≤ 45 Gy predicted worse subsequent survival (p = 0.05). Glioblastomas frequently recurred in the subventricular zone, and patient survival was worse when enhancing tumor occurred at sites that received lower radiation doses. This recurrent disease may represent disease undertreated at the time of diagnosis, and further study is needed to determine if improved treatment strategies, such as including the subventricular zone in radiation fields, could improve clinical outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29546530

Common pharmacological therapies often can only manage symptoms and have limited efficacy. Intraparenchymal convection enhanced delivery (IP CED) is a neurosurgical technique for direct brain delivery of therapeutics. Currently, the main applications of IP CED are targeted chemotherapy for glioblastoma and gene therapy. While IP CED has advantages over systemic approaches, its benefits can be drastically reduced by inadequate coverage as low as 21% of target anatomy, excessive infusion durations greater than 2 hours, and off-target effects.

Intensive treatment targeting localized lesion is required to improve GBM outcome, but dose escalation using conventional methods is limited by healthy tissue tolerance. Helical Tomotherapy (HT) Dose Painting (DP) treatments were simulated to safely deliver high doses in the recurrent regions. Materials and methods: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) data from five recurrent GBM were retrospectively considered for planning. Hypo-fractionated (25-50Gy, 5 fractions) voxel-based prescriptions were opportunely converted to personalized structured-based dose maps to create DP plans with a commercial Treatment Planning System. Optimized plans were generated and analyzed in terms of plan conformity to dose prescription (Q0.90-1.10), tolerance of the healthy tissues (DMAX), and dosimetry accuracy of the deliverable plans (γ-index). Results: Only three of the five cases could receive a safe retreatment without violating the maximum critical organs dose constraints. The conformity of the simulated plans was between 40.9% and 79.9% (Q0.90-1.10), their delivery time was in the range of 38.3-63.6min, while the dosimetry showed γ-index of 82.4-92.4%. Conclusions: This study proved the ability of our method to simulate personalized, deliverable and dosimetrically accurate DPBN plans.

Results: We present human data showing that patients with 'REST Enhanced Malignancies' (REM) tumors present with a shorter disease free survival compared to non-REM gliomas. Importantly, REM tumors are refractory to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and patients fail to respond to this line of treatment.

"""Combined radiotherapy and concurrent tumor treating fields (TTFields) for glioblastoma: Dosimetric consequences on non-coplanar IMRT as initial results from a phase I trial.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is a rapidly proliferating tumor. Patients bear an inferior prognosis with a median survival time of 14-16 months. Proliferation and repopulation are a major resistance promoting factor for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Tumor-Treating-Fields (TTFields) are an antimitotic modality applying low-intensity (1-3 V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300 kHz) alternating electric-fields. More recently interference of TTFields with DNA-damage-repair and synergistic effects with radiotherapy were reported in the preclinical setting. This study aims at examining the dosimetric consequences of TTFields applied during the course of radiochemotherapy. Methods: Cone-beam-computed-tomography (CBCT)-data from the first seven patients of the PriCoTTF-phase-I-trial were used in a predefined way for dosimetric verification and dose-accumulation of the non-coplanar-intensity-modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT)-treatment-plans as well as geometric analysis of the transducer-arrays by which TTFields are applied throughout the course of treatment. Transducer-array-position and contours were obtained from the low-dose CBCT's routinely made for image-guidance. Material-composition of the electrodes was determined and a respective Hounsfield-unit was assigned to the electrodes. After 6D-fusion with the planning-CT, the dose-distribution was recalculated using a Boltzmann-equation-solver (Acuros XB) and a Monte-Carlo-dose-calculation-engine. Results: Overdosage in the scalp in comparison to the treatment plan without electrodes stayed below 8.5% of the prescribed dose in the first 2 mm below and also in deeper layers outside 1cm2 at highest dose as obtained from dose-volume-histogram comparisons. In the clinical target volume (CTV), underdosage was limited to 2.0% due to dose attenuation by the electrodes in terms of D95 and the effective-uniform-dose. Principal-component-analysis (PCA) showed that the first principal-position-component of the variation of repeated array-placement in the direction of the largest variations and the perpendicular second-component spanning a tangential plane on the skull had a standard deviation of 1.06 cm, 1.23 cm, 0.96 cm, and 1.11 cm for the frontal, occipital, left and right arrays for the first and 0.70 cm, 0.71 cm, 0.79 cm, and 0.68 cm, respectively for the second-principal-component. The variations did not differ from patient-to-patient (p > 0.8, Kruskal-Wallis-tests). This motion led to a diminution of the dosimetric effects of the electrodes. Conclusion: From a dosimetric point of view, dose deviations in the CTV due to transducer-arrays were not clinically significant in the first 7 patients and confirmed feasibility of combined adjuvant radiochemotherapy and concurrent TTFields.

"""Residual Tumor Volume, Cell Volume Fraction, and Tumor Cell Kill During Fractionated Chemoradiation Therapy of Human Glioblastoma using Quantitative Sodium MR Imaging.""","""Purpose: Spatial and temporal patterns of response of human glioblastoma to fractionated chemoradiation are described by changes in the bioscales of residual tumor volume (RTV), tumor cell volume fraction (CVF), and tumor cell kill (TCK), as derived from tissue sodium concentration (TSC) measured by quantitative sodium MRI at 3 Tesla. These near real-time patterns during treatment are compared with overall survival. Experimental design: Bioscales were mapped during fractionated chemoradiation therapy in patients with glioblastomas (n = 20) using TSC obtained from serial quantitative sodium MRI at 3 Tesla and a two-compartment model of tissue sodium distribution. The responses of these parameters in newly diagnosed human glioblastomas undergoing treatment were compared with time-to-disease progression and survival. Results: RTV following tumor resection showed decreased CVF due to disruption of normal cell packing by edema and infiltrating tumor cells. CVF showed either increases back toward normal as infiltrating tumor cells were killed, or decreases as cancer cells continued to infiltrate and extend tumor margins. These highly variable tumor responses showed no correlation with time-to-progression or overall survival. Conclusions: These bioscales indicate that fractionated chemoradiotherapy of glioblastomas produces variable responses with low cell killing efficiency. These parameters are sensitive to real-time changes within the treatment volume while remaining stable elsewhere, highlighting the potential to individualize therapy earlier in management, should alternative strategies be available.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30487127
"""Hyperthermic Laser Ablation of Recurrent Glioblastoma Leads to Temporary Disruption of the Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier.""","""Background: Poor central nervous system penetration of cytotoxic drugs due to the blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major limiting factor in the treatment of brain tumors. Most recurrent glioblastomas (GBM) occur within the peritumoral region. In this study, we describe a hyperthemic method to induce temporary disruption of the peritumoral BBB that can potentially be used to enhance drug delivery. Methods: Twenty patients with probable recurrent GBM were enrolled in this study. Fourteen patients were evaluable. MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy was applied to achieve both tumor cytoreduction and disruption of the peritumoral BBB. To determine the degree and timing of peritumoral BBB disruption, dynamic contrast-enhancement brain MRI was used to calculate the vascular transfer constant (Ktrans) in the peritumoral region as direct measures of BBB permeability before and after laser ablation. Serum levels of brain-specific enolase, also known as neuron-specific enolase, were also measured and used as an independent quantification of BBB disruption. Results: In all 14 evaluable patients, Ktrans levels peaked immediately post laser ablation, followed by a gradual decline over the following 4 weeks. Serum BSE concentrations increased shortly after laser ablation and peaked in 1-3 weeks before decreasing to baseline by 6 weeks. Conclusions: The data from our pilot research support that disruption of the peritumoral BBB was induced by hyperthemia with the peak of high permeability occurring within 1-2 weeks after laser ablation and resolving by 4-6 weeks. This provides a therapeutic window of opportunity during which delivery of BBB-impermeant therapeutic agents may be enhanced.

Methods: The French brain tumor database and the Club de Neuro-Oncologie of the Société Française de Neurochirurgie retrospectively identified adult patients with cerebellar glioblastoma diagnosed between 2003 and 2017. Diagnosis was confirmed by a centralized neuropathological review. Results: Data from 118 cerebellar glioblastoma patients were analyzed (mean age 55.9 years, 55.1% males). The clinical presentation associated raised intracranial pressure (50.8%), static cerebellar syndrome (68.6%), kinetic cerebellar syndrome (49.2%) and/or cranial nerve disorders (17.8%). Glioblastomas were hemispheric (55.9%), vermian (14.4%) or both (29.7%). Hydrocephalus was present in 49 patients (41.5%). Histologically, tumors corresponded either to IDH-wild-type or to K27-mutant glioblastomas. Surgery consisted of total (12.7%), subtotal (35.6%), partial resection (33.9%) or biopsy (17.8%). The postoperative Karnofsky performance status was improved, stable and worsened in 22.4%, 43.9% and 33.7% of patients, respectively. Progression-free and overall survivals reached 5.1 months and 9.1 months, respectively. Compared to other surgical strategies, total or subtotal resection improved the Karnofsky performance status (33.3% vs 12.5%, p < 0.001), prolonged progression-free and overall survivals (6.5 vs 4.3 months, p = 0.015 and 16.7 vs 6.2 months, p < 0.001, respectively) and had a comparable complication rate (40.4% vs 31.1%, p = 0.29). After total or subtotal resection, the functional outcomes were correlated with age (p = 0.004) and cerebellar hemispheric tumor location (p < 0.001) but not brainstem infiltration (p = 0.16).

"""Multiscale Selectivity and in vivo Biodistribution of NRP-1-Targeted Theranostic AGuIX Nanoparticles for PDT of Glioblastoma.""","""Background: Local recurrences of glioblastoma (GBM) after heavy standard treatments remain frequent and lead to a poor prognostic. Major challenges are the infiltrative part of the tumor tissue which is the ultimate cause of recurrence. The therapeutic arsenal faces the difficulty of eradicating this infiltrating part of the tumor tissue while increasing the targeting of tumor and endogenous stromal cells such as angiogenic endothelial cells. In this aim, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a transmembrane receptor mainly overexpressed by endothelial cells of the tumor vascular system and associated with malignancy, proliferation and migration of GBM, highlighted to be a relevant molecular target to promote the anti-vascular effect of photodynamic therapy (VTP). Methods: The multiscale selectivity was investigated for KDKPPR peptide moiety targeting NRP-1 and a porphyrin molecule as photosensitizer (PS), both grafted onto original AGuIX design nanoparticle. AGuIX nanoparticle, currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of brain metastases with radiotherapy, allows to achieve a real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an accumulation in the tumor area by EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect. Using surface-plasmon resonance (SPR), we evaluated the affinities of KDKPPR and scramble free peptides, and also peptides-conjugated AGuIX nanoparticles to recombinant rat and human NRP-1 proteins. For in vivo selectivity, we used a cranial window model and parametric maps obtained from T2*-weighted perfusion MRI analysis. Results: The photophysical characteristics of the PS and KDKPPR molecular affinity for recombinant human NRP-1 proteins were maintained after the functionalization of AGuIX nanoparticle with a dissociation constant of 4.7 μM determined by SPR assays. Cranial window model and parametric maps, both revealed a prolonged retention in the vascular system of human xenotransplanted GBM. Thanks to the fluorescence of porphyrin by non-invasive imaging and the concentration of gadolinium evaluated after extraction of organs, we checked the absence of nanoparticle in the brains of tumor-free animals and highlighted elimination by renal excretion and hepatic metabolism. Conclusion: Post-VTP follow-ups demonstrated promising tumor responses with a prolonged delay in tumor growth accompanied by a decrease in tumor metabolism.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223826

Using electronic medical records, all patients newly diagnosed with GBM between 2008 and 2016 at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital were retrospectively examined. The eligible criteria included the following: 1) craniotomy with surgical resection or biopsy, 2) completion of CCRT, 3) accessible baseline and/or follow-up complete blood count (CBC).

Several mono-target small molecule-inhibitors have been investigated as novel therapeutics, thus far with poor success. In this study we investigated the anticancer effects of SB747651A, a multi-target small-molecule inhibitor, in three well characterized patient-derived glioblastoma spheroid cultures and a murine orthotopic xenograft model. Concentrations of 5-10 µM SB747651A reduced cell proliferation, spheroid formation, migration and chemoresistance, while apoptotic cell death increased. Investigation of oncogenic kinase signaling showed decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR, CREB, GSK3 and GYS1 leading to altered glycogen metabolism and formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Expression levels of cancer stemness marker SOX2 were reduced in treated tumor cells and SB747651A treatment significantly prolonged survival of mice with intracranial glioblastoma xenografts, while no adverse effects were observed in vivo at doses of 25 mg/kg administered 5 days/week for 8 weeks. These findings suggest that SB747651A has anticancer effects in glioblastoma. The cancer-related pathophysiological mechanisms targeted by SB747651A are shared among many types of cancer; however, an in-depth clarification of the mechanisms of action in cancer cells is important before further potential application of SB747651A as an anticancer agent can be considered.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727611

However, the extent to which this change has improved overall survival (OS) of patients treated outside clinical trials remains to be determined. Methods: We compared the patterns of care and OS of all GBM patients diagnosed in 2004 (n=105) and in 2008 (n=130) in our center. Results: Younger patients (aged<70 years) diagnosed in 2008 received temozolomide radiochemotherapy as the initial treatment and bevacizumab at recurrence more frequently than those diagnosed in 2004 (69% vs 26% P<10(-4) and 41% vs 3%, P<10(-4), respectively).

Tumor and proliferation markers such as p53 and PCNA have been immunohistochemically defined and have been useful in other tumors in determining prognosis. Therefore, the authors studied the correlation of responsiveness to treatment, time to progression and survival with p53 and PCNA labeling indices in a pre-irradiation chemotherapy study of the glioblastoma multiforme. Methods: Immunohistopathology for labeling indices for p53 and PCNA using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the glioblastomas of 23 patients entered into a phase II ECOG trial of pre-irradiation chemotherapy were defined using the streptavidin-peroxidase technique with AEC chromogen. The labeling indices were correlated with response to treatment time to progression and overall survival. Most patients received three cycles of BCNU for three days over three months and cisplatin monthly for three days over three months prior to external beam irradiation. Results: There were no significant differences in treatment response, time to progression or overall survival in glioblastoma, patients with positive p53 labeling index (> 5%) versus a negative p53 labeling index (< or = 5%) or positive PCNA labeling (> 10%) versus a negative labeling index (< or = 10%) or any combination of P53 and PCNA labeling indices.

This study investigates the evolution of the tumour extent and evaluates the need for plan adaptation to ensure dose coverage of the target in glioblastoma patients. Materials and methods: The prospective study included 29 patients referred for 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at the time of treatment planning, at fraction 10, 20, 30, and three weeks after the end of radiotherapy. The gross tumour volume (GTV) was defined as the T1w contrast-enhanced region plus the surgical cavity on each MRI set. The relative GTV volume and the maximum distance (Dmax) of the extent of the actual GTV outside the original GTV were measured. Based on the location of the actual GTV during radiotherapy and the original planned dose, a prospective clinical decision was made whether to adapt the treatment. Results: Dose coverage of the GTV during radiotherapy was not compromised, and none of the radiotherapy plans was adapted. The median Dmax (range) was 5.7 (2.0-18.9) mm, 8.0 (2.0-27.4) mm, 8.0 (1.9-27.3) mm, and 8.9 (1.9-34.4) mm at fraction 10, 20, 30, and follow-up.

The median survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant type, is only 15 months after initial diagnosis and even less after tumor recurrence. Improvements of standard treatment including surgery and radio-chemotherapy have not lead to major improvements. Therefore, alternative therapeutics such as oncolytic viruses that specifically target and destroy cancer cells are under investigation. Preclinical data of oncolytic parvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) infection of glioma cells demonstrated strong cytotoxic and oncosuppressing effects, leading to a phase I/IIa trial of H-1PV in patients with recurrent GBM (ParvOryx01). ParvOryx01 is the first trial with a replication competent oncolytic virus in Germany. Methods: ParvOryx01 is an open, non-controlled, two groups, intra-group dose escalation, single center, phase I/IIa trial. 18 patients with recurrent GBM will be treated in 2 groups of 9 patients each. Treatment group 1 will first receive H-1PV by intratumoral injection and second by administration into the walls of the tumor cavity during tumor resection. In treatment group 2 the virus will initially be injected intravenously and afterwards, identical to group 1, into the surrounding brain tissue during tumor removal. Main eligibility criteria are: age of 18 years, unifocal recurrent GBM, amenable to complete or subtotal resection. Dose escalation will be based on the Continual Reassessment Method. The primary objective of the trial is local and systemic safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives are proof of concept (PoC) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) up to 6 months. Discussion: This is the first trial with H-1PV in patients with recurrent GBM. The risks for the participants appear well predictable and justified. Furthermore, ParvOryx01 will be the first assessment of combined intratumoral and intravenous application of an oncolytic virus. Due to its study design the trial will not only generate data on the local effect of H-1PV but it will also investigate the penetration of H-1PV into the tumor after systemic delivery and obtain safety data from systemic delivery possibly supporting clinical trials with H-1PV in other, non-CNS malignancies.

"""[Glioblastoma: clinical, radiological and biological prognostic factors].""","""The main prognostic factors of glioblastomas (GBM) are age, neurological and cognitive status, frontal tumor location, extent of surgical resection, adjuvant therapies received, presence of IDH1 mutations, and MGMT expression. Other molecular prognostic factors have been proposed, such as mutations of TP53 and PTEN, amplification of EGFR, and deletion of 10q, but their prognostic values remain controversial. MGMT promotor gene methylation is correlated with higher chemosensitivity and consequently is a good prognostic factor only in patients treated with chemotherapy. In the future, the gene expression profile will probably be a stronger prognostic factor than histological grade, but the most relevant gene clusters, whose expression may be correlated with survival, remain to be identified. Long survivors are characterized by younger age, better neurological status, and a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.

In recognition of the emerging role of molecular diagnostic approaches to glioma classification, the role of genetic profiles has been emphasized on, as in the distinct subtypes of glioma. Glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) may develop de novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from lower-grade astrocytomas (secondary glioblastomas) both glioblastomas show similar histological features. However, these subtypes of glioblastoma involve distinct disease entities that evolve through different genetic pathways and are likely to differ in prognosis and response to therapy. Oligodendroglioma is recognized as a particular subtype of gliomas that shows remarkable response to chemotherapy [procarbazine+CCNU+vincristine (PCV)], making their correct diagnosis important. However, the histological differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from diffuse astrocytoma could be highly subjective in cases without typical morphological features. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q is correlated with sensitivity to PCV chemotherapy with increased survival in anaplastic oligodendroglioma cases (WHO grade III). Similarly, combined LOH on 1p and 19q has been identified as a predictor of favorable overall survival in oligodendrogliomas. Additionally, the status of the O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase gene (O6-MGMT) is associated with resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). We have previously found methylation or expression mosaicism of O6-MGMT in gliomas, resulting in problems on tumor sampling and response to TMZ. An assessment of the O6-MGMT methylation mosaicism in heterogeneous glioma may provide a more accurate assessment for the response to TMZ.

Knowledge of growth rates and growth patterns is useful for understanding tumor biology and planning treatment logistics. Based on untreated human glioblastoma data collected in Trondheim, Norway, we first fit the average growth to a Gompertz curve, then find a best fitted white noise term for the growth rate variance. Combining these two fits, we obtain a new type of Gompertz diffusion dynamics, which is a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Newly collected untreated human glioblastoma data in Seattle, US, re-verify our model. Instead of growth curves predicted by deterministic models, our SDE model predicts a band with a center curve as the tumor size average and its width as the tumor size variance over time. Given the glioblastoma size in a patient, our model can predict the patient survival time with a prescribed probability. The survival time is approximately a normal random variable with simple formulas for its mean and variance in terms of tumor sizes. Our model can be applied to studies of tumor treatments.

We performed a volumetric study of early radiographic responses in nd-GBM treated with BEV. Methods: Twenty-two patients with unresectable nd-GBM treated with BEV during concurrent temozolomide radiotherapy were analyzed. An experienced neuroradiologist interpreted early responses on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images (GdT1WI). Volumetric changes were evaluated using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and GdT1WI according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. The results were categorized into improved (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or non-improved (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]) groups; outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: The volumetric GdT1WI improvement was a significant predictive factor for overall survival (OS) prolongation (p = 0.0093, median OS: 24.7 vs. 13.6 months); however, FLAIR and DWI images were not predictive. The threshold for the neuroradiologist's interpretation of improvement in GdT1WI was nearly 20% of volume reduction, which was lesser than 50%, the definition of PR applied in the RANO criteria. However, even less stringent neuroradiologist interpretation could successfully predict OS prolongation (improved vs. non-improved: p = 0.0067, median OS: 17.6 vs. 8.3 months). Significant impact of OS on the early response in volumetric GdT1WI was observed within the cut-off range of 20-50% (20%, p = 0.0315; 30%, p = 0.087; 40%, p = 0.0456).

During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. Significance: It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults.

"""INtraoperative photoDYnamic Therapy for GliOblastomas (INDYGO): Study Protocol for a Phase I Clinical Trial.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by marked proliferation, major infiltration, and poor prognosis. Despite current treatments, including surgery, radiation oncology, and chemotherapy, the overall median survival is 15 mo and the progression-free survival is 7 to 8 mo. Because of systematic relapse of the tumor, the improvement of local control remains an issue. In this context, photodynamic therapy (PDT) may offer a new treatment modality for GBM. Objective: To assess the feasibility of intraoperative PDT early after surgical resection of GBM without unacceptable and unexpected toxicities. Methods: The INDYGO clinical trial (INtraoperative photoDYnamic Therapy for GliOblastomas) treatment will be carried out in addition to the current standard of care (SOC) of glioblastoma: maximum resection surgery followed by concomitant radio-chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. PDT treatment will be delivered during surgery early, after the fluorescence-guided resection. Immunological responses and biomarkers will also be investigated during the follow-up. A total of 10 patients will be recruited during this study. Expected outcomes: Clinical follow-up after the SOC with PDT is expected to be similar (no significant difference) to the SOC alone. Discussion: This INDYGO trial assesses the feasibility of intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid PDT, a novel seamless approach to treat GBM. The technology is easily embeddable within the reference treatment at a low-incremental cost. The safety of this new treatment modality is a preliminary requirement before a multicenter randomized clinical trial can be further conducted to assess local control improvement by treating infiltrating and nonresected GBM cells.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30053213
"""Prediction of tumor recurrence and therapy monitoring using ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging.""","""Selection and design of individualized treatments remains a key goal in cancer therapeutics; prediction of response and tumor recurrence following a given therapy provides a basis for subsequent personalized treatment design. We demonstrate an approach towards this goal with the example of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as the treatment modality and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) as a non-invasive, response and disease recurrence monitor in a murine model of glioblastoma (GBM). PDT is a photochemistry-based, clinically-used technique that consumes oxygen to generate cytotoxic species, thus causing changes in blood oxygen saturation (StO2). We hypothesize that this change in StO2 can be a surrogate marker for predicting treatment efficacy and tumor recurrence. PAI is a technique that can provide a 3D atlas of tumor StO2 by measuring oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. We demonstrate that tumors responding to PDT undergo approximately 85% change in StO2 by 24-hrs post-therapy while there is no significant change in StO2 values in the non-responding group. Furthermore, the 3D tumor StO2 maps predicted whether a tumor was likely to regrow at a later time point post-therapy. Information on the likelihood of tumor regrowth that normally would have been available only upon actual regrowth (10-30 days post treatment) in a xenograft tumor model, was available within 24-hrs of treatment using PAI, thus making early intervention a possibility. Given the advances and push towards availability of PAI in the clinical settings, the results of this study encourage applicability of PAI as an important step to guide and monitor therapies (e.g. PDT, radiation, anti-angiogenic) involving a change in StO2.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25553116

MHT-heating performance of photobeads in viscous media have the same heat performances in water at magnetic field conditions of clinical use. Thanks to IR780, the photobeads are activated by infrared laser light within the first biological window (808 nm) with a significant enhancement of photo-stability of IR780 enabling the raise of the temperature at therapeutic values during multiple PTT cycles and showing unchanged optical features up to 8 days. Moreover, the photobeads fluorescent signal is preserved once internalized by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. Peculiarly, the photobeads are used as toxic agents to eradicate thermo-resistant GBM cells at mild heat, as low as 41 °C, with MHT and PTT both of clinical use. Indeed, a high U87 GBM cell mortality percentage is obtained only with dual MHT/PTT while each single treatment dose not provide the same cytotoxic effects.

"""Oncological patterns of care and outcomes for 265 elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in France.""","""The incidence of glioblastoma (GBM) has increased in patients aged 70 years or older, and will continue to grow. Elderly GBM patients have been excluded from most clinical trials; furthermore, optimal care management as well as benefit/risk ratio of GBM treatments are still being debated. This study describes oncological patterns of care, prognostic factors, and survival for patients ≥ 70 years in France. We identified patients over 70 with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed GBM on data previously published by the French Brain Tumor DataBase. We included 265 patients. Neurological deficits and mental status disorders were the most frequent symptoms. The surgery consisted of resection (RS n = 95) or biopsy (B n = 170); 98 patients did not have subsequent oncological treatment. After surgery, first-line treatment consisted of radiotherapy (RT n = 76), chemotherapy (CT n = 52), and concomitant radiochemotherapy (CRC n = 39). The median age at diagnosis was 76, 74, and 73 years, respectively, for the untreated, B + RT and/or CT, RS ± RT and/or CT groups. Median survival (in days, 95 % CI) with these main strategies, when analyzed according to surgical groups, was: B-CT n = 41, 199[155-280]; B-CRC n = 21, 318[166-480]; B-RT n = 37, 149[130-214]; RS-CT n = 11, 245[211-na]; RS-CRC n = 18, 372[349-593]; RS-RT n = 39, 269[218-343]. This population study for elderly GBM patients is one of the most important in Europe, and could be considered as a historical cohort to compare future treatments. Moreover, we can hypothesize that elderly patients (versus patients <70 years) are undertreated. Karnofsky performance status seems to be the most relevant clinical predictive factor, and RS and CRC have a positive impact on survival for elderly GBM patients in the general population, at least when feasible.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24526367
"""Radiation-Induced Targeted Nanoparticle-Based Gene Delivery for Brain Tumor Therapy.""","""Targeted therapy against the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade holds considerable promise for the treatment of different tumor types; however, little effect has been observed against gliomas thus far. Effective glioma therapy requires a delivery vehicle that can reach tumor cells in the central nervous system, with limited systemic side effect. In this study, we developed a cyclic peptide iRGD (CCRGDKGPDC)-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PD-L1 for combined targeted and immunotherapy against glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumors. Building on recent studies showing that radiation therapy alters tumors for enhanced nanotherapeutic delivery in tumor-associated macrophage-dependent fashion, we showed that low-dose radiation primes targeted SLN uptake into the brain tumor region, leading to enhanced downregulation of PD-L1 and EGFR. Bioluminescence imaging revealed that radiation therapy followed by systemic administration of targeted SLN leads to a significant decrease in glioblastoma growth and prolonged mouse survival. This study combines radiation therapy to prime the tumor for nanoparticle uptake along with the targeting effect of iRGD-conjugated nanoparticles to yield a straightforward but effective approach for combined EGFR inhibition and immunotherapy against glioblastomas, which can be extended to other aggressive tumor types.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30916923

The survival time after the diagnosis of the recurrence was 16 and 20 months, respectively, which is substantially (about four times) longer than the natural history of the disease would suggest. In conclusion, cytoreduction by laser irradiation may be a promising option for patients suffering from recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

The present study investigated the possibility that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, could enhance radiation sensitivity and influence proliferative recovery after irradiation in glioblastoma cells. Radiosensitivity was evaluated by clonogenic survival; apoptotic cell death was evaluated using flow cytometric analysis; proliferative recovery was monitored based on viable cell number subsequent to radiation-induced growth arrest; activation of p44/42 MAPK was based on phosphorylation of the protein. Glioblastoma cells pretreated with imatinib demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to radiation. Imatinib also delayed proliferative recovery in irradiated glioblastoma cells. Imatinib promoted suppression of p44/42 MAPK signaling both when added prior to and post-irradiation. Increased sensitivity to radiation and delayed proliferative recovery in irradiated glioblastoma cells exposed to imatinib may be a consequence of the capacity of imatinib to interfere with p44/42 MAPK kinase signaling. Imatinib may prove to have clinical utility as a neoadjuvant and adjuvant in the treatment of glioblastomas that receive radiation therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16820883

Laboratory investigation.""","""Object: The goal of this study was to develop an assay that makes possible the assessment of the glioma cell response to single-fraction high-dose Gamma Knife surgery. In this assay, the isolation of radioresistant cell subpopulations facilitates mechanistic studies of radioresistance. Methods: A tissue-equivalent paraffin phantom with an aperture capable of holding an Opticell cell culture cassette was developed for treatment with the Leksell Gamma Knife model C. A second apparatus, which the authors also created, uses the manufacturer-supplied polystyrene phantom, thereby allowing this assay to be performed in the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion. After treatment, the cells were morphologically assessed to determine their response to radiation treatment. Two specific parameters were used to determine radiosensitivity: 1) the diameter of the clearing zone, defined as the central region of cell death; and 2) the number of surviving colonies within this central high-dose clearing zone. Results: Radioresistance was compared in 2 different cell lines from glioblastomas. The first cell line, ME, was established from a primary tumor before its treatment, and the second cell line, DIV, was established from a tumor that recurred after treatment with chemotherapy and fractionated radiotherapy. The ME cell line had the most robust response to radiosurgery, as characterized by a consistently larger clearing zone (28.33 ± 1.1 mm). In contrast, the clearing zone produced when the DIV cell line was used was 24.0 ± 1 mm, indicating an approximate response difference of 5 Gy. The mean number of surviving colonies within the clearing zone for the ME cell line was 1.33 ± 1 compared with that for the DIV cell line, which was 66.67 ± 2. Conclusions: The authors developed a biological dosimeter to model the response of cells from glioblastomas to single-fraction high-dose radiation.

The focus was on understanding whether the interval between surgery and CCRT impacts survival outcomes. Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database ( https://opendata.hira.or.kr/ ) were collected to retrospectively review 3,586 patients diagnosed with GBM in South Korea between 2008 and 2021. Patients were divided into early CCRT (≤ 21 days between surgery and CCRT) and late CCRT (> 21 days between surgery and CCRT) groups and further categorised based on the type of surgery (biopsy alone or surgical resection). The study estimated overall survival (OS) and conducted univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 19.98 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 19.12-20.86 months). In univariable analysis, the late CCRT group demonstrated a longer median OS compared to the early CCRT group (20.47 vs. 17.94 months, P = 0.0002, log-rank test). However, this difference was not significant in multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.782-1.091, P = 0.6663). Subgroup analysis revealed that late CCRT was associated with prolonged OS in patients who underwent surgical resection (adjusted HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.752-0.955, P = 0.0065), whereas in the biopsy-alone group, late CCRT was associated with shorter OS (adjusted HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.378-2.346, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients who initiated CCRT more than 21 days post-resection demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) compared to those who began CCRT earlier. In contrast, among patients who underwent biopsy alone, initiating CCRT within 21 days was associated with better outcomes. These findings suggest that the optimal timing for CCRT initiation in GBM may depend on the extent of residual tumour.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39587516

We aimed to evaluate the significance of CatS in human astrocytoma progression and as a prognostic marker. Frozen tissue homogenates from 71 patients with astrocytomas and 3 normal brain specimens were subjected to ELISA analyses. Immunohistochemical analysis of CatS expression was performed on 126 paraffin-embedded tumour samples. Fifty-one astrocytoma cases were suitable for both frozen tissue and paraffin tissue analysis. ELISA revealed minimal expression of CatS in normal brain homogenates. CatS expression was increased in grade IV tumours whereas astrocytoma grades I-III exhibited lower values. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a similar pattern of expression. Moreover, high-CatS immunohistochemical scores in glioblastomas were associated with significantly shorter survival (10 vs. 5 months, p = 0.014). With forced inclusion of patient age, radiation dose and Karnofsky score in the Cox multivariate model, CatS score was found to be an independent predictor of survival. CatS expression in astrocytomas is associated with tumour progression and poor outcome in glioblastomas.

We analyzed the relapse patterns in FET-PET after a FET- and MRI-based integrated-boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of glioblastomas to perform an optimized target volume definition. Methods: A relapse pattern analysis was performed in 13 glioblastoma patients treated with radiochemotherapy within a prospective phase-II-study between 2008 and 2009. Radiotherapy was performed as an integrated-boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IB-IMRT). The prescribed dose was 72 Gy for the boost target volume, based on baseline FET-PET (FET-1) and 60 Gy for the MRI-based (MRI-1) standard target volume. The single doses were 2.4 and 2.0 Gy, respectively. Location and volume of recurrent tumors in FET-2 and MRI-2 were analyzed related to initial tumor, detected in baseline FET-1. Variable target volumes were created theoretically based on FET-1 to optimally cover recurrent tumor. Results: The tumor volume overlap in FET and MRI was poor both at baseline (median 12 %; range 0-32) and at time of recurrence (13 %; 0-100). Recurrent tumor volume in FET-2 was localized to 39 % (12-91) in the initial tumor volume (FET-1). Over the time a shrinking (mean 12 (5-26) ml) and shifting (mean 6 (1-10 mm) of the resection cavity was seen. A simulated target volume based on active tumor in FET-1 with an additional safety margin of 7 mm around the FET-1 volume covered recurrent FET tumor volume (FET-2) significantly better than a corresponding target volume based on contrast enhancement in MRI-1 with a same safety margin of 7 mm (100 % (54-100) versus 85 % (0-100); p < 0.01). A simulated planning target volume (PTV), based on FET-1 and additional 7 mm margin plus 5 mm margin for setup-uncertainties was significantly smaller than the conventional, MR-based PTV applied in this study (median 160 (112-297) ml versus 231 (117-386) ml, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In this small study recurrent tumor volume in FET-PET (FET-2) overlapped only to one third with the boost target volume, based on FET-1. The shrinking and shifting of the resection cavity may have an influence considering the limited overlap of initial and relapse tumor volume. A simulated target volume, based on FET-1 with 7 mm margin covered 100 % of relapse volume in median and led to a significantly reduced PTV, compared to MRI-based PTVs.

The clinicopathologic features of these 26 cases, including actuarial survival times, were compared with the remaining 1453 GBM. The minimal qualitative and quantitative histologic criteria required to diagnose GS are presented. In most cases the sarcomatous component was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma; a minority were fibrosarcoma. No significant differences between GS and GBM were found with regard to age, sex, pretreatment Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, size, median survival (8.3 and 9.6 months, respectively), and actuarial survival. None of the treatment regimens, which included various combinations of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, improved the survival of GS over GBM. Selective involvement of the temporal lobe by GS was not found, and the frequency of GS was determined to be only 1.8% of all GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1849447
"""True progression versus pseudoprogression in the treatment of glioblastomas: a comparison study of normalized cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient by histogram analysis.""","""Objective: The purpose of this study was to differentiate true progression from pseudoprogression of glioblastomas treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ) by using histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) maps. Materials and methods: Twenty patients with histopathologically proven glioblastoma who had received CCRT with TMZ underwent perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 0, 1000 sec/mm(2)). The corresponding nCBV and ADC maps for the newly visible, entirely enhancing lesions were calculated after the completion of CCRT with TMZ. Two observers independently measured the histogram parameters of the nCBV and ADC maps. The histogram parameters between the true progression group (n = 10) and the pseudoprogression group (n = 10) were compared by use of an unpaired Student's t test and subsequent multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine the best predictors for the differential diagnosis between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to determine the best cutoff values for the histogram parameters that proved to be significant predictors for differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine the level of inter-observer reliability for the histogram parameters. Results: The 5th percentile value (C5) of the cumulative ADC histograms was a significant predictor for the differential diagnosis between true progression and pseudoprogression (p = 0.044 for observer 1; p = 0.011 for observer 2). Optimal cutoff values of 892 × 10(-6) mm(2)/sec for observer 1 and 907 × 10(-6) mm(2)/sec for observer 2 could help differentiate between the two groups with a sensitivity of 90% and 80%, respectively, a specificity of 90% and 80%, respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.880 and 0.840, respectively. There was no other significant differentiating parameter on the nCBV histograms. Inter-observer reliability was excellent or good for all histogram parameters (intraclass correlation coefficient range: 0.70-0.99). Conclusion: The C5 of the cumulative ADC histogram can be a promising parameter for the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression of newly visible, entirely enhancing lesions after CCRT with TMZ for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23901325
"""Pre-operative hematological markers as predictive factors for overall survival and progression free survival in glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Several hematological factors, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutrition index (PNI) and albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), have been highlighted as systemic worse prognostic parameters for the outcome in gliomas. The aim of this study is to identify some pre-operative routinely blood tests as predictive parameters for the Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) in glioblastoma (GBM). Materials and methods: From January 2013 to April 2019, 124 patients operated for glioblastoma were analyzed. Data were collected regarding age, sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), IDH status, the extent of resection (EOR) and adjuvant therapy. The hematological parameters were collected at admission: neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, NLR, PLR, AGR and PNI. The OS and the PFS were considered as the end-point for the evaluation of the predictive factors. Results: A pre-operative neutrophil count > 7 × 109/L was a worse prognostic factor for OS and PFS at univariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.025), as well as hypo-albuminemia. Thrombocytosis, lymphopenia and NLR > 4 were associated to a worse OS, at uni- and multivariate analysis, resulting as poor predictive parameters, independently to EOR, the IDH mutation and the adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: Still nowadays there are no sensitive or specific hematological markers which are routinely applied for detecting and monitoring the treatment-response and the prognosis of glioblastoma. In our study, a pre-operative low cost and widely used blood markers, such as NLR, lymphocytes and platelets could be predictable prognostic factors for the Overall Survival of patients affected by glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32890893

Various prognostic biomarkers for GBM have been described, including survivin expression. The aim of this study was to determine whether the subcellular localization of survivin correlates with GBM prognosis in patients who received the standard treatment protocol. METHODS The authors retrospectively examined the subcellular localization of survivin (nuclear, cytoplasmic, or both) using immunohistochemistry in 50 patients with GBM who had received the standard treatment. The relationship between survivin localization and overall survival (OS) was assessed with uni- and multivariate analyses including other clinicopathological factors (age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale [KPS] score, extent of resection, the use of second-line bevacizumab, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] status, and MIB-1 labeling index). RESULTS Log-rank tests revealed that patient age, KPS score, extent of resection, MGMT status, and survivin localization (p < 0.0001) significantly correlated with OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that patient age, MGMT status, and survivin localization significantly correlated with OS. Patients with nuclear localization of survivin had a significantly shorter OS than those in whom survivin expression was exclusively cytoplasmic (median OS 19.5 vs 31.7 months, respectively, HR 5.690, 95% CI 2.068-17.612, p = 0.0006). There was no significant difference in OS between patents whose survivin expression was exclusively nuclear or nuclear/cytoplasmic. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear expression of survivin is a factor for a poor prognosis in GBM patients. Subcellular localization of survivin can help to predict OS in GBM patients treated with the standard protocol.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28430038
"""Radiation therapy for malignant astrocytomas in adults.""","""High grade (or malignant) astrocytomas remain a formidable therapeutic challenge. The main prognostic factors are patient age, patient performance status, tumor grade, the extent of surgical resection and the presence of fits. These factors could help to identify different groups of patients and should be an advantage in deciding on treatment strategies. Modern imaging techniques provide a more precise idea of tumor volume. The study of tumor recurrence shows that they occur in the immediate vicinity of the primary site. Surgery aside, radiotherapy remains the most important treatment modality. Currently, its standards concerning optimal dose and target volume appear to be accepted overall. There is no doubt that a dose-response relation exists; however, doses exceeding 60 Gy increase morbidity. Therefore 60 Gy is the dose most often cited in the literature. Furthermore, as whole brain irradiation does not decrease the risk of recurrence, a focal irradiation including a defined mean volume is generally used today. Radiosensitizers and heavy particles have not fulfilled their initial promise. Brachytherapy remains an interesting alternative for a limited number of patients. Nevertheless, it seems to increase recurrence at a distance from the primary site and to lead to severe focal lesions. Interstitial thermoradiotherapy may minimize local doses and thus help avoid serious local necrosis. Amongst the other therapeutic alternatives, intravenous chemotherapy using nitrosoureas provides a certain but modest benefit. Other administration modalities are currently undergoing evaluation. These include intra-arterial chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy with auto-bone marrow transplantation. The interest of this latter is concerned mainly with anaplastic astrocytomas. Finally, among the future alternatives, gene therapy appears to hold the most promise. Intensive therapies, combined modality treatments, with the recent help of biological innovations, should be proposed to favorable groups of patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8210454

Methods: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years) with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 ± 1.7) were retrospectively studied. Results: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial resection (13 months; p = 0.011).

Methodology: The inclusion criteria included case reports or series of primary spinal cord GBMs, while excluding inconclusive histopathological cases and articles not in English or Portuguese. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PubMed and Mendeley search engines. Results: The data from 237 patients (mean age: 28.6 years; male-to-female ratio 1.35:1) were analyzed. On radiological imaging, GBMs exhibited patterns similar to those of cranial GBMs. Most tumors were located in the cervical and thoracic regions, with motor deficits as the primary presenting symptom. Almost all patients underwent surgical treatment (88,6%), often followed by adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy (56.5 %) and radiotherapy (68 %). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.5 months, while overall survival (OS) was 15.3 months, with no significant sex or age differences observed.

Most glioblastoma cell lines are, in contrast to glioblastomas in vivo, relatively radiosensitive. This limits the value of using cell lines for studying the radiation effect of glioblastomas. The advantage of OMS is maintenance of the characteristics of the original tumour, which is lost in conventional cell cultures. OMS prepared from four glioblastomas were treated with hypofractionated radiation with a radiobiologically equivalent dose to standard radiation treatment for glioblastoma patients. After treatment, the histology as well as the cell proliferation of the OMS was examined. After radiation, a significant decrease in cell proliferation was found, although no histological damage to the OMS was observed. The modest effects of radiation on the OMS are in agreement with the limited therapeutic value of radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients.

This conflict may be explained by the fact these cancers are often only sub-totally resected and radiotherapy and chemotherapies fail to control this significant local cancer burden. We analyzed the failure pattern in 20 consecutive patients with complete resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portion of GBM demonstrated on the immediate post-operative magnetic resonance study, and who underwent a radical course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We found that recurrences occurred only at the resection margin in 17 of 20 patients. Recurrences were exclusively distant in 2 of 20 patients and occurred at both the resection margin and a distant site in 1 of 20 cases.

Methods and materials: A total of 22 patients with primary GBMs underwent DCE-MRI before, during and after completion of adjuvant chemoradiation. K (trans) (transfer constant between the intravascular and extravascular, extracellular space), v(e) (extracellular, extravascular volume) and IAUGC (initial area under the gadolinium concentration time curve) and their changes into treatment were assessed as prognostic markers (12 months of progression-free-survival (PFS)). Results: Both responders (7 subjects) and non-responders (15 subjects) experienced a reduction in the baseline IAUGC and v(e) values during the early phase of the treatment. This reduction was more prominent in the responders and was statistically significant for the v(e) (P = 0.04). Baseline K (trans) values among responders demonstrated statistically significant reduction during the early phase of treatment (P = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated significant relationship between response and the early changes in K (trans) values during the treatment (P = 0.04). Trend to significant prognostic value demonstrated the baseline K (trans), v(e) and IAUGC as well as the changes of IAUGC and K (trans) upon therapy completion.

In this study, we investigated the in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) using human glioblastoma cell lines. Glioblastoma cells were transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding BAI1 (AdBAI1), and Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively, demonstrated BAI1 mRNA and protein expression in the transduced tumor cells. Using an in vivo neovascularization assay, we found that angiogenesis surrounding AdBAI1-transduced glioblastoma cells transplanted into transparent skinfold chambers of SCID mice was significantly impaired compared to control treated cells. Additionally, in vivo inoculation with AdBAI1 of established subcutaneous or intracerebral transplanted tumors significantly impaired tumor growth and promoted increased mouse survival. Morphologically, the tumors exhibited signs of impaired angiogenesis, such as extensive necrosis and reduced intratumoral vascular density. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that BAI1 may be an excellent gene therapy candidate for the treatment of brain tumors, especially human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244591

Median overall survival (OS) for newly diagnosed patients is only about 12 to 18 months. GBM tumors invariably recur, and there is no widely recognized and effective standard treatment for recurrent GBM. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). Response duration was highly correlated with OS (r(2) = .92, P<.0001), and median OS for responders was 24.8 months. Seven of 16 responders exhibited initial tumor growth on magnetic resonance imaging. Compliance appeared to be linked with both improved response and survival. The tumor growth model predicted tumor arrest and shrinkage only after several weeks of continuous NovoTTF Therapy, consistent with the observed clinical findings of initial transient tumor growth in some patients. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients. Some responders exhibit initial tumor growth before shrinkage, indicating treatment should not be terminated prior to allowing for the full effect of NovoTTF Therapy to be realized.

Some experiments in vitro and in vivo have been done and shown promising results, but have been never compared quantitatively with mathematical models. We use in vitro data of this virus applied to glioblastoma. Results: We describe three increasingly realistic mathematical models for the VSV-GBM in vitro experiment with progressive incorporation of time-delay effects. For the virus dynamics, we obtain results consistent with the in vitro experimental speed data only when applying the more complex and comprehensive model, with time-delay effects both in the reactive and diffusive terms. The tumor speed is given by the minimum of a very simple function that nonetheless yields results within the experimental measured range. Conclusions: We have improved a previous model with new ideas and carefully incorporated concepts from experimental results. We have shown that the delay time τ is the crucial parameter in this kind of models. We have demonstrated that our new model can satisfactorily predict the front speed for the lytic action of oncolytic VSV on glioblastoma observed in vitro.

"""Acute Temporal Changes of MRI-Tracked Tumor Vascular Parameters after Combined Anti-angiogenic and Radiation Treatments in a Rat Glioma Model: Identifying Signatures of Synergism.""","""In this study we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers to monitor the acute temporal changes in tumor vascular physiology with the aim of identifying the vascular signatures that predict response to combined anti-angiogenic and radiation treatments. Forty-three athymic rats implanted with orthotopic U-251 glioma cells were studied for approximately 21 days after implantation. Two MRI studies were performed on each animal, pre- and post-treatment, to measure tumor vascular parameters. Two animal groups received treatment comprised of Cilengitide, an anti-angiogenic agent and radiation. The first group received a subcurative regimen of Cilengitide 1 h before irradiation, while the second group received a curative regimen of Cilengitide 8 h before irradiation. Cilengitide was given as a single dose (4 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) after the pretreatment MRI study and before receiving a 20 Gy radiation dose. After irradiation, the post-treatment MRI study was performed at selected time points: 2, 4, 8 and 12 h (n = ≥5 per time point). Significant changes in vascular parameters were observed at early time points after combined treatments in both treatment groups (1 and 8 h). The temporal changes in vascular parameters in the first group (treated 1 h before exposure) resembled a previously reported pattern associated with radiation exposure alone. Conversely, in the second group (treated 8 h before exposure), all vascular parameters showed an initial response at 2-4 h postirradiation, followed by an apparent lack of response at later time points. The signature time point to define the 'synergy' of Cilengitide and radiation was 4 h postirradiation. For example, 4 h after combined treatments using a 1 h separation (which followed the subcurative regimen), tumor blood flow was significantly decreased, nearly 50% below baseline (P = 0.007), whereas 4 h after combined treatments using an 8 h separation (which followed the curative regimen), tumor blood flow was only 10% less than baseline. Comparison between the first and second groups further revealed that most other vascular parameters were maximally different 4 h after combined treatments. In conclusion, the data are consistent with the assertion that the delivery of radiation at the vascular normalization time window of Cilengitide improves radiation treatment outcome. The different vascular responses after the different delivery times of combined treatments in light of the known tumor responses under similar conditions would indicate that timing has a crucial influence on treatment outcome and long-term survival. Tracking acute changes in tumor physiology after monotherapy or combined treatments appears to aid in identifying the beneficial timing for administration, and perhaps has predictive value. Therefore, judicial timing of treatments may result in optimal treatment response.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28001908
"""Stratification according to recursive partitioning analysis predicts outcome in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastoma accounts for more than half of diffuse gliomas. The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma remains poor despite comprehensive and intensive treatments. Furthermore, the clinical significance of molecular parameters and routinely available clinical variables for the prognosis prediction of glioblastomas remains limited. The authors describe a novel model may help in prognosis prediction and clinical management of glioblastoma patients. We performed a recursive partitioning analysis to generate three independent prognostic classes of 103 glioblastomas patients from TCGA dataset. Class I (MGMT promoter methylated, age <58), class II (MGMT promoter methylation, age ≥58; MGMT promoter unmethylation, age <54, KPS ≥70; MGMT promoter unmethylation, age >59, KPS ≥70), class III (MGMT promoter unmethylation, age 54-58, KPS ≥70; MGMT promoter unmethylation, KPS <70). Age, KPS and MGMT promoter methylation were the most significant prognostic factors for overall survival. The results were validated in CGGA dataset.This was the first study to combine various molecular parameters and clinical factors into recursive partitioning analysis to predict the prognosis of patients with glioblastomas. We included MGMT promoter methylation in our study, which could give better suggestion to patients for their chemotherapy. This clinical study will serve as the backbone for the future incorporation of molecular prognostic markers currently in development.

"""Genomic expression patterns distinguish long-term from short-term glioblastoma survivors: a preliminary feasibility study.""","""We used microarray analysis to investigate associations between genotypic expression profiles and survival phenotypes in patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM). Tumor samples from 7 long-term glioblastoma survivors (>24 months) and 13 short-term survivors (<9 months) were analyzed to detect differential patterns of gene expression between these groups and to identify genotypic subclasses of glioblastomas that correlate with survival phenotypes. Five unsupervised and three supervised clustering algorithms consistently and accurately grouped the tumors into genotypic subgroups corresponding to the two clinical survival phenotypes. Three unique prospective mathematical classification algorithms were subsequently trained to use expression data to stratify unknown glioblastomas between survival groups and performed this task with 100% accuracy in validation studies. A set of 1478 genes with significant differential expression (p<0.01) between long-term and short-term survivors was identified, and additional mathematical filtering was used to isolate a 43-gene 'fingerprint' that distinguished survival phenotypes. Differential regulation of a subset of these genes was confirmed using RT-PCR. Gene ontology analysis of the fingerprint demonstrated pathophysiologic functions for the gene products that are consistent with current models of tumor biology, suggesting that differential expression of these genes may contribute etiologically to the observed differences in survival. These results demonstrate that unique expression profiles characterize genotypic subsets of primary GBMs associated with differential survival phenotypes, and these profiles can be used in a prospective fashion to assign unknown tumors to survival groups. Future efforts will focus on building more robust classifiers and identifying additional subclasses of gliomas with phenotypic significance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18343632

Sulfasalazine, an anti-inflammatory drug that specifically inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB, blocked the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in several glioblastoma cell lines and primary cultures, as did gene therapy with a vector encoding a super-repressor of NF-kappaB.

The diagnosis of GBM is based on histological features, however, few studies have evaluated their prognostic relevance in light of the latest WHO classification of 2007. Aim: In this study we have evaluated the prognostic value of several clinical and histological characteristics encountered in human GBMs according to the WHO 2007 criteria. Material and methods: 199 patients with primary GBM consecutively operated and histologically reviewed according to the 2007 WHO scheme, were included. Several clinical and histological features were recorded and related to survival. Results: Mean age of the GBM patients at diagnosis was 62 years (range 21 - 84). Male/female ratio was 1.3/1, and the median survival was 8.0 months (95% CI: 7.1 - 9.0 months). In a multivariate COX analysis age, WHO performance score, subcortical localization, extent of surgery, radiation treatment, chemotherapy, and the presence of large necrosis had individual effect on overall survival (p < 0.05). In addition, females, tumors with angiocentric growth, with pseudopalisades, or without lymphocyte infiltration were related to shorter survival in univariate analyses (p < 0.05).

"""Glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component have the same clinical phenotype as classical glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas are the commonest primary brain tumour and are considered one of the most heterogeneous tumour types. The introduction of a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component (GBM + O) in the latest WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (1) was to help with this. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether this tumour conferred a better prognosis than classical glioblastoma (GBM). The aim of this study was to study the clinical phenotype of these GBM + O tumours and compare it to the classical GBM. Materials and methods: All patients with histological evidence of a glioblastoma between 1st January 2007 and 31st January 2011 were identified from the Neuropathology Database. Clinical and radiological details were obtained for all patients. The overall survival of patients who were treated with chemoradiotherapy was obtained and the GBM + O cohort compared to the classical GBM cohort. Results: Three hundred and ninety-six patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were identified: 294 (74.2%) had classical GBM and 102 (25.6%) had GBM + O. The two cohorts presented at a similar age (61.1 years GBM + O vs. 63.2 years GBM; P = 0.09) and were matched for sex and side of the tumour. GBM + O were more likely to be located in the frontal lobes (38.2% for GBM + O vs. 27.2% for GBM: P = 0.04). In the group that was treated with chemoradiotherapy the overall survival was similar (median survival GBM + O 361 days vs. 379 days GBM; Log Rank 0.61, P = 0.43).

Materials and methods: Seventy-nine patients with histologically-confirmed Glioblastoma multiforma and documented recurrence who were irradiated in our department between 1990 and 1996 were reviewed. With the help of a computer program written for this purpose, the PTV of the CT-based treatment plan was reconstructed and its spatial outline compared with the reconstructed volume of the recurrent tumour in the control CT-study. Results: In 33 out 34 patients for which the CT-study showing tumour-recurrence was available the recurrence was completely situated within the original 90%-isodose. Only one tumour surpassed the outside surface of the PTV but was predominantly situated within the original tumourbed and suggests a tumour-regrowth within the high dose volume. Conclusions: The above results show that target-volumes based on the preoperative size of the enhanced tumour mass well cover the site of recurrence in nearly all cases.

Despite a general policy during the study period of treatment by surgical intervention aimed at maximum tumor removal followed by radiotherapy, there was a marked tendency toward limited treatment with advancing patient age. Of those younger than 65 years, 82% were treated either with surgery followed by radiotherapy, surgery alone or radiotherapy alone, versus 47% of patients 65 years or older. Only 25% of patients older than 75 years underwent surgery and/or radiotherapy, while the remaining patients were given best supportive care (BSC). The mean ages of patients were 54.5 years for those treated with surgery and radiotherapy, 58.3 years for surgery alone, 62.2 years for radiotherapy alone and 69.2 years for BSC. Among patients who were treated with surgery plus radiotherapy and those treated with radiotherapy alone, younger patients (<60 years) had a significantly higher survival rate than older patients (>or=60 years). In contrast, no significant difference in survival was observed between younger and older patients treated with surgery alone or receiving BSC, suggesting that lower survival rates in elderly patients with glioblastoma may be at least in part due to a lesser response to radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19325245
"""Gene therapy of experimental brain tumors using neural progenitor cells.""","""Glioblastomas, the most frequent and malignant of primary brain tumors, have a very poor prognosis. Gene therapy of glioblastomas is limited by the short survival of viral vectors and by their difficulty in reaching glioblastoma cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma. Neural stem/progenitor cells can be engineered to produce therapeutic molecules and have the potential to overcome these limitations because they may travel along the white matter, like neoplastic cells, and engraft stably into the brain. Retrovirus-mediated transfer of the gene for interleukin-4 is an effective treatment for rat brain glioblastomas. Here, we transferred the gene for interleukin-4 into C57BL6J mouse primary neural progenitor cells and injected those cells into established syngeneic brain glioblastomas. This led to the survival of most tumor-bearing mice. We obtained similar results by implanting immortalized neural progenitor cells derived from Sprague-Dawley rats into C6 glioblastomas. We also documented by magnetic resonance imaging the progressive disappearance of large tumors, and detected 5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeled progenitor cells several weeks after the injection.

Immunofluorescence was adopted for detecting glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein H (gH) of HCMV's in glioblastoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier Analysis and Chi Square were used to evaluate patients' survival and the association between HCMV infection and patients' characteristics respectively. We found that the presence rate of gB and gH were 48.5% (33/68) and 42.6% (29/68) in glioblastomas respectively. The co-occurrence of gB and gH was 30.8%, and the presence rates of either gB or gH in glioblastomas was 60.3%. While IDH R132H mutations were significantly correlated with a better clinical outcome (p=0.006), the presence of neither gB (p=0.551) nor gH (p=0.871) had prognostic values. Furthermore, there was no significant association between the presence of HCMV and gliomas' characteristics, neither with patients' age, gender, KPS, IDH mutations nor PTEN loss.

These tumors are heterogeneous being constituted by a variety of cells in different states of differentiation. Among these, cells endowed with stem properties, tumor initiating/propagating properties and particularly resistant to chemo- and radiotherapies are designed as the real culprits for tumor maintenance and relapse after treatment. These cells, termed cancer stem-like cells, have been designed as prominent targets for new and more efficient cancer therapies. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of membrane receptors, play a prominent role in cell signaling, cell communication and crosstalk with the microenvironment. Their role in cancer has been highlighted but remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a descriptive study of the differential expression of the endo-GPCR repertoire in human glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GSCs), U-87 MG cells, human astrocytes and fetal neural stem cells (f-NSCs). The endo-GPCR transcriptome has been studied using Taqman Low Density Arrays. Of the 356 GPCRs investigated, 138 were retained for comparative studies between the different cell types.

"""The prognostic role of IDH mutations in homogeneously treated patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.""","""The detection of IDH mutations in patients with diffusely infiltrating malignant astrocytomas resulted in substantial modifications in the concept of WHO classification of these tumors. An important underlying observation was that patients with anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) without IDH mutation had a clinical course similar to that of patients with glioblastomas (GBM). The underlying observations of the German Glioma Network and NOA-04, however, were based on mixed patient cohorts. While most GBM patients received combined radiochemotherapy, patients with AA usually had radiotherapy or chemotherapy only. This intrinsic shortcoming of the study raised the question of whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III, might have better prognosis if treated with combined radiochemotherapy than patients with GBM receiving the same combination therapy. Thus, the question remains whether the established histopathological grading criteria for malignant astrocytomas in the absence of an IDH mutation are still important if neither vascular proliferation nor necrosis are detectable. All patients in the cohort investigated here with the diagnosis of AA or GBM were subjected to a combined radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol independently of the histopathological diagnosis. Thus, the analysis of these patients allows to clarify whether patients with AA, IDH wildtype, WHO grade III have a prognosis similar to that of GBM, IDH wildtype, WHO grade IV, even under equivalent therapeutic conditions. We determined the IDH1 and IDH2 status by sequencing, the MGMT status by pyrosequencing after bisulfite treatment and the EGFR status of the patients by FISH. In fact, the patients with the histopathological diagnosis of an AA IDH wild-type under similar aggressive therapy showed a comparable and therefore no better prognosis (median overall survival (mOS) 16 months) than patients with a GBM (mOS 13 months). Instead, patients with an AA and an IDH mutation receiving the same therapy had a mOS of 54 months. Thus, it can be concluded that in the absence of an IDH mutation, the established histopathological grading criteria 'necrosis' and 'vascular proliferation' actually lose their prognostic significance. If, on the other hand, patients with malignant astrocytomas and an IDH mutation are examined, there is still a difference between patients with necrosis and/or vascular proliferation and those whose tumors do not show such characteristics. Accordingly, in patients with malignant astrocytomas with IDH mutation it can be concluded that a histological differentiation between AA IDH mutated and GBM IDH mutated remains beneficial from a prognostic perspective.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31623667

To compare this result in routine clinical practice, an audit of the management and outcome of patients with glioblastoma at our institute was performed. Methods: A total of 79 patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma were treated with radiotherapy (daily fractions of 2 Gy for a total of 60 Gy) combined with temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) per day, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), 5 consecutive days per month). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. We evaluated the clinical outcome of concomitant chemoradiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastomas at a single institute in Korea. Results: The median age was 52 years (15-76 years), 47 patients were male and 32 patients were female. 92.4% of the patients had undergone debulking surgery. The median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months (95% CI, 16.3-20.1 months), and the time to progression was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.2-8.3 months). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 70.1% and 37.1%, respectively.

Hematologic toxicity was the main adverse effect, occurring in seven patients (8.8%). Patients with lymphopenia were not reported. Conclusions: This study is the largest study of radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma in Korean patients, who share a common genetic feature. The median and 2-year survival outcomes in this study are comparable to the previous reports.

Methods: In nine cases they treated T1 tumours with single HDR-AL boost of 10-12 Gy dose following the conventional fractionated 60 Gy external beam radiotherapy. In fifteen patients with T2-4 tumours an intensified, hypofractionated regimen with 2.25-2.5 Gy daily and 60 Gy total dose was applied. All the treatments were carried out with image-based conformal methods. Results: Majority of patients endured treatments without neurological deterioration. Transient neurotoxiticy was noticed in one and two cases, respectively. The median survival times (MST) were found to be 17 months (range: 9-25) and 12 months (range: 6-38) in the two groups, respectively. With respect to all patients, the MST was 13 months, while this value in the conventional treatment is generally considered to be 9-10 months.

Aim of this work is to compare Parametric Response Maps (PRMs) with the Region Of Interest (ROI) approach in the analysis of tumor changes induced by bevacizumab and irinotecan in recurrent glioblastomas (rGBM), and to evaluate if changes in tumor blood volume measured by perfusion MRI may predict clinical outcome. Methods: 42 rGBM patients with KPS ≥ 50 were treated until progression, as defined by MRI with RANO criteria. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) variation after 8 weeks of treatment was calculated through semi-automatic ROI placement in the same anatomic region as in baseline. Alternatively, rCBV variations with respect to baseline were calculated into the evolving tumor region using a voxel-by-voxel difference. PRMs were created showing where rCBV significantly increased, decreased or remained unchanged. Results: An increased blood volume in PRM (PRMCBV+) higher than 18% (first quartile) after 8 weeks of treatment was associated with increased progression free survival (PFS; 24 versus 13 weeks, p = 0.045) and overall survival (OS; 38 versus 25 weeks, p = 0.016). After 8 weeks of treatment ROI analysis showed that mean rCBV remained elevated in non responsive patients (4.8 ± 0.9 versus 5.1 ± 1.2, p = 0.38), whereas decreased in responsive patients (4.2 ± 1.3 versus 3.8 ± 1.6 p = 0.04), and re-increased progressively when patients approached tumor progression.

"""Diffusion tensor invasive phenotypes can predict progression-free survival in glioblastomas.""","""Introduction: Glioblastomas multiformes (GBM) remain incurable in most cases. Their invasion into normal brain makes current therapies ineffective. Post-mortem studies suggest about a 25% of GBMs invade less than 1 cm from the tumour bulk and 20% invade more than 3 cm. Aim of study: The study aims to use DTI to assess tumour extension and determine how previously reported patterns relate to the progression-free survival (PFS). Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients with GBM treated according to the EORTC/NCIC protocol were retrospectively analysed. Patients were imaged post-operatively at 1.5 T. The sequences were composed of standard anatomical and a standard DTI sequence. As described earlier p and q maps were constructed. For each of the p and q maps, regions of interest were drawn around the visible abnormality. Patients were assigned a diffuse, localised or minimally invasive pattern. Progression was defined according to the RANO criteria (4) and PFS determined in days. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival for the three groups were plotted as were the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 24 months. Results: The median PFS for the diffuse group was 278 days, for the localised group 605 days and 820 days for the minimally invasive group. Three-fourth of the minimally invasive group were progression-free at 24 months (LOG RANK 9.25; p = 0.010). Conclusion: It is possible to identify three invasive phenotypes in GBMs using Diffusion tensor imaging , and these three phenotypes have different progression free survival. A minimal phenotype (20% of patients) predicts a greater delay to progression.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23445331
"""LuIII parvovirus selectively and efficiently targets, replicates in, and kills human glioma cells.""","""Because productive infection by parvoviruses requires cell division and is enhanced by oncogenic transformation, some parvoviruses may have potential utility in killing cancer cells. To identify the parvovirus(es) with the optimal oncolytic effect against human glioblastomas, we screened 12 parvoviruses at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). MVMi, MVMc, MVM-G17, tumor virus X (TVX), canine parvovirus (CPV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), rat parvovirus 1A (RPV1A), and H-3 were relatively ineffective. The four viruses with the greatest oncolytic activity, LuIII, H-1, MVMp, and MVM-G52, were tested for the ability, at a low MOI, to progressively infect the culture over time, causing cell death at a rate higher than that of cell proliferation. LuIII alone was effective in all five human glioblastomas tested. H-1 progressively infected only two of five; MVMp and MVM-G52 were ineffective in all five. To investigate the underlying mechanism of LuIII's phenotype, we used recombinant parvoviruses with the LuIII capsid replacing the MVMp capsid or with molecular alteration of the P4 promoter. The LuIII capsid enhanced efficient replication and oncolysis in MO59J gliomas cells; other gliomas tested required the entire LuIII genome to exhibit enhanced infection. LuIII selectively infected glioma cells over normal glial cells in vitro. In mouse models, human glioblastoma xenografts were selectively infected by LuIII when administered intratumorally; LuIII reduced tumor growth by 75%. LuIII also had the capacity to selectively infect subcutaneous or intracranial gliomas after intravenous inoculation. Intravenous or intracranial LuIII caused no adverse effects. Intracranial LuIII caused no infection of mature mouse neurons or glia in vivo but showed a modest infection of developing neurons.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22553327
"""A model using radiation and plasmid-mediated tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene therapy for treatment of glioblastomas.""","""The efficacy of radiotherapy for cancer is limited by the dose that can be safely delivered to the tumor without causing debilitating side effects. Previous studies have shown an additive or syngeneic reduction in the volume of malignant tumors when tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) protein is administered prior to radiation. The major goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of pGL1-TNF-alpha, a new plasmid construct that expresses human TNF-alpha protein, together with radiotherapy in the C6 glioma/athymic mouse model. Subcutaneously growing tumors were injected with pGL1-TNF-alpha complexed with a cationic polyamine and radiation, singly and in combination, over an 8-day period. The maximum antitumor effect was achieved with the combination of polyamine-pGL1-TNF-alpha and radiation. Each modality used alone, including polyamine, modestly slowed tumor growth. In vitro evaluations of blood, spleen, and tumor indicated that the antitumor mechanisms of combination therapy may include, at least partly, the recruitment and activation of nonspecific effector cells. The results demonstrate that polyamine-pGL1-TNF-alpha can be safely and effectively administered together with radiation under the conditions used.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10652573
"""High dose hyperfractionated radiotherapy for adults with glioblastomas.""","""From 1989 to 1991, 27 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma of the brain were treated with radiotherapy. Fifteen of twenty-seven patients were treated through limited volume fields, with a thrice-a-day (1.1 Gy/f) or twice-a-day (1.4 Gy/f) hyperfractionated regimen to a total physical dose of 62-92 Gy (median dose 76 Gy). The remaining 12 were treated with whole brain irradiation (40 Gy of total conventionally fractionated dose) and a localised boost to a total dose of 60 Gy. The hyperfractionated regimen was well tolerated and there was no sign of increased brain oedema to indicate the insertion of a split. Of six patients who received a NTD10 (normalised total dose for alpha/beta = 10) higher than 71 Gy, five showed CR (83% CR rate) versus three of 21 patients who received a lower NTD10 (14% CR rate). For 13 patients who received a NTD10 higher than 66 Gy, the 18-months survival was 61% (8/13) versus 28% (4/14) for 14 patients who received a NTD10 less than 66 Gy. As far as the late morbidity is concerned, of six patients treated with 76-92 Gy of physical dose, none died because of radiation-induced brain necrosis within 18-42 months of follow-up, and three of them are without evidence of disease 18-31 months after the end of radiation treatment. None of our 15 patients who received less than whole brain irradiation relapsed outside the radiation portals. The present study strongly suggests the use of limited volume hyperfractionated radiotherapy schemes, so as to increase the local tumor dose (NTD10) to values higher than 79 Gy, at the same time keeping the NTD2 (NTD for alpha/beta = 2) below 68 Gy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8280367
"""Clinicopathological features and molecular analysis of primary glioblastomas in Moroccan patients.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Primary and secondary glioblastomas develop through different genetic pathways. The aim of this study was to determinate the genetic and clinical features of primary glioblastoma in Moroccan patients. The blood and tumor samples were obtained from a group of 34 Moroccan patients affected with primary glioblastoma. The tumors were investigated for TP53, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations using PCR sequencing analysis. Clinicopathological data showed that the mean age at diagnosis of patients was 50.06 years, the sex ratio was 11 F/23 M, and the median of Karnofsky performance score was 60. About 18 % of patients were initially treated by total tumor resection, 41 % by subtotal, and 38 % by partial resection, but biopsy was performed for a single patient (3 %). Twenty-five patients (74 %) received radiotherapy. In addition, the median survival of the all patients was 13 months following diagnosis. There was a significant impact of higher Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (≥80) on overall survival, p-log-rank test = 0.0002, whereas other parameters did not show any significant differences. The molecular analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 3/34 (8.82 %) cases; R273H, R306X, and Q136X. However, none of the analyzed samples contained the R132-IDH1 or R172-IDH2 mutations. These results showed the absence of IDH1 mutation in primary glioblastoma, confirming that this mutation is a hallmark of secondary glioblastoma. It can be used to distinguish primary from secondary glioblastomas. We found also that higher KPS was a significantly favorable factor in patients with primary glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22865003
"""An extent of resection threshold for newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Object: The value of extent of resection (EOR) in improving survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains controversial. Specifically, it is unclear what proportion of contrast-enhancing tumor must be resected for a survival advantage and how much survival improves beyond this threshold. The authors attempt to define these values for the patient with newly diagnosed GBM in the modern neurosurgical era. Methods: The authors identified 500 consecutive newly diagnosed patients with supratentorial GBM treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1997 and 2009. Clinical, radiographic, and outcome parameters were measured for each case, including MR imaging-based volumetric tumor analysis. Results: The patients had a median age of 60 years and presented with a median Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score of 80. The mean clinical follow-up period was 15.3 months, and no patient was unaccounted for. All patients underwent resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The median postoperative tumor volume was 2.3 cm(3), equating to a 96% EOR. The median overall survival was 12.2 months. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, age, KPS score, and EOR were predictive of survival (p < 0.0001). A significant survival advantage was seen with as little as 78% EOR, and stepwise improvement in survival was evident even in the 95%-100% EOR range. A recursive partitioning analysis validated these findings and provided additional risk stratification parameters related to age, EOR, and tumor burden. Conclusions: For patients with newly diagnosed GBMs, aggressive EOR equates to improvement in overall survival, even at the highest levels of resection. Interestingly, subtotal resections as low as 78% also correspond to a survival benefit.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21417701
"""Human cerebral gliomas: correlation of postmortem MR imaging and neuropathologic findings.""","""Findings from T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained of postmortem, in vitro human brain glioma specimens were correlated with histologic findings from whole-brain sections. Eighteen cases were categorized as untreated (n = 6), in remission after surgery and radiation therapy (n = 2), or recurrent (n = 10). Findings from MR images generally correlated well with the histologic extent of untreated tumors in white matter; the heterogeneous appearance of glioblastomas multiforme distinguished them from less malignant gliomas. Subpial spread and tumor in the subarachnoid space were not visualized. The extent of tumors in remission was overestimated on MR images because of the extensive surrounding edema and radiation necrosis. MR imaging findings correlated well with those from 48% of brain slices, but resulted in overestimations (24%) or underestimations (28%) of tumor extent in the ten cases of recurrent tumor. The results suggest that information concerning the patient's stage of disease is important in interpreting MR images of gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2535765
"""Extent of MGMT promoter methylation correlates with outcome in glioblastomas given temozolomide and radiotherapy.""","""Background: Epigenetic silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) by promoter methylation is associated with improved survival in glioblastomas treated with alkylating agents. In this study, we investigated MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy in a single UK treatment centre. Methods: Quantitative methylation data at individual CpG sites were obtained by pyrosequencing for 109 glioblastomas. Results: Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months with 2-year survival of 17.9%. Pyrosequencing data were reproducible with archival samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. Variation in methylation patterns of discrete CpG sites and intratumoral methylation heterogeneity were observed. A total of 58 out of 109 glioblastomas showed average methylation >non-neoplastic brain in at least one clinical sample; 86% had homogeneous methylation status in multiple samples. Methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Cases with methylation more than 35% had the longest survival (median PFS 19.2; OS 26.2 months, 2-year survival of 59.7%). Significant differences in PFS were seen between those with intermediate or high methylation and unmethylated cases, whereas cases with low, intermediate or high methylation all showed significantly different OS. Conclusions: These data indicate that MGMT methylation is prognostically significant in glioblastomas given chemoradiotherapy in the routine clinic; furthermore, the extent of methylation may be used to provide additional prognostic stratification.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19536096
"""Long term results of stereotactic brachytherapy used in the initial treatment of patients with glioblastomas.""","""Background: Despite optimal therapy with surgery and radiotherapy, the prognosis of patients with glioblastomas remains poor. Stereotactic brachytherapy involves the accurate placement of radioactive isotopes within brain tumors, significantly increasing the dose of radiation that can be delivered to the tumor bed without substantial risk to surrounding normal tissue, potentially improving local tumor control and patient survival. Methods: Between February 1987 and July 1993, the authors treated 56 patients with glioblastomas with stereotactic brachytherapy as part of their initial therapy. Patients underwent surgery, limited field external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy with temporary high-activity iodine 125 sources, giving an additional 50 Gy to the tumor bed. Results: Median survival for patients undergoing brachytherapy was 18 months compared with 11 months for a matched brachytherapy control group with similar clinical and radiologic features (P < 0.0007). Survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis of 83%, 34%, and 27%, respectively, for patients receiving brachytherapy were significantly increased compared with survival rates of 40%, 12.5%, and 9%, respectively, for control subjects. Thirty-six patients (64%) underwent reoperation for symptomatic radiation necrosis from 3 to 42 months (median, 11 months) after brachytherapy. The median survival of patients undergoing reoperation was 22 months compared with 13 months for those who did not have further surgery (P < 0.02). Thirty-five percent of patients relapsed locally within the brachytherapy target volume, whereas 65% had marginal or distant relapses.

However, patients have then usually undergone multimodal treatment, which makes it difficult to specifically validate GKS independent of established treatments. Thus, we developed an experimental brain tumor model to assess the efficacy and radiotoxicity associated with GKS. Methods: GBM xenografts were implanted intracerebrally in nude rats, and engraftment was confirmed with MRI. The rats were allocated to GKS, with margin doses of 12 Gy or 18 Gy, or to no treatment. Survival time was recorded, tumor sections were examined, and radiotoxicity was evaluated in a behavioral open field test. Results: In the first series, survival from the time of implantation was 96 days in treated rats and 72 days in controls (P < 0.001). In a second experiment, survival was 72 days in the treatment group versus 54 days in controls (P < 0.006). Polynuclear macrophages and fibrosis was seen in groups subjected to GKS. Untreated rats with GBM xenografts displayed less mobility than GKS-treated animals in the open field test 4 weeks after treatment (P = 0.04).

"""Noninvasive imaging of apoptosis and its application in cancer therapeutics.""","""Purpose: Activation of the apoptotic cascade plays an important role in the response of tumors to therapy. Noninvasive imaging of apoptosis facilitates optimization of therapeutic protocols regarding dosing and schedule and enables identification of efficacious combination therapies. Experimental design: We describe a hybrid polypeptide that reports on caspase-3 activity in living cells and animals in a noninvasive manner. This reporter, ANLucBCLuc, constitutes a fusion of small interacting peptides, peptide A and peptide B, with the NLuc and CLuc fragments of luciferase with a caspase-3 cleavage site (DEVD) between pepANLuc (ANLuc) and pepBCLuc (BCLuc). During apoptosis, caspase-3 cleaves the reporter, enabling separation of ANLuc from BCLuc. A high-affinity interaction between peptide A and peptide B restores luciferase activity by NLuc and CLuc complementation. Using a D54 glioma model, we show the utility of the reporter in imaging of apoptosis in living subjects in response to various chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens. Results: Treatment of live cells and mice carrying D54 tumor xenografts with chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide and perifosine resulted in induction of bioluminescence activity, which correlated with activation of caspase-3. Treatment of mice with combination therapy of temozolomide and radiation resulted in increased bioluminescence activity over individual treatments and increased therapeutic response due to enhanced apoptosis. Conclusion: The data provided show the utility of the ANLucBCLuc reporter in dynamic, noninvasive imaging of apoptosis and provides a rationale for use of this technology to optimize dose and schedule of novel therapies or to develop novel combination therapies using existing drugs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18413842

The aberrant vasculature leads to hypoxic areas and results in an increase in oxidative stress, selecting for more invasive tumour cell phenotypes. In our study, we assay in silico different therapeutic approaches which combine antithrombotics (ATs), antioxidants and standard radiotherapy (RT). To do so, we have developed a biocomputational model of GBM that incorporates the spatio-temporal interplay among two glioma cell phenotypes corresponding to oxygenated and hypoxic cells, a necrotic core and the local vasculature whose response evolves with tumour progression. Our numerical simulations predict that suitable combinations of ATs and antioxidants may diminish, in a synergistic way, oxidative stress and the subsequent hypoxic response.

"""Differentiating Tumor Progression from Pseudoprogression in Patients with Glioblastomas Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI.""","""Background and purpose: Early assessment of treatment response is critical in patients with glioblastomas. A combination of DTI and DSC perfusion imaging parameters was evaluated to distinguish glioblastomas with true progression from mixed response and pseudoprogression. Materials and methods: Forty-one patients with glioblastomas exhibiting enhancing lesions within 6 months after completion of chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent surgery after MR imaging and were histologically classified as having true progression (>75% tumor), mixed response (25%-75% tumor), or pseudoprogression (<25% tumor). Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, planar anisotropy coefficient, spheric anisotropy coefficient, and maximum relative cerebral blood volume values were measured from the enhancing tissue. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the best model for classification of true progression from mixed response or pseudoprogression. Results: Significantly elevated maximum relative cerebral blood volume, fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, and planar anisotropy coefficient and decreased spheric anisotropy coefficient were observed in true progression compared with pseudoprogression (P < .05). There were also significant differences in maximum relative cerebral blood volume, fractional anisotropy, planar anisotropy coefficient, and spheric anisotropy coefficient measurements between mixed response and true progression groups. The best model to distinguish true progression from non-true progression (pseudoprogression and mixed) consisted of fractional anisotropy, linear anisotropy coefficient, and maximum relative cerebral blood volume, resulting in an area under the curve of 0.905. This model also differentiated true progression from mixed response with an area under the curve of 0.901. A combination of fractional anisotropy and maximum relative cerebral blood volume differentiated pseudoprogression from nonpseudoprogression (true progression and mixed) with an area under the curve of 0.807.

At present, no chemotherapy has appeared to influence its prognosis. On the other hand, recent advances in brain tumor biology have suggested that brain tumor growth is at least in part under a neuroendocrine control, mainly realized by opioid peptides and pineal substances. On this basis, we evaluated the influence of a concomitant administration of the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) in patients with glioblastoma treated with radical or adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). The study included 30 patients with glioblastoma, who were randomized to receive RT alone (60 Gy) or RT plus MLT (20 mg/daily orally) until disease progression. Both the survival curve and the percent of survival at 1 year were significantly higher in patients treated with RT plus MLT than in those receiving RT alone (6/14 vs. 1/16). Moreover, RT or steroid therapy-related toxicities were lower in patients concomitantly treated with MLT.

The prognostic role of EGFRvIII in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients and changes in EGFRvIII expression in recurrent versus primary glioblastomas remain controversial, but such data are highly relevant for EGFRvIII-targeted therapies.Experimental Design:EGFR-amplified glioblastomas from 106 patients were assessed for EGFRvIII positivity. Changes in EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII status from primary to recurrent glioblastomas were evaluated in 40 patients with EGFR-amplified tumors and 33 patients with EGFR-nonamplified tumors. EGFR single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were assessed in 27 patients. Data were correlated with outcome and validated in 150 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium.Results: Sixty of 106 EGFR-amplified glioblastomas were EGFRvIII-positive (56.6%). EGFRvIII positivity was not associated with different progression-free or overall survival. EGFRvIII status was unchanged at recurrence in 35 of 40 patients with EGFR-amplified primary tumors (87.5%). Four patients lost and one patient gained EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. None of 33 EGFR-nonamplified glioblastomas acquired EGFR amplification or EGFRvIII at recurrence. EGFR SNVs were frequent in EGFR-amplified tumors, but were not linked to survival.Conclusions: EGFRvIII and EGFR SNVs are not prognostic in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma patients. EGFR amplification is retained in recurrent glioblastomas. Most EGFRvIII-positive glioblastomas maintain EGFRvIII positivity at recurrence. However, EGFRvIII expression may change in a subset of patients at recurrence, thus repeated biopsy with reassessment of EGFRvIII status is recommended for patients with recurrent glioblastoma to receive EGFRvIII-targeting agents.

Of seven patients in whom histological diagnoses were eventually obtained, four proved to have glioblastomas and three low-grade astrocytomas. Autopsy revealed that all glioblastomatous tumors extended beyond the treatment field; this suggested that larger volumes, perhaps the whole brain, should be irradiated.

"""Heat-shock protein vaccines as active immunotherapy against human gliomas.""","""Modern advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to the development of active immunotherapy that utilizes tumor-associated antigens to induce a specific immune response against the tumor. Current methods of immunotherapy implementation are based on the principle that tumor-associated antigens are capable of being processed by antigen-presenting cells and inducing an activated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-specific immune response that targets the tumor cells. Antigen internalization and processing by antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, or macrophages results in their surface association with MHC class I molecules, which can be recognized by an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte adaptive immune response. With the aim of augmenting current immunotherapeutic modalities, much effort has been directed towards enhancing antigen-presenting cell activation and optimizing the processing of tumor-associated antigens and major histocompatibility molecules. The goal of these immunotherapy modifications is to ultimately improve the adaptive specific immune response in killing of tumor cells while sparing normal tissues. Immunotherapy has been actively studied and applied in glioblastomas. Preclinical animal models have shown the feasibility of an active immunotherapy approach through the utilization of tumor vaccines, and recently several clinical studies have also been initiated. Recently, endogenous heat-shock proteins have been implicated in the mediation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses. They are now being investigated as a potential modality and adjuvant to immunotherapy, and they represent a promising novel treatment for human glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19895242

"""Interstitial thermoradiotherapy of brain tumors: preliminary results of a phase I clinical trial.""","""A Phase I clinical trial has been initiated to determine the feasibility, tolerance, and toxicity of interstitial thermoradiotherapy in the treatment of high-grade supratentorial brain gliomas. Hyperthermia was delivered by means of thermally-regulating ferromagnetic implants afterloaded into stereotactically placed plastic catheters. Heat treatments were given immediately before interstitial irradiation; in addition, five patients received a second heat treatment at the completion of brachytherapy. The desired target temperature for the 60-minute hyperthermia session was between 42 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Following hyperthermia, the catheters were afterloaded with Ir-192, which delivered a variable radiation dose of 14-50 Gy depending on the clinical situation. Interstitial irradiation was supplemented with external beam radiotherapy (40-41.4 Gy) in patients with previously untreated tumors. A total of 14 patients (4 males, 10 females) have been treated to date on this protocol. Eleven of the patients had a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme, whereas three had anaplastic astrocytoma. The mean implant volume was 61.5 cm3 (range: 9-119 cm3); the median number of interstitial treatment catheters implanted was 19 (range: 7-33). Continuous temperature monitoring was performed by means of multisensor thermocouple probes inserted in the center as well as in the periphery of the tumor. Of the 175 monitored intratumoral points, 83 (47%) had time-averaged mean temperatures of greater than 42 degrees C, and only 12 sensors (7%) exceeded a temperature of 45 degrees C. Among the 19 heat treatments attempted, there have been four minor acute toxicities, all of which resolved with conservative medical management and one major complication resulting in the demise of a patient.

Twelve patients underwent biopsy and eleven underwent surgical decompression. The median tumor volume for the biopsy group was 60.6 cm(3) and for the surgically decompressed group 40.5 cm(3). In the biopsy group, five patients received adjuvant therapy but one died prior to its completion; two died prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy and five were lost to follow up. In the surgical decompression group, seven patients received adjuvant therapy, one died prior to the initiation of adjuvant therapy, two were treated with palliative measures only, and one was lost to follow up. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall median post surgical-survival of the whole group was 180 days, the biopsy group 48 days, and the surgically decompressed group 265 days (p = 0.14). Our results show that there was a higher median survival in the surgically decompressed group; but a direct correlation could not be established, and that the median KPS did not improve in either group after treatment.

Clinical data are sparse due to its limited application until now and the value of this approach for tumour control and survival time remain to be defined. Twenty-four patients (7 low-grade gliomas, 11 anaplastic gliomas, 6 glioblastomas) with brain tumours, most recurrences, were treated with SLITT, in total 30 laser procedures were performed. Under local anaesthesia a 600 micro m laser-fiber was inserted by the stereotactic-guided technique. In open low-field MR the denaturation of the tumour by a Nd-YAG-laser (1064 nm) was monitored using T 1 -weighted 3-D turbo FLASH sequences. The ablation procedure had to be stopped twice because of neurological deficit, one major infection occurred. In two cases neurological improvement was observed. Mean survival times for low grade astrocytomas, anaplastic gliomas and glioblastomas were 144 months, 39 months, 17 months, respectively. Mean survival times after SLITT were 34 months, 30 months and 9 months, respectively. Mean times to progression after SLITT for the 3 histological subgroups were 16 months, 10 months and 4 months, respectively. Five patients with low grade astrocytoma and a KI greater or equal 70 maintained a high quality functional status for 11, 20, 21, 33 and 43 months. In anaplastic tumours patients maintained a KI of 70 for a median time of 15 months and for those with glioblastoma the respective high quality duration was 7.5 months after SLITT. SLITT for selected patients with glioma could have a clinical value in a multimodality treatment schedule maintaining quality of live. Due to the minimal invasive technique, the method is a therapy of choice and may be favoured to reoperation.

"""The antitumorigenic response of neural precursors depends on subventricular proliferation and age.""","""Glioblastomas, the most aggressive primary brain tumors, occur almost exclusively in adult patients. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) are antitumorigenic in mice, as they can migrate to glioblastomas and induce tumor cell death. Here, we show that the antitumor effect of NPCs is age-dependently controlled by cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and that NPCs accumulating at a glioblastoma are diverted from their normal migratory path to the olfactory bulb. Experimentally induced cortical glioblastomas resulted in decreased subventricular proliferation in adult (postnatal day 90) but not in young (postnatal day 30) mice. Adult mice supplied fewer NPCs to glioblastomas and had larger tumors than young mice. Apart from the difference in proliferation, there was neither a change in cell number and death rate in the SVZ nor a change in angiogenesis and immune cell density in the tumors. The ability to kill glioblastomas was similar in NPCs isolated from young and adult mice. The proliferative response of NPCs to glioblastomas depended on the expression of D-type cyclins. In young mice, NPCs express the cyclins D1 and D2, but the expression of cyclin D1 is lost during aging, and in adult NPCs only cyclin D2 remains. In young and adult cyclin D2-deficient mice we observed a reduced supply of NPCs to glioblastomas and the generation of larger tumors compared with wild-type mice. We conclude that cyclin D1 and D2 are nonredundant for the antitumor response of subventricular NPCs. Loss of a single D-type cyclin results in a smaller pool of proliferating NPCs, lower number of NPCs migrating to the tumor, and reduced antitumor activity.

"""Extent of tumor-brain interface: a new tool to predict evolution of malignant gliomas.""","""Object: Tumor size is one of the features commonly used in oncology to predict disease evolution. However, for most primary brain tumors it is not predictive of outcome. Taking advantage of a gene therapy trial in which recurrences of glioblastoma were targeted with suicide genes, the authors developed a new parameter: the extent of tumor-brain interface--also called surface of tumor volume (STV)--to better describe three-dimensional conformation and the relationship between tumors and the surrounding normal tissue. Correlations between the STV and the usual clinical parameters were analyzed. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, 16 patients presenting with recurrent glioblastomas were enrolled in this study. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were analyzed on a separate workstation; the interface between tumor and normal brain tissue was measured on each 3-mm-thick section to assess STV. The mean STV was 29.2 cm2, and the mean tumor volume (TV) was 23.8 cm3. The STV was significantly correlated with survival (Spearman test: r = -0.54, p = 0.03), but TV was not (Spearman test: r = -0.39, p = 0.15). A separate analysis of responding and nonresponding patients showed that, as expected, STV was negatively correlated with survival among nonresponding patients (p = 0.04), but that among responding patients there was a positive tendency between STV and survival. Conclusions: These findings indicate that STV may be a useful tool for predicting the evolution of malignant glioma. Moreover, in future gene therapy trials in which such in situ approaches are used, increasing density and improved distribution of transfer cells should be taken into consideration as an important issue for efficacy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11235948

It has often been assumed that the most aggressive histologic component of a tumor determines biologic behavior; however in this trial, the survival of patients who had mixed glioblastomas/oligodenrogliomas was significantly longer than that of patients with pure glioblastomas (GBM). We therefore evaluated the effect of an oligodendroglial component on the survival of patients who had anaplastic astrocytomas (AAF) treated in the same trial. Methods and materials: One hundred nine patients who had AAF and 24 patients with mixed AAF/oligodendrogliomas (AAF/OL) were enrolled in a Phase I/II trial of randomized dose-escalation hyperfractioned radiotherapy plus BCNU. AAF/OL patients were older and more likely to have had more aggressive surgery than AAF patients. Other pretreatment characteristics were balanced between groups, as was assigned treatment. Results: The median survival time for AAF was 3.0 years versus 7.3 years for AAF/OL (p = 0.019). In a multivariate analysis, adjusting for extent of surgical resection and age, an oligodendroglial component was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusion: The results support the concept that AAFs with an oligodendroglial component have a better prognosis than pure AAF tumors, similar to the effect seen among patients with glioblastoma multiforme tumors. This better survival outcome should be taken into consideration in the design and stratification of future trials. Additionally, in contrast to patients with GBMs, patients who have AAF/OL have the potential for prolonged survival; therefore, late sequelae of treatment (both radiation and chemotherapy) must be weighed more heavily in the benefits to risks analysis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9276354

Agents able to redifferentiate neoplastic cells in vitro are known. We proposed alfacalcidol, a vitamin D analog able to bind to nuclear receptors regulating mitotic activity, in the treatment of malignant gliomas. Patients and methods: Patients with glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas were enrolled in a phase II trial involving surgery or biopsy, radiotherapy (64 Gy), chemotherapy with VM26-CCNU or fotemustine, and alfacalcidol at the daily dose of 0.04 microg/kg. MRI took place every 6 months. Results: Eleven patients were included and completed the study. The series involved 10 glioblastomas and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma. Three patients out of 11 patients (27%), 2 glioblastomas and 1 astrocytoma grade III, exhibited a particular response, consisting in the progressive regression of the radiological lesion, with a decrease of the gadolinium-enhanced area. Simultaneously, the patients showed a complete clinical remission, observed respectively for 7, 5 and 4 years. In the series of 10 patients with glioblastomas, 2 cases showed this response; after 4 years, 2 of 10 patients with glioblastomas (20%) were alive; the median survival time is 21 months. Normal or subnormal calcemia was observed, at the dose proposed, so that no interruption of the drug was necessary. Conclusions: Alfacalcidol, an in vitro agent of redifferentiation, is safe and seems able to induce in some patients, in synergy with classical surgery-radiotherapy-chemotherapy treatments, a particular progressive and durable regression of the tumor.

Methods: A data base that included 430 patients with glioblastomas and 916 patients with brain metastases who underwent radiotherapy at the author's hospital between 1980 and 2000 was analyzed. Patterns of care were compared for different age groups using the chi-square test. Results: In both patient groups, age turned out to be an independent risk factor. Older age was associated with worse overall survival. Independent of the cut-off age (< 50 years vs. > or = 50 years, < 60 years vs. > or = 60 years, < 65 years vs. > or = 65 years, and < 70 years vs. > or = 70 years), there were no statistically significant differences between the age groups concerning the use of different imaging modalities (computed tomography scans vs. magnetic resonance imaging), type of surgery (none vs. biopsy vs. resection), waiting time for radiotherapy (< median vs. > or = median), radiotherapy treatment planning (simulator-based vs. computer-based), use of radiation sources (cobalt unit vs. linear accelerator), and fractionation protocols (conventional vs. modified). When the recruitment period of 21 years was divided into 3 intervals, impressive changes with regard to the patterns of care became apparent. However, the changes were seen similarly throughout the different age groups. Conclusions: Older age did not limit access to state-of-the-art patterns of care in neurooncology.

Clinical variables considered included gender, age, Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS), extent of surgical resection, adjuvant radiation and survival. Results: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to correlate these variables with MIB1 staining. MIB1 staining does not predict overall survival or response to adjuvant therapy as an independent risk factor.

The mean MGMT activity of untreated GBM was 37 +/- 45 (range 0-205) fmol/mg proteins.

Comparing patients who received RT only with RT plus chemotherapy, a significant increase of MGMT in 1st recurrences was only found after treatment with RT plus chemotherapy, indicating either selection of MGMT expressing cells or induction of the MGMT gene by alkylating agents. The p53 status was not significantly related to the MGMT expression level, although a trend for lower MGMT activity in p53 positively stained tumors was observed. Patients expressing MGMT activity of <or=30 fmol/mg protein in the pretreatment tumor had a significant better therapeutic response than patients expressing MGMT above this level, which was shown by Kaplan-Meyer curves and the recurrence free interval after primary tumor resection. In patients who received RT only, this correlation was not found. The data revealed a threshold of MGMT expression (30 fmol/mg protein) below which patients respond better to alkylating agents. Therefore, determination of MGMT activity in the primary tumor appears to be useful in predicting the outcome of GBM therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18000822

"""Selective sensitivity to radiation of cerebral glioblastomas harboring p53 mutations.""","""Recent studies suggest that a balance may exist between the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing functions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Adenoviral p21 transduction attenuates apoptosis, whereas deletion of the p21 gene promotes it, and p21-null xenografts respond better than isogenic p21-wild type tumors to irradiation. Hence, the role of p53 in dictating the clinical response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be more complex than previously thought. We have analyzed survival and radiation response (regrowth-free period) of 42 patients with glioblastomas whose p53 status was determined by a sensitive yeast functional assay. Multivariate analysis revealed that p53 mutation is associated with longer survival (P < 0.02). Among 36 radiation-treated patients, the regrowth-free period after treatment was significantly longer for tumors with p53 mutations (P < 0.0001), and p53 mutation was the sole independent factor predictive of radiotherapeutic response (P < 0.01). Survival time after regrowth was independent of p53 status, suggesting that the difference in survival was related to the treatment rather than to the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor.

In glioblastomas (histological grade 4, n = 257) the same chemotherapy was evaluated versus two cycles 4 weeks apart of 160 mg lomustine (CCNU) orally instead of BCNU, combined with vincristine and procarbazine (PCV) versus no chemotherapy. All patients in both groups received radiotherapy. Among glioblastoma patients < 55 years of age there was a significant (P = 0.03), but moderately increased survival in the i.a.BCNU-PV group versus the two other arms that did not differ from each other. This difference could be explained by an uneven distribution of prognostic factors, especially age group (< 50 years versus 50-54 years) in favour of the i.a.BCNU-PV group. In anaplastic gliomas, the median survival in the i.a.BCNU-PV group was 80 months versus 25 months for the no chemotherapy arm (P = 0.004). No significant differences in the distribution of prognostic factors were found between the two therapy arms. We suggest that the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in glioblastomas is unclear, while i.a.BCNU-PV as adjuvant chemotherapy among patients < 55 years of age and with anaplastic gliomas increased survival markedly.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9893629
"""Accumulation of CD133-positive glioma cells after high-dose irradiation by Gamma Knife surgery plus external beam radiation.""","""Object: Recent evidence suggests that a glioma stem cell subpopulation might contribute to radioresistance in malignant gliomas. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors examined recurrent malignant gliomas for histopathological changes after high-dose irradiation with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Methods: Thirty-two patients with malignant gliomas (Grade 3 in 8 patients, Grade 4 in 24) underwent GKS in combination with EBRT. Serial MR and L-[methyl-(11)C] methionine PET images were employed to assess remnant or recurrent tumors after GKS. Twelve patients underwent surgical removal after GKS and EBRT. Histological sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry for MIB-1, factor VIII, and stem cell markers, nestin and CD133. Results: The site of GKS treatment failure was local in 16 (76.2%) of 21 patients with glioblastomas showing progression; in 9 of these 16 patients, the recurrence clearly arose within the target lesion of GKS. Histopathological examination after GKS and EBRT showed variable mixtures of viable tumor tissues and necrosis. Viable tumor tissues exhibited high MIB-1 indices but reduced numbers of tumor blood vessels. There was marked accumulation of CD133-positive glioma cells, particularly in remnant tumors within the necrotic areas, in sections obtained after GKS plus EBRT, whereas CD133-positive cells appeared very infrequently in primary sections prior to adjuvant treatment. Conclusions: The results indicate that CD133-positive glioma stemlike cells can survive high-dose irradiation, leading to recurrence, despite prolonged damage to tumor blood vessels. This could be an essential factor limiting the effectiveness of GKS plus EBRT for malignant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20205512

The authors therefore retrospectively characterized the clinical behavior and pathological features of these tumors. A review of the database at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada revealed four patients with cerebellar tumors that displayed significant pleomorphism, hypercellularity, mitoses, and necrosis with pseudopalisading. The authors performed a detailed clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors in these four children (three boys and one girl; average age at presentation 7 years; range 21 months-15 years). Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography most commonly revealed a large lesion with minimal edema, inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, and a discrete border. Tumor resection was subtotal in one patient and gross total in three patients. Immunostaining of the tumor cells with antisera to glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin was positive in varying degrees. Initial adjuvant therapy consisted of local radiation only (one patient), chemotherapy only (one patient), and radiation and chemotherapy (one patient). One patient received no adjuvant therapy. Tumor recurrence was documented in all patients: two local recurrences (at 3.5 and 7 months), one spinal recurrence (at 14 months), and one local recurrence with ventricular and spinal spread (at 8 months). Ultimately, three of the four patients developed leptomeningeal tumor spread. Patient follow up ranged from 8 to 17 months (mean 12.5 months). Three patients were dead at last follow up with a mean survival of 15 months.

Whether a correlation can be confirmed between data from 1HMRS and quantitative histomorphology of glioblastomas representing the most frequent type of brain tumors was investigated in the present study. Furthermore, it was of interest, whether correlations between spectroscopic data and histomorphology can be confirmed for proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei independently. Using stringent inclusion criteria for this study, 24 patients were investigated by means of preoperative 1HMRS and by means of digital image analysis of paraffin sections from the surgical specimen. Proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei were investigated separately in the region with the highest proliferative activity in each tumor using immunohistological staining for the proliferation marker Ki67. Main results showed highly significant correlations between total creatine and variables of nuclear size, as well as correlations between choline and variables of nuclear shape. These results were confirmed for both proliferating and non-proliferating tumor cell nuclei. A significant correlation between N-acetyl-aspartate level and topometric variables (number of neighbors per nucleus, variables describing distances between tumor cell nuclei) was confirmed for proliferating tumor cell nuclei. Discriminant analysis provided a good separation of cases with high and with low values for these spectroscopic variables based on histomorphometric data.

Immunohistochemistry was carried out using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Aurora-A expression was higher in tumors with high Ki-67 expression (p=0.01) and was positively, though marginally, related to aurora-B expression (p=0.085). Aurora-B expression was not linked to Ki-67 expression (p=0.182).

Therefore, we investigated the impact of an additional simultaneous chemotherapy with the topoisomerase-I inhibitor topotecan (Hycamtin) on the quality of life and toxicity of radiotherapy. Patients and methods: In this multicenter trial patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme underwent a simultaneous radio-chemotherapy. Including pilot phase 60 patients, 41 male and 19 female, were treated. Age ranged from 26 to 76 years, the mean was 57 years. Conventional fractionated conformal radiotherapy was performed with daily doses of 2.0 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy. 1 hour prior to irradiation 0.5 mg (absolute dose) of topotecan were administered intravenously resulting in a cumulative dose of 15 mg. Besides hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, quality of life was assessed by Karnofsky index and Spitzer index. Additionally local control and survival time were recorded. Results: 57 patients completed the combined therapy. Median administered dose of radiation was 60 Gy (16-76 Gy). Median cumulative topotecan dose was 15 mg (7.5-18.5 mg). Grade-III toxicity was found in six cases (two hematologic, two motoric disorder, one infection, one nausea) and grade-IV toxicity in three cases (one esophagitis, one motoric disorder, one mental disorder). Two patients died of septic disease most likely caused by steroid induced immunosuppression. Mean Karnofsky index and Spitzer index initially, at the end of therapy and 6 weeks after therapy showed values of 87%, 81% and 80% and 19 points, 18 points and 19 points, respectively.

To date, no therapies have demonstrated substantial survival benefit beyond standard of care. An expanding understanding of the role of the immune system in fighting cancer has led to the development and approval of various immunotherapeutic approaches across solid tumors. In glioblastoma, the notion of a highly immune-restricted central nervous system has also evolved, further providing the rationale for testing therapies that promote immune trafficking to the CNS and infiltration into the tumor to counteract the immunosuppressive mechanisms that support tumor progression. There are five broad categories of immunotherapies currently being tested in GBM: vaccines, cytokine therapy, oncolytic viral therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, and checkpoint inhibitors. This review focuses on checkpoint inhibitors in GBM, the rationale for its use, preclinical data, and early clinical experience. Efficacy data are limited, and while a number of late-stage trials are ongoing, early trials showed no benefit in survival.

Patients receive surgery and chemoradiotherapy but tumors almost always fatally recur. Results: Using RNA sequencing data from 107 pairs of pre- and post-standard treatment locally recurrent IDHwt GBM tumors, we identify two responder subtypes based on longitudinal changes in gene expression. In two thirds of patients, a specific subset of genes is upregulated from primary to recurrence (Up responders), and in one third, the same genes are downregulated (Down responders), specifically in neoplastic cells. Characterization of the responder subtypes indicates subtype-specific adaptive treatment resistance mechanisms that are associated with distinct changes in the tumor microenvironment. In Up responders, recurrent tumors are enriched in quiescent proneural GBM stem cells and differentiated neoplastic cells, with increased interaction with the surrounding normal brain and neurotransmitter signaling, whereas Down responders commonly undergo mesenchymal transition. ChIP-sequencing data from longitudinal GBM tumors suggests that the observed transcriptional reprogramming could be driven by Polycomb-based chromatin remodeling rather than DNA methylation. Conclusions: We show that the responder subtype is cancer-cell intrinsic, recapitulated in in vitro GBM cell models, and influenced by the presence of the tumor microenvironment.

The standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy after maximal safe resection; however, the optimal timing of such therapy is poorly defined. Given the lack of consensus in the literature, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to investigate the effect of time from surgery to initiation of therapy on survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS Patients with primary glioblastoma diagnosed since 2005 and treated according to the standard of care were identified from TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between groups stratified by postoperative delay to initiation of radiation treatment. RESULTS There were 218 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with known time to initiation of radiotherapy identified in the database. The median duration until therapy was 27 days. Delay to radiotherapy longer than the median was not associated with worse PFS (HR = 0.918, p = 0.680) or OS (HR = 1.135, p = 0.595) in multivariate analysis when controlling for age, sex, KPS score, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in the highest and lowest quartiles for delay to therapy (≤ 20 days vs ≥ 36 days) did not statistically differ in PFS (p = 0.667) or OS (p = 0.124).

Given the high mortality rate and fast-growing nature of gliomas, patients often have to make significant and consequential decisions in relatively short periods of time, such as consent for treatments and personal planning (e.g., preparing a will, assigning power of attorney). In a postmortem context, forensic psychiatrists may have to make determinations regarding whether a person had capacity at the time many of these decisions were made.

The earlier clinical failures with BNCT related directly to the lack of tissue penetration by neutron beams and to boron compounds that showed little specificity for and low retention by tumor cells, while attaining high concentrations in blood.

The resulting AMNP@CLP@CCM can successfully cross the BBB and deliver CLP002 to GBM tissues due to the homing effect of CCM. As a natural photothermal conversion agent, AMNPs are used for tumor PTT. The increased local temperature by PTT not only enhances BBB penetration but also upregulates the PD-L1 level on GBM cells. Importantly, PTT can effectively stimulate immunogenic cell death to induce tumor-associated antigen exposure and promote T lymphocyte infiltration, which can further amplify the antitumor immune responses of GBM cells to CLP002-mediated ICB therapy, resulting in significant growth inhibition of the orthotopic GBM. Therefore, AMNP@CLP@CCM has great potential for the treatment of orthotopic GBM by PTT and ICB synergistic therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The effect of ICB therapy on GBM is limited by the low immunogenicity and insufficient T-cell infiltration. Here we developed a biomimetic nanoplatform of AMNP@CLP@CCM for GBM-targeted PTT and ICB synergistic therapy. In this nanoplatform, AMNPs are used as both photothermal conversion agents for PTT and nanocarriers for CLP002 delivery. PTT not only enhances BBB penetration but also upregulates the PD-L1 level on GBM cells by increasing local temperature. Additionally, PTT also induces tumor-associated antigen exposure and promotes T lymphocyte infiltration to amplify the antitumor immune responses of GBM cells to CLP002-mediated ICB therapy, resulting in significant growth inhibition of the orthotopic GBM. Thus, this nanoplatform holds great potential for orthotopic GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37236575

"""Concept of a fully-implantable system to monitor tumor recurrence.""","""Current treatment for glioblastoma includes tumor resection followed by radiation, chemotherapy, and periodic post-operative examinations. Despite combination therapies, patients face a poor prognosis and eventual recurrence, which often occurs at the resection site. With standard MRI imaging surveillance, histologic changes may be overlooked or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions about the course of adjuvant therapy and subsequent interventions. To address these challenges, we propose an implantable system for accurate continuous recurrence monitoring that employs optical sensing of fluorescently labeled cancer cells and is implanted in the resection cavity during the final stage of tumor resection. We demonstrate the feasibility of the sensing principle using miniaturized system components, optical tissue phantoms, and porcine brain tissue in a series of experimental trials. Subsequently, the system electronics are extended to include circuitry for wireless energy transfer and power management and verified through electromagnetic field, circuit simulations and test of an evaluation board. Finally, a holistic conceptual system design is presented and visualized. This novel approach to monitor glioblastoma patients is intended to early detect recurrent cancerous tissue and enable personalization and optimization of therapy thus potentially improving overall prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37773315
"""Percent change of perfusion skewness and kurtosis: a potential imaging biomarker for early treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: To test the predictive value of skewness and kurtosis changes of normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) during the early treatment period for differentiating early tumor progression from pseudoprogression in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas. Materials and methods: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. The authors assessed 135 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas who underwent concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CCRT) after surgical resection. Patients who developed new or enlarged contrast material-enhanced lesions after CCRT were assessed by means of conventional and perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The percent change of skewness and kurtosis on nCBV histograms between the first and second post-CCRT follow-up were classified into four categories. Independent predictors of early tumor progression were determined by means of logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 135 patients, 79 had new or enlarged contrast-enhanced lesions after CCRT, subsequently classified as early tumor progression (n = 42, 53.2%) and pseudoprogression (n = 37, 46.8%). Pseudoprogression was observed in 23 of 24 (95.8%) patients in category 1, 10 of 15 (66.7%) in category 2, four of 20 (20.0%) in category 3, and 0 of 20 (0%) in category 4 (χ(2) test, P < .0001). The histographic pattern of nCBV was the best independent predictor (odds ratio, 3.51; P = .0032) for early tumor progression, rather than each percent change of skewness or kurtosis; the histographic pattern of nCBV represented the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.934; 95% confidence interval: 0.855, 0.977), with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 89.2%. Conclusion: The percent change of skewness and kurtosis of nCBV may be a potential imaging biomarker for early treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22771885
"""Graphene nanomesh promises extremely efficient in vivo photothermal therapy.""","""Reduced graphene oxide nanomesh (rGONM), as one of the recent structures of graphene with a surprisingly strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, is used for achieving ultraefficient photothermal therapy. First, by using TiO2 nanoparticles, graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) are transformed into GONMs through photocatalytic degradation. Then rGONMs functionalized by polyethylene glycol (PEG), arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-based peptide, and cyanine 7 (Cy7) are utilized for in vivo tumor targeting and fluorescence imaging of human glioblastoma U87MG tumors having αν β3 integrin receptors, in mouse models. The rGONM-PEG suspension (1 μg mL(-1) ) exhibits about 4.2- and 22.4-fold higher NIR absorption at 808 nm than rGONP-PEG and graphene oxide (GO) with lateral dimensions of ≈60 nm and ≈2 μm. In vivo fluorescence imaging demonstrates high selective tumor uptake of rGONM-PEG-Cy7-RGD in mice bearing U87MG cells. The excellent NIR absorbance and tumor targeting of rGONM-PEG-Cy7-RGD results in an ultraefficient photothermal therapy (100% tumor elimination 48 h after intravenous injection of an ultralow concentration (10 μg mL(-1) ) of rGONM-PEG-Cy7-RGD followed by irradiation with an ultralow laser power (0.1 W cm(-2) ) for 7 min), whereas the corresponding rGO- and rGONP-based composites do not present remarkable treatments under the same conditions. All the mice treated by rGONM-PEG-Cy7-RGD survived over 100 days, whereas the mice treated by other usual rGO-based composites were dead before 38 days.

"""Nose-to-brain co-delivery of drugs for glioblastoma treatment using nanostructured system.""","""Mutations on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induction of angiogenesis, and reprogramming cellular energetics are all biological features acquired by tumor cells during tumor development, and also known as the hallmarks of cancer. Targeted therapies that combine drugs that are capable of acting against such concepts are of great interest, since they can potentially improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatments of complex pathologies, such as glioblastoma (GBM). However, the anatomical location and biological behavior of this neoplasm imposes great challenges for targeted therapies. A novel strategy that combines alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab (CTX), both carried onto a nanotechnology-based delivery system, is herein proposed for GBM treatment via nose-to-brain delivery. The biological performance of Poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)/chitosan nanoparticles (NP), loaded with CHC, and conjugated with CTX by covalent bonds (conjugated NP) were extensively investigated. The NP platforms were able to control CHC release, indicating that drug release was driven by the Weibull model. An ex vivo study with nasal porcine mucosa demonstrated the capability of these systems to promote CHC and CTX permeation. Blot analysis confirmed that CTX, covalently associated to NP, impairs EGRF activation. The chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay demonstrated a trend of tumor reduction when conjugated NP were employed. Finally, images acquired by fluorescence tomography evidenced that the developed nanoplatform was effective in enabling nose-to-brain transport upon nasal administration. In conclusion, the developed delivery system exhibited suitability as an effective novel co-delivery approaches for GBM treatment upon intranasal administration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34015380

Systems medicine approach is a rather novel strategy, and since the GBM of a patient is complex and unique, thus to devise an individualized treatment strategy to tailor personalized multimodal treatments for the individual patient taking into account the phenotype of the GBM, the unique body health profile of the patient and individual responses according to the systems medicine concept might show potential to achieve optimum effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36859639
"""Multifocal glioblastoma multiforme in the posterior fossa mimicking cerebral metastases: case presentation and review of the current literature.""","""Objective: In general, glioblastomas multiforme (GBM) arise in the supratentorial region, but in less than 4% of cases they also occur in the posterior fossa, particularly in the cerebellum. Furthermore, a minority of malignant gliomas are multifocal. We report on an unusual case with infratentorial multifocal lesions, suspicious for metastases, which turned out to be a multifocal GBM of the posterior fossa. Patient and method: A 69-year-old woman presented with recurring episodes of vertigo, headache, and progressive weight loss. Three multifocal cerebellar and brainstem lesions highly suspicious for metastases were identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Workup for malignancy elsewhere in the body was negative. Results: The patient underwent craniotomy with successful resection of the tumor in the cerebellar vermis with an excellent outcome and uneventful postsurgical course. Histopathology of the tumor revealed features consistent with the diagnosis of GBM and ruled out metastatic lesions. Workup for molecular genetics characterized this tumor as a primary GBM. The patient initially responded to treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide but died after 10 months with a tumor relapse. Conclusion: We discuss the unusual aspects of multifocal primary GBMs in the posterior fossa. Although rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cerebellar tumors, which stresses the importance of a surgical treatment to establish a histological diagnosis because there are no reliable radiographic criteria for distinguishing multifocal infratentorial gliomas from multiple metastases and other tumor entities.

"""Postoperative resveratrol administration improves prognosis of rat orthotopic glioblastomas.""","""Background: Although our previous study revealed lumbar punctured resveratrol could remarkably prolong the survival of rats bearing orthotopic glioblastomas, it also suggested the administration did not completely suppress rapid tumour growth. These evidences led us to consider that the prognosis of tumour-bearing rats may be further improved if this treatment is used in combination with neurosurgery. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the combined treatment on rat orthotopic glioblastomas. Methods: Rat RG2 glioblastoma cells were inoculated into the brains of 36 rats. The rats were subjected to partial tumour removal after they showed symptoms of intracranial hypertension. There were 28 rats that survived the surgery, and these animals were randomly and equally divided into the control group without postoperative treatment and the LP group treated with 100 μl of 300 μM resveratrol via the LP route. Resveratrol was administered 24 h after tumour resection in 3-day intervals, and the animals received 7 treatments. The intracranial tumour sizes, average life span, cell apoptosis and STAT3 signalling were evaluated by multiple experimental approaches in the tumour tissues harvested from both groups. Results: The results showed that 5 of the 14 (35.7%) rats in the LP group remained alive over 60 days without any sign of recurrence. The remaining nine animals had a longer mean postoperative survival time (11.0 ± 2.9 days) than that of the (7.3 + 1.3 days; p < 0.05) control group. The resveratrol-treated tumour tissues showed less Ki67 labelling, widely distributed apoptotic regions, upregulated PIAS3 expression and reduced p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that postoperative resveratrol administration efficiently improves the prognosis of rat advanced orthotopic glioblastoma via inhibition of growth, induction of apoptosis and inactivation of STAT3 signalling.

"""Glioblastoma radiotherapy using Intensity modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) or proton Radiotherapy-GRIPS Trial (Glioblastoma Radiotherapy via IMRT or Proton BeamS): a study protocol for a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, two-arm, phase III study.""","""Background: Radiation therapy is an integral part of the multimodal primary therapy of glioblastomas. As the overall prognosis in this tumor entity remains unfavorable, current research is focused on additional drug therapies, which are often accompanied by increases in toxicity. By using proton beams instead of photon beams, it is possible to protect large parts of the brain which are not affected by the tumor more effectively. An initial retrospective matched-pair analysis showed that this theoretical physical benefit is also clinically associated with a reduction in toxicity during therapy and in the first few months thereafter. Methods/design: The GRIPS trial is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, two-arm, phase III study using either intensity modulated photon radiation techniques (standard arm) or proton beam radiotherapy (experimental arm). Additionally, patients are stratified according to 'fractionation scheme' (normofractionated/hypofractionated), 'subventricular zone involvement' (yes/no) and concurrent chemotherapy (yes/no) and the planned case number is 326 patients. Radiation therapy is performed with a dose of 30 × 2 Gy(RBE) or 33 × 1.8 Gy(RBE), or for patients treated according to the hypofractionation protocol with 15 × 2.67 Gy(RBE). A possible administration of additional chemotherapy (concurrent or adjuvant) or tumor treating fields is applied in dosage and frequency according to the therapy standard outside of this study. The primary endpoint is the cumulative rate of toxicity CTC grade 2 and higher in the first 4 months. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression-free survival, quality of life, and neurocognition.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 141 patients, from a prospectively collected database from 2004-2014, with grade IV glioblastomas who underwent craniotomy and excision. Sixty-five patients were included in our analysis. Twenty patients underwent re-do craniotomy at recurrence and were compared with 45 patients who received nonsurgical therapy for recurrences. Primary end point was overall survival from time of diagnosis. Demographic and disease factors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis for significance. Results: The median survival for those with re-do craniotomy was 25.4 months compared with 11.6 months (P < 0.001) in the group that underwent nonsurgical therapy. The mean age for this group was 53.5 years. This group had a higher postsurgical/treatment median Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) of 80 compared with 60 (P < 0.001) showing better functional outcome. A Cox regression analysis of factors determined that age, KPS at recurrence, extent of resection at initial surgery and re-do craniotomy were significant for positive outcomes.

Signals from next-generation repeat-free FISH interphase probes were identified in tissue microarrays that included 3 spots for each of the 48 cases. The murine double minutes (MDM2)-specific DNA probe and the satellite enumeration probe for chromosome 12 were used. Three cases (6%) showed more than 25 signals (high gene amplification), and 7 (15%) showed 3-10 signals (gains); among these, 4 cases (8%) had an equal number of MDM2 and centromeric signals on chromosome 12 (polyploidy). Genomic heterogeneity was observed only in 3 cases with low gene amplification. In our series, 6% of glioblastomas exhibited high MDM2 amplification (in vivo) with a pattern related to the known double minutes/chromothripsis phenomenon (in situ), and only cases with low amplification showed genomic heterogeneity.

"""Molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its clinical relevance.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common intracranial malignancy and constitutes about 50 % of all gliomas. Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor histological heterogeneity had been recognized by the early 1980-ies. Recent works using novel molecular platforms provided molecular definitions of these tumors. Based on comprehensive genomic sequence analyses, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) cataloged somatic mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in glioblastoma. Robust transcriptome and epigenome studies also revealed inter-tumor heterogeneity. Integration and cluster analyses of multi-dimensional genomic data lead to a new classification of glioblastoma tumors into subtypes with distinct biological features and clinical correlates. However, multiple observations also revealed tumor area-specific patterns of genomic imbalance. In addition, genetic alterations have been identified that were common to all areas analyzed and other alterations that were area specific. Analyses of intra-tumor transcriptome variations revealed that in more than half of the examined cases, fragments from the same tumor mass could be classified into at least two different glioblastoma molecular subgroups. Intra-tumor heterogeneity of molecular genetic profiles in glioblastoma may explain the difficulties encountered in the validation of oncologic biomarkers, and contribute to a biased selection of patients for single target therapies, treatment failure or drug resistance.

Standard RT practice applies the prescription dose uniformly across tumor volume disregarding radiological tumor heterogeneity. We present a novel strategy using diffusion-weighted (DW-) MRI to calculate the cellular density within the gross tumor volume (GTV) in order to facilitate dose escalation to a biological target volume (BTV) to improve tumor control probability (TCP). Methods: The pre-treatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from DW-MRI of ten GBM patients treated with radical chemoradiotherapy were used to calculate the local cellular density based on published data. Then, a TCP model was used to calculate TCP maps from the derived cell density values. The dose was escalated using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the BTV, defined as the voxels for which the expected pre-boost TCP was in the lowest quartile of the TCP range for each patient. The SIB dose was chosen so that the TCP in the BTV increased to match the average TCP of the whole tumor. Results: By applying a SIB of between 3.60 Gy and 16.80 Gy isotoxically to the BTV, the cohort's calculated TCP increased by a mean of 8.44% (ranging from 7.19 to 16.84%). The radiation dose to organ at risk is still under their tolerance. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TCPs of GBM patients could be increased by escalating radiation doses to intratumoral locations guided by the patient's biology (i.e., cellularity), moreover offering the possibility for personalized RT GBM treatments. Advances in knowledge: A personalized and voxel level SIB radiotherapy method for GBM is proposed using DW-MRI, which can increase the tumor control probability and maintain organ at risk dose constraints.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37102792

"""Integrated multiomic analysis reveals disulfidptosis subtypes in glioblastoma: implications for immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges due to its malignancy and limited treatment options. Precision treatment requires subtyping patients based on prognosis. Disulfidptosis, a novel cell death mechanism, is linked to aberrant glucose metabolism and disulfide stress, particularly in tumors expressing high levels of SLC7A11. The exploration of disulfidptosis may provide a new perspective for precise diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma. Methods: Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on samples from GBM patients treated at Tiantan Hospital (January 2022 - December 2023). Data from CGGA and TCGA databases were collected. Consensus clustering based on disulfidptosis features categorized GBM patients into two subtypes (DRGclusters). Tumor immune microenvironment, response to immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity were analyzed. An 8-gene disulfidptosis-based subtype predictor was developed using LASSO machine learning algorithm and validated on CGGA dataset. Results: Patients in DRGcluster A exhibited improved overall survival (OS) compared to DRGcluster B. DRGcluster subtypes showed differences in tumor immune microenvironment and response to immunotherapy. The predictor effectively stratified patients into high and low-risk groups. Significant differences in IC50 values for chemotherapy and targeted therapy were observed between risk groups. Discussion: Disulfidptosis-based classification offers promise as a prognostic predictor for GBM. It provides insights into tumor immune microenvironment and response to therapy. The predictor aids in patient stratification and personalized treatment selection, potentially improving outcomes for GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38504986
"""A novel tool to analyze MRI recurrence patterns in glioblastoma.""","""At least 10% of glioblastoma relapses occur at distant and even contralateral locations. This disseminated growth limits surgical intervention and contributes to neurological morbidity. Preclinical data pointed toward a role for temozolomide (TMZ) in reducing radiotherapy-induced glioma cell invasiveness. Our objective was to develop and validate a new analysis tool of MRI data to examine the clinical recurrence pattern of glioblastomas. MRIcro software was used to map the location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of 63 patients in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981/22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) CE.3 study into the same stereotaxic space. This allowed us to examine changes of site and distance between the initial and the recurrent tumor on the group level. Thirty of the 63 patients were treated using radiotherapy, while the other patients completed a radiotherapy-plus-TMZ treatment. Baseline characteristics (median age, KPS) and outcome data (progression-free survival, overall survival) of the patients included in this analysis resemble those of the general study cohort. The patient groups did not differ in the promoter methylation status of methyl guanine methyltransferase (MGMT). Overall frequency of distant recurrences was 20%. Analysis of recurrence patterns revealed no difference between the groups in the size of the recurrent tumor or in the differential effect on the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location. The data show the feasibility of groupwise recurrence pattern analysis. An effect of TMZ treatment on the recurrence pattern in the EORTC 26981/22981/NCIC CE.3 study could not be demonstrated.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18676355
"""Integrated boost IMRT with FET-PET-adapted local dose escalation in glioblastomas. Results of a prospective phase II study.""","""Purpose: Dose escalations above 60 Gy based on MRI have not led to prognostic benefits in glioblastoma patients yet. With positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18)F]fluorethyl-L-tyrosine (FET), tumor coverage can be optimized with the option of regional dose escalation in the area of viable tumor tissue. Methods and materials: In a prospective phase II study (January 2008 to December 2009), 22 patients (median age 55 years) received radiochemotherapy after surgery. The radiotherapy was performed as an MRI and FET-PET-based integrated-boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The prescribed dose was 72 and 60 Gy (single dose 2.4 and 2.0 Gy, respectively) for the FET-PET- and MR-based PTV-FET((72 Gy)) and PTV-MR((60 Gy)). FET-PET and MRI were performed routinely for follow-up. Quality of life and cognitive aspects were recorded by the EORTC-QLQ-C30/QLQ Brain20 and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), while the therapy-related toxicity was recorded using the CTC3.0 and RTOG scores. Results: Median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 14.8 and 7.8 months, respectively. All local relapses were detected at least partly within the 95% dose volume of PTV-MR((60 Gy)). No relevant radiotherapy-related side effects were observed (excepted alopecia). In 2 patients, a pseudoprogression was observed in the MRI. Tumor progression could be excluded by FET-PET and was confirmed in further MRI and FET-PET imaging. No significant changes were observed in MMSE scores and in the EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-Brain20 questionnaires. Conclusion: Our dose escalation concept with a total dose of 72 Gy, based on FET-PET, did not lead to a survival benefit. Acute and late toxicity were not increased, compared with historical controls and published dose-escalation studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22349712

"""Histologic findings associated with laser interstitial thermotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Background: Laser-interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has been supported by some authors as an ablative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Although the effects of LITT have been modeled in vivo, the histologic effects in a clinical circumstance have not been described. We analyzed tissue from a patient who underwent LITT as primary treatment for GBM. Case presentation: A 62-year-old male was diagnosed with a left temporal GBM and underwent LITT at an outside institution. Despite corticosteroid therapy, the patient was referred with increasing headache and acalculia associated with progressive peritumoral edema two weeks after LITT procedure. En bloc resection of the enhancing lesion and adjacent temporal lobe was performed with steroid-independent symptom resolution (follow-up, > 2 years). Histologic analysis revealed three distinct histologic zones concentrically radiating from the center of the treatment site. An acellular central region of necrosis (Zone 1) was surrounded by a rim of granulation tissue with macrophages (CD68) (Zone 2; mean thickness, 1.3 ± 0.3 mm [±S.D.]). Viable tumor cells (identified by Ki-67, p53 and Olig2 immunohistochemistry) were found (Zone 3) immediately adjacent to granulation tissue. The histologic volume of thermal tissue ablation/granulation was consistent with preoperative (pre-resection) magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging. Conclusion: These findings are the first in vivo in humans to reveal that LITT causes a defined pattern of tissue necrosis, concentric destruction of tumor and tissue with viable tumor cells just beyond the zones of central necrosis and granulation. Furthermore, MR-imaging appears to be an accurate surrogate of tissue/tumor ablation in the early period (2 weeks) post-LITT treatment. Surgery is an effective strategy for patients with post-LITT swelling which does not respond to steroids.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30767775

"""[Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme: a case report].""","""Introduction: Cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme (CGM) accounts for less than 1% of all intracranial glioblastomas; it spreads quickly locally, above all towards the brain stem and adjacent leptomeninges, and has a poor prognosis. Case report: We report the case of a 55 year old patient who presented a continuous feeling of dizziness, instability and sickness, with occasionally vomiting and double vision that had started two months before being admitted to hospital. A physical exploration revealed hypaesthesia of the right side of the face, tactile and algesic hypaesthesia in the left side of the body and nystagmus in the bilateral horizontal gaze. Results of the general physical exploration were normal. A magnetic resonance (MR) brain scan revealed a 3 cm expansive lesion in the middle cerebellar peduncle and right cerebellar hemisphere, which was hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2. Administering contrast showed it to be heterogeneous, with irregular annular enhancement, and perilesional edema. Subtotal excision of the lesion was performed and pathological analysis allowed a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme to be made; radio and chemotherapy were continued. Conclusion: CGM is infrequent and 46.7 years is the mean age of onset. 59% of tumours are located in the hemispheres, they tend to spread locally, and remote metastases have also been reported. Initial clinical manifestations are intracranial hypertension, and gait and balance disorders. Differential diagnosis is provided by MR and includes metastasis, infarction and abscesses. Treatment involves radical surgical excision followed by local radiotherapy. The use of chemotherapy has been reported but its role in the treatment of this entity is still not altogether clear.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15152353
"""Velocity of radial expansion of contrast-enhancing gliomas and the effectiveness of radiotherapy in individual patients: a proof of principle.""","""Aims: The initial aims were to use recently available observations of glioblastomas (as part of a previous study) that had been imaged twice without intervening treatment before receiving radiotherapy in order to obtain quantitative measures of glioma growth and invasion according to a new bio-mathematical model. The results were so interesting as to raise the question whether the degree of radio-sensitivity of each tumour could be estimated by comparing the model-predicted and actual durations of survival and total numbers of glioma cells after radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging volumes were segmented and used to calculate the velocity of radial expansion (v) and the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion/dispersal (D) for each patient according to the bio-mathematical model. Results: The ranges of the values of v, D and rho show that glioblastomas, although clustering at the high end of rates, vary widely one from the other. The effects of X-ray therapy varied from patient to patient. About half survived as predicted without treatment, indicating radio-resistance of these tumours. The other half survived up to about twice as long as predicted without treatment and could have had a corresponding loss of glioma cells, indicating some degree of radio-sensitivity. These results approach the historical estimates that radiotherapy can double survival of the average patient with a glioblastoma. Conclusions: These cases are among the first for which values of v, D and rho have been calculated for glioblastomas. The results constitute a 'proof of principle' by combining our bio-mathematical model for glioma growth and invasion with pre-treatment imaging observations to provide a new tool showing that individual glioblastomas may be identified as having been radio-resistant or radio-sensitive.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18308523
"""Quantitative T1-mapping detects cloudy-enhancing tumor compartments predicting outcome of patients with glioblastoma.""","""Contrast enhancement of glioblastomas (GBM) is caused by the decrease in relaxation time, T1. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative measurement of T1 (qT1) discovers a subtle enhancement in GBM patients that is invisible in standard MRI. We assessed the volume change of this 'cloudy' enhancement during radio-chemotherapy and its impact on patients' progression-free survival (PFS). We enrolled 18 GBM patients in this observational, prospective cohort study and measured 3T-MRI pre- and post contrast agent with standard T1-weighted (T1w) and with sequences to quantify T1 before radiation, and at 6-week intervals during radio-chemotherapy. We measured contrast enhancement by subtracting pre from post contrast contrast images, yielding relative signal increase ∆T1w and relative T1 shortening ∆qT1. On ∆qT1, we identified a solid and a cloudy-enhancing compartment and evaluated the impact of their therapy-related volume change upon PFS. In ∆qT1 maps cloudy-enhancing compartments were found in all but two patients at baseline and in all patients during therapy. The qT1 decrease in the cloudy-enhancing compartment post contrast was 21.64% versus 1.96% in the contralateral control tissue (P < 0.001). It was located at the margin of solid enhancement which was also seen on T1w. In contrast, the cloudy-enhancing compartment was visually undetectable on ∆T1w. A volume decrease of more than 21.4% of the cloudy-enhancing compartment at first follow-up predicted longer PFS (P = 0.038). Cloudy-enhancing compartment outside the solid contrast-enhancing area of GBM is a new observation which is only visually detectable with qT1-mapping and may represent tumor infiltration. Its early volume decrease predicts a longer PFS in GBM patients during standard radio-chemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27891815

Intraoperative MRI, 5-ALA, and neuronavigation are surgical tools that can help achieve a maximal safe resection. Stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy can be used to enhance local control for brain metastases in conjunction with surgery, while combinatorial approaches are increasingly employed in patients with multiple metastases. Advances in surgical techniques allow for minimally invasive approaches, including the use of tubular retractors, endoscopes, and laser interstitial thermal therapy. Primary and metastatic brain tumors require a multimodal, multidisciplinary approach to treatment.

Materials and methods: Oncolytic efficacy of Ad6 was compared to widespread Ad5 both in vitro and in vivo, using the U87 and U251 human glioblastoma cell lines and subcutaneously transplanted U87 cells in SCID mice, respectively. Results: Ad6 had a dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward glioblastoma cells in vitro and its intratumoral injections lead to a significant (p<0.05) decrease in volume of U87 xenografts, similarly to Ad5. Based on the innate capability of glioblastoma cancer stem cells to internalize a fluorescent-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, the spatial localization of these cells was estimated and it was shown that the number of cancer stem cells tended to decrease under adenovirus therapy as compared to the control group.

"""Treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly: a network meta-analysis.""","""Background: A glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour for which the standard of care is maximum surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy, when possible. Age is an important consideration in this disease, as older age is associated with shorter survival and a higher risk of treatment-related toxicity. Objectives: To determine the most effective and best-tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost-effectiveness associated with these approaches. Search methods: We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to 3 April 2019, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to database closure. We handsearched clinical trial registries and selected neuro-oncology society conference proceedings from the past five years. Selection criteria: Randomised trials (RCTs) of treatments for glioblastoma in elderly people. We defined 'elderly' as 70+ years but included studies defining 'elderly' as over 65+ years if so reported. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods for study selection and data extraction. Where sufficient data were available, treatment options were compared in a network meta-analysis (NMA) using Stata software (version 15.1). For outcomes with insufficient data for NMA, pairwise meta-analysis were conducted in RevMan. The GRADE approach was used to grade the evidence. Main results: We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 1818 participants. Six were conducted exclusively among elderly people (either defined as 65 years or older or 70 years or older) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the other six reported data for an elderly subgroup among a broader age range of participants. Most participants were capable of self-care. Study quality was commonly undermined by lack of outcome assessor blinding and attrition. NMA was only possible for overall survival; other analyses were pair-wise meta-analyses or narrative syntheses. Seven trials contributed to the NMA for overall survival, with interventions including supportive care only (one trial arm); hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT40; four trial arms); standard radiotherapy (RT60; five trial arms); temozolomide (TMZ; three trial arms); chemoradiotherapy (CRT; three trial arms); bevacizumab with chemoradiotherapy (BEV_CRT; one trial arm); and bevacizumab with radiotherapy (BEV_RT). Compared with supportive care only, NMA evidence suggested that all treatments apart from BEV_RT prolonged survival to some extent. Overall survival High-certainty evidence shows that CRT prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with RT40 (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.80) and low-certainty evidence suggests that CRT may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ (TMZ versus CRT: HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.98). Low-certainty evidence also suggests that adding BEV to CRT may make little or no difference (BEV_CRT versus CRT: HR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.48 to 1.44). We could not compare the survival effects of CRT with different radiotherapy fractionation schedules (60 Gy/30 fractions and 40 Gy/15 fractions) due to a lack of data. When treatments were ranked according to their effects on OS, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. BEV plus RT was the only treatment for which there was no clear benefit in OS over supportive care only. One trial comparing tumour treating fields (TTF) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (TTF_AC) with adjuvant chemotherapy alone could not be included in the NMA as participants were randomised after receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy, not before. Findings from the trial suggest that the intervention probably improves overall survival in this selected patient population. We were unable to perform NMA for other outcomes due to insufficient data. Pairwise analyses were conducted for the following. Quality of life Moderate-certainty narrative evidence suggests that overall, there may be little difference in QoL between TMZ and RT, except for discomfort from communication deficits, which are probably more common with RT (1 study, 306 participants, P = 0.002). Data on QoL for other comparisons were sparse, partly due to high dropout rates, and the certainty of the evidence tended to be low or very low. Progression-free survival High-certainty evidence shows that CRT increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61); moderate-certainty evidence suggests that RT60 probably increases time to disease progression compared with supportive care only (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.46), and that BEV_RT probably increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 alone (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78). Evidence for other treatment comparisons was of low- or very low-certainty. Severe adverse events Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that TMZ probably increases the risk of grade 3+ thromboembolic events compared with RT60 (risk ratio (RR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.94; participants = 373; studies = 1) and also the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Moderate-certainty evidence also suggests that CRT probably increases the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia compared with hypofractionated RT alone. Adding BEV to CRT probably increases the risk of thromboembolism (RR 16.63, 95% CI 1.00 to 275.42; moderate-certainty evidence). Economic evidence There is a paucity of economic evidence regarding the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly. Only one economic evaluation on two short course radiotherapy regimen (25 Gy versus 40 Gy) was identified and its findings were considered unreliable. Authors' conclusions: For elderly people with glioblastoma who are self-caring, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with RT and may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ alone. For those undergoing RT or TMZ therapy, there is probably little difference in QoL overall. Systemic anti-cancer treatments TMZ and BEV carry a higher risk of severe haematological and thromboembolic events and CRT is probably associated with a higher risk of these events. Current evidence provides little justification for using BEV in elderly patients outside a clinical trial setting. Whilst the novel TTF device appears promising, evidence on QoL and tolerability is needed in an elderly population. QoL and economic assessments of CRT versus TMZ and RT are needed. More high-quality economic evaluations are needed, in which a broader scope of costs (both direct and indirect) and outcomes should be included.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32202316

Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test, while multivariate analysis Cox regression model was used to investigate risk factors for mortality. Results: In this patient cohort, glioblastoma (40%), diffuse glioma (14.6%) and oligodendroglioma (9.6%) were the most common pathological types. The expression of Ki-67 was associated with several clinicopathological parameters (e.g. tumor type, grade, and number of lesions). In addition, Ki-67 correlated with the mortality within the first year of the post-treatment follow-up (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Maier analysis revealed that older patients (≥ 45 years) displayed worse prognosis than those aged under 45 years (P = 0.038). Dismal prognosis was also associated with clinical parameters, including high tumor grade, multiple lesions, and Karnofsky performance score (KPS). Multivariate analysis showed that low KPS (< 85) increased the risk of mortality by 2.3 folds with a 95% CI of 1.141 to 4.776 (P = 0.020). Low tumor grade (grade 1-2) oppositely reduced the mortality risk by 0.22 folds (95% CI, 0.065 to 0.763, P = 0.0168).

"""Neoplastic Myelopathies.""","""Purpose of review: This article discusses the diagnosis and management of neoplasms that affect the spinal cord as well as spinal cord disorders that can occur due to cancer treatments. Recent findings: Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are IDH-mutant tumors, whereas only 10% of glioblastomas are IDH-mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically IDH-mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location. NF2 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome. Summary: Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers.

The study population was randomly assigned into one treatment and one control group. Both groups received radiotherapy followed by six cycles of adjuvant oral temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2)) for 5 days every 28 days after surgery. Prior to radiotherapy, the treatment group also received two cycles, 6 weeks apart, of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with ACNU (40 mg/m(2)/day) and CDDP (40 mg/m(2)/day) infused continuously for 72 h. The primary end-point was median survival time. The study has closed after interim analysis with a total of 82 patients (48.8% of target number) due to unacceptable high frequency of toxicity profiles in spite of the promising actuarial survival outcome. Median survival time was 28.4 months [90% confidence interval (CI), 21.1 months to not available] in the treatment group and 18.9 months (90% CI, 17.1-27.4 months) in the control group (P = 0.2). The 2-year survival rate and progression-free survival time were 50.9% and 6.6 months (90% CI, 3.5-9.5 months) in the treatment group and 27.8% and 5.1 months (90% CI, 3.8-8.8 months) in the control group. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was documented in 26 (68.4%) patients in the treatment group, including three neutropenic fever and one death from sepsis, while grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurred in 6 patients (15.8%) in the control group. The high frequency of serious hematological toxicity with ACNU-CDDP neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide limits its usage as primary treatment for glioblastoma. Future studies should aim to identify a subpopulation at reduced risk for ACNU-CDDP toxicity so that the potential of this protocol can be realized.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21052775
"""Longitudinal analysis of treatment-induced genomic alterations in gliomas.""","""Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) constitutes nearly half of all malignant brain tumors and has a median survival of 15 months. The standard treatment for these lesions includes maximal resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; however, individual tumors display immense variability in their response to these approaches. Genomic techniques such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) provide an opportunity to understand the molecular basis of this variability. Methods: Here, we report WES-guided treatment of a patient with a primary GBM and two subsequent recurrences, demonstrating the dynamic nature of treatment-induced molecular changes and their implications for clinical decision-making. We also analyze the Yale-Glioma cohort, composed of 110 whole exome- or whole genome-sequenced tumor-normal pairs, to assess the frequency of genomic events found in the presented case. Results: Our longitudinal analysis revealed how the genomic profile evolved under the pressure of therapy. Specifically targeted approaches eradicated treatment-sensitive clones while enriching for resistant ones, generated due to chromothripsis, which we show to be a frequent event in GBMs based on our extended analysis of 110 gliomas in the Yale-Glioma cohort. Despite chromothripsis and the later acquired mismatch-repair deficiency, genomics-guided personalized treatment extended survival to over 5 years. Interestingly, the case displayed a favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibition after acquiring mismatch repair deficiency. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the importance of longitudinal genomic profiling to adjust to the dynamic nature of treatment-induced molecular changes to improve the outcomes of precision therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28153049

"""Finite element analysis of Tumor Treating Fields in a patient with posterior fossa glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are alternating electric fields at 200 kHz that disrupt tumor cells as they undergo mitosis. Patient survival benefit has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials but much of the data are available only for supratentorial glioblastomas. We investigated a series of alternative array configurations for the posterior fossa to determine the electric field coverage of a cerebellar glioblastoma. Methods: Semi-automated segmentation of neuro-anatomical structures was performed while the gross tumor volume (GTV) was manually delineated. A three-dimensional finite-element mesh was generated and then solved for field distribution. Results: Compared to the supratentorial array configuration, the alternative array configurations consist of posterior displacement the 2 lateral opposing arrays and inferior displacement of the posteroanterior array, resulting in an average increase of 46.6% electric field coverage of the GTV as measured by the area under the curve of the electric field-volume histogram (EAUC). Hotspots, or regions of interest with the highest 5% of TTFields intensity (E5%), had an average increase of 95.6%. Of the 6 posterior fossa configurations modeled, the PAHorizontal arrangement provided the greatest field coverage at the GTV when the posteroanterior array was placed centrally along the patient's posterior neck and horizontally parallel, along the longer axis, to the coronal plane of the patient's head. Varying the arrays also produced hotspots proportional to TTFields coverage. Conclusions: Our finite element modeling showed that the alternative array configurations offer an improved TTFields coverage to the cerebellar tumor compared to the conventional supratentorial configuration.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31989489
"""[Immunotherapy targeting the Wilms' tumor 1 gene product for patients with malignant brain tumors].""","""In this paper, we review the current status of immunotherapy targeting Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) peptide in malignant brain tumors as well as in other hematological and solid malignancies. WT1 is expressed in various kinds of malignancies, and is involved in oncogenesis. The titers of antibodies against WT1 and the frequency of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were higher in cancer patients than in healthy donors, indicating that WT1 protein has immunogenic function. These findings provided us with a rationale for developing cancer immunotherapy that targets the WT1 peptide. Clinical trials of the WT1 peptide vaccination were initiated, and definite immunological and clinical responses were observed. The disease control rate of 57.1% was obtained especially in the case of recurrent glioblastomas, with a median progression-free survival period of 20.0 weeks and progression-free survival rate at 6 months of 33.3%. The trial showed that WT1 vaccination for malignant gliomas, which is generally believed to be an intractable disease, was safe and elicited a favorable clinical response. Further clinical studies of WT1 vaccination in patients with malignant gliomas as well as other cancers are warranted. An enhancement of the efficacy of WT1 vaccination can be expected with a combined treatment using the WT1-specific helper peptide or anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Administration of WT1 vaccination along with other therapeutic modalities during initial treatment or in the case showing minimal residual disease may prolong the survival time of the cancer patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19618858

"""The cost-effectiveness of tumor-treating fields therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.""","""Background: There is strong concern about the costs associated with adding tumor-treating fields (TTF) therapy to standard first-line treatment for glioblastoma (GBM). Hence, we aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of TTF therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with GBM. Methods: We developed a 3-health-state Markov model. The perspective was that of the French Health Insurance, and the horizon was lifetime. We calculated the transition probabilities from the survival parameters reported in the EF-14 trial. The main outcome measure was incremental effectiveness expressed as life-years gained (LYG). Input costs were derived from the literature. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost/LYG. We used 1-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate the model uncertainty. Results: In the base-case analysis, adding TTF therapy to standard of care resulted in increases of life expectancy of 4.08 months (0.34 LYG) and €185 476 per patient. The ICER was €549 909/LYG. The discounted ICER was €596 411/LYG. Parameters with the most influence on ICER were the cost of TTF therapy, followed equally by overall survival and progression-free survival in both arms. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a 95% confidence interval of the ICER of €447 017/LYG to €745 805/LYG with 0% chance to be cost-effective at a threshold of €100 000/LYG. Conclusion: The ICER of TTF therapy at first-line treatment is far beyond conventional thresholds due to the prohibitive announced cost of the device.

Here, we examined this hypothesis using magnetic resonance (MR) images derived from 217 The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) glioblastoma subjects. Methods: Pre-operative MR images were segmented automatically into contrast enhancing (CE) tumor volumes using Iterative Probabilistic Voxel Labeling (IPVL). Distances were calculated from the centroid of CE tumor volumes to the SVZ and correlated with gene expression profiles of the corresponding glioblastomas. Correlative analyses were performed between SVZ distance, gene expression patterns, and clinical survival. Results: Glioblastoma located in proximity to the SVZ showed increased mRNA expression patterns associated with the cancer stem-cell state, including CD133 (P = 0.006). Consistent with the previous observations suggesting that glioblastoma stem cells exhibit increased DNA repair capacity, glioblastomas in proximity to the SVZ also showed increased expression of DNA repair genes, including MGMT (P = 0.018). Reflecting this enhanced DNA repair capacity, the genomes of glioblastomas in SVZ proximity harbored fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms relative to those located distant to the SVZ (P = 0.003). Concordant with the notion that glioblastoma stem cells are more aggressive and refractory to therapy, patients with glioblastoma in proximity to SVZ exhibited poorer progression free and overall survival (P < 0.01). Conclusion: An unbiased analysis of TCIA suggests that glioblastomas located in proximity to the SVZ exhibited mRNA expression profiles associated with stem cell properties, increased DNA repair capacity, and is associated with poor clinical survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32556864

"""Encapsulation of packaging cell line results in successful retroviral-mediated transfer of a suicide gene in vivo in an experimental model of glioblastoma.""","""Aims: Retroviral-mediated gene therapy has been proposed as a primary or adjuvant treatment for advanced cancer, because retroviruses selectively infect dividing cells. Efficacy of retroviral-mediated gene transfer, however, is limited in vivo. Although packaging cell lines can produce viral vectors continuously, such allo- or xenogeneic cells are normally rejected when used in vivo. Encapsulation using microporous membranes can protect the packaging cells from rejection. In this study, we used an encapsulated murine packaging cell line to test the effects of in situ delivery of a retrovirus bearing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene in a rat model of orthotopic glioblastoma. Materials and methods: To test gene transfer in vitro, encapsulated murine psi2-VIK packaging cells were co-cultured with baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and the percentage of transfected BHK cells was determined. For in vivo experiments, orthotopic C6 glioblastomas were established in Wistar rats. Capsules containing psi2-VIK cells were stereotaxically implanted into these tumours and the animals were treated with ganciclovir (GCV). Tumours were harvested 14 days after initiation of GCV therapy for morphometric analysis. Results: Encapsulation of psi2-VIK cells increased transfection rates of BHK target cells significantly in vitro compared to psi2-VIK conditioned medium (3 x 10(6) vs 2.3 x 10(4) cells; P<0.001). In vivo treatment with encapsulated packaging cells resulted in 3% to 5% of C6 tumour cells transduced and 45% of tumour volume replaced by necrosis after GCV (P<0.01 compared to controls).

"""Intraarterial drug delivery for glioblastoma mutiforme: Will the phoenix rise again?""","""Intraarterial (IA) drug delivery is a physiologically appealing strategy as drugs are widely distributed throughout the tumor capillary network and high regional tissue concentrations can be achieved with low total doses. IA treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been attempted since the 1950s but success has been elusive. Although IA treatments have been embraced for the treatment of retinoblastoma and advanced liver cancers, this has not been the case for GBM. The development of IA drug delivery for the treatment of brain cancer over the last several decades reveals a number of critical oversights. For example, very few studies took into consideration the underlying hydrodynamic factors. Therapeutic failures were often blamed on an inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier or on the streaming of drugs. Similarly, there were few methods to investigate the ultra-fast pharmacokinetics of IA drugs. Despite past failures, clinical interest in IA drugs for the treatment of GBM persists. The advent of modern imaging methods along with a better understanding of hydrodynamics factors, better appreciation of the complex morphology of GBM, improved drug selection and formulations, and development of methods to minimize treatment-related neurological injury, promise to considerably advance the application of IA drugs for GBM treatment.

Materials and methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry, we identified the oldest-old patients with glioblastomas between 2005 and 2016. Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression analysis, and competing risk model were used to assess the curative efficacy of the surgical treatments. Stratification and interaction analysis were performed to explore the potential interaction effects. The conditional survival rates were calculated to explore the longitudinal change in the survival probability over time. Results: This study enrolled 3309 patients with a median overall survival of 3 months. The overall survival differed significantly among the different surgical groups. Considering the gross total resection as reference, subtotal resection presented adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.197 (1.052-1.362; p < 0.001); biopsy/partial resection, 1.242 (1.083-1.424; p = 0.002); and no surgery, 1.309 (1.145-1.497; p < 0.006). Age ≥ 83 years, widowed/other status, tumor size 4-5 cm, and temporal tumors showed significant interaction effects. The adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of radical resection was 0.729 (0.645-0.825; p < 0.001). Based on disease-specific survival, the 1-year survival rate was 18% and 26% for the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 1-year conditional survival rates in the second year were 54% and 39% in the non-radical and radical surgery groups, respectively. The 3-year survival rates were 10% in both the groups. Conclusions: Radical surgery may have short-term benefits in the oldest-old patients with glioblastoma, with a significant increase in the 1-year survival rate. However, its contribution in the long-term outcome is limited due to decreased conditional survival rates from the second year after surgery.

However, when used in conjunction with a CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) antagonist, anti-PD-1 has shown efficacy in preclinical studies. In this paper, we aim to optimize treatment regimens for this combination immunotherapy using optimal control theory. We extend a treatment-free glioblastoma-immune dynamics ODE model to include interventions with anti-PD-1 and the CCR2 antagonist. An optimized regimen increases the survival of an average mouse from 32 days post-tumor implantation without treatment to 111 days with treatment. We scale this approach to a virtual murine cohort to evaluate mortality and quality of life concerns during treatment, and predict survival, tumor recurrence, or death after treatment. A parameter identifiability analysis identifies five parameters suitable for personalizing treatment within the virtual cohort. Sampling from these five practically identifiable parameters for the virtual murine cohort reveals that personalized, optimized regimens enhance survival: 84% of the virtual mice survive to day 100, compared to 60% survival in a previously studied experimental regimen. Subjects with high tumor growth rates and low T cell kill rates are identified as more likely to die during and after treatment due to their compromised immune systems and more aggressive tumors.

The rats were randomly divided into three groups: without light, with light split into 2 fractions and with light split into 5 fractions. Treatment effects were assessed using brain immunohistology. Results: Fractionated treatments induced intratumoral necrosis (P < 0.001) and peritumoral edema (P = 0.009) associated with a macrophagic infiltration (P = 0.006). The ratio of apoptotic cells was higher in the 5-fraction group than in either the sham (P = 0.024) or 2-fraction group (P = 0.01).

Glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 were divided into four groups and treated with control, LV‑STAT3 siRNA, AZD0530, and combined LV‑STAT3 siRNA with AZD0530, respectively. The proliferation and apoptotic capacity of glioblastoma cells was assessed by Cell Counting Kit‑8 and double staining flow cytometry assays, respectively. Additionally, the potential effect of LV‑STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 on glioblastoma was evaluated in vivo. Images were captured of the tumor formation in mice every week. Following three weeks of treatment, NMR scan and immunohistochemistry were performed. The treatment of combined LV‑STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 was more effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosisof glioblastoma cells in comparison with the treatment of either LV‑STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 alone. Although LV‑STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 treatment alone suppressed tumor growth in mice, the combined treatment had a more significant effect than the treatment of LV‑STAT3 siRNA or AZD0530 alone. According to the results of both in vitro and in vivo assays, a combined therapy of LV‑STAT3 siRNA with AZD0530 could enhance therapeutic effects on glioblastoma, supporting the idea that the combination of LV‑STAT3 siRNA and AZD0530 could serve as a novel and effective strategy to combat glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31485668
"""Combinatorial approaches to effective therapy in glioblastoma (GBM): Current status and what the future holds.""","""The aggressive and recurrent nature of glioblastoma is multifactorial and has been attributed to its biological heterogeneity, dysfunctional metabolic signaling pathways, rigid blood-brain barrier, inherent resistance to standard therapy due to the stemness property of the gliomas cells, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, hypoxia and neoangiogenesis which are very well orchestrated and create the tumor's own highly pro-tumorigenic milieu. Once the relay of events starts amongst these components, eventually it becomes difficult to control the cascade using only the balanced contemporary care of treatment consisting of maximal resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolamide. Over the past few decades, implementation of contemporary treatment modalities has shown benefit to some extent, but no significant overall survival benefit is achieved. Therefore, there is an unmet need for advanced multifaceted combinatorial strategies. Recent advances in molecular biology, development of innovative therapeutics and novel delivery platforms over the years has resulted in a paradigm shift in gliomas therapeutics. Decades of research has led to emergence of several treatment molecules, including immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade, oncolytic virotherapy, adoptive cell therapy, nanoparticles, CED and BNCT, each with the unique proficiency to overcome the mentioned challenges, present research. Recent years are seeing innovative combinatorial strategies to overcome the multifactorial resistance put forth by the GBM cell and its TME.

This is mainly because most patients suffer recurrence after treatment that currently consists in maximal resection followed by radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide. The recurrent tumor shows a more aggressive behavior due to a phenotypic shift toward the mesenchymal subtype. Proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) may represent for GBM the equivalent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated with other aggressive cancers. In this review we frame this process in the high degree of phenotypic inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of GBM, which exists in different subtypes, each one characterized by further phenotypic variability in its stem-cell compartment. Under the selective pressure of different treatment agents PMT is induced. The mechanisms involved, as well as the significance of such event in the acquisition of a multitherapy resistance phenotype, are taken in consideration for future perspectives in new anti-GBM therapeutic options.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167470

A mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG2A) (mAb 425) (EMD55900) (Merck KGaA, Bernstadt, Germany) directed against EGF-R was produced for therapeutic use. Eight patients with primary or recurrent, EGF-R-positive glioblastomas entered the study, which was designed to evaluate the clinical effect of the mAb. In order to achieve a high tumor cell saturation, the mAb was injected intratumorally twice weekly through an implantable catheter. The total administered dose varied between 4 mg and 120 mg. In 3 patients with solid tumors, a massive tumor necrosis was noted, with infiltration of macrophages, granulocytes and T cells. A further 3 patients developed clinical and radiological signs of an intense, local, inflammatory reaction. There may be a relation between the mAb dosage and the antitumor effect, insofar as higher doses seemed to cause a more pronounced, inflammatory reaction. Of the 8 patients, 6 developed human, anti-(mouse Ig) antibodies. This anti-EGF-R mAb may induce an intense, inflammatory reaction and a considerable necrosis in glioblastoma. However, the planned schedule could not be completed, even after the dose level was re-adjusted, owing to inflammatory reactions, which were severe without prior tumor debulking.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9191875
"""Potential therapeutic implications of cancer stem cells in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor. Despite recent therapeutic advances in other cancers, the treatment of glioblastomas remains ineffective and essentially palliative. The treatment failure is a result of a number of causes, but we and others have demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) display relative resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs also contribute to tumor growth through the stimulation of angiogenesis, which has been shown to be a useful therapeutic target in the treatment of recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas. Cancer stem cells also have been hypothesized as a contributor to systemic metastases. While glioblastomas rarely metastasize beyond the central nervous system, glioblastomas invade into brain structures to prevent surgical cure and GSCs have an extremely invasive phenotype. Collectively, these studies and others suggest that GSCs may be important therapeutic targets not only to achieve cure but even reduce tumor relapse and improve overall survival. Many recent studies suggest that GSCs share core regulatory pathways with normal embryonic and somatic stem cells, but display important distinctions that provide clues into useful treatment targets. The cancer stem cell hypothesis may also modify our approaches in tumor imaging and biomarker development, but clinical validation waits. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of GSC biology with a focus on potential anti-GSC therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20457135

While they were unable to statistically significantly demonstrate that bevacizumab in combination with other therapies increases the overall survival of GBM patients, there remains a question of potential benefits for subpopulations of patients. We use a mathematical model of GBM growth to investigate differential benefits of combining surgical resection, radiation and bevacizumab across observed tumour growth kinetics. The differential hypoxic burden after gross total resection (GTR) was assessed along with the change in radiation cell kill from bevacizumab-induced tissue re-normalization when starting therapy for tumours at different diagnostic sizes. Depending on the tumour size at the time of treatment, our model predicted that GTR would remove a variable portion of the hypoxic burden ranging from 11% to 99.99%. Further, our model predicted that the combination of bevacizumab with radiation resulted in an additional cell kill ranging from 2.6×10(7) to 1.1×10(10) cells.

"""Neural stem cells display extensive tropism for pathology in adult brain: evidence from intracranial gliomas.""","""One of the impediments to the treatment of brain tumors (e.g., gliomas) has been the degree to which they expand, infiltrate surrounding tissue, and migrate widely into normal brain, usually rendering them 'elusive' to effective resection, irradiation, chemotherapy, or gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs), when implanted into experimental intracranial gliomas in vivo in adult rodents, distribute themselves quickly and extensively throughout the tumor bed and migrate uniquely in juxtaposition to widely expanding and aggressively advancing tumor cells, while continuing to stably express a foreign gene. The NSCs 'surround' the invading tumor border while 'chasing down' infiltrating tumor cells. When implanted intracranially at distant sites from the tumor (e.g., into normal tissue, into the contralateral hemisphere, or into the cerebral ventricles), the donor cells migrate through normal tissue targeting the tumor cells (including human glioblastomas). When implanted outside the CNS intravascularly, NSCs will target an intracranial tumor. NSCs can deliver a therapeutically relevant molecule-cytosine deaminase-such that quantifiable reduction in tumor burden results. These data suggest the adjunctive use of inherently migratory NSCs as a delivery vehicle for targeting therapeutic genes and vectors to refractory, migratory, invasive brain tumors. More broadly, they suggest that NSC migration can be extensive, even in the adult brain and along nonstereotypical routes, if pathology (as modeled here by tumor) is present.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11070094
"""The oncolytic Newcastle disease virus as an effective immunotherapeutic strategy against glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults, with a dismal prognosis despite aggressive resection, chemotherapeutics, and radiotherapy. Although understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of glioblastoma has progressed in recent years, therapeutic options have failed to significantly change overall survival or progression-free survival.

The application of oncolytic virotherapy as a novel biological to target pathogenic signaling in glioblastoma has brought new hope to the field of neuro-oncology. This class of immunotherapeutics combines selective cancer cell lysis prompted by virus induction while promoting a strong inflammatory antitumor response, thereby acting as an effective in situ tumor vaccine.

We report here our experience using this treatment for recurrent glioblastomas. Materials and methods: Four patients, from 40 to 58 years old, were diagnosed with glioblastoma. After total resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, recurrence occurred. As each was ineligible for a second surgery, LITT was proposed as salvage therapy. Under stereotactic guidance, a fiberoptic applicator was inserted within the tumor LITT was performed under continuous MRTI. Real-time feedback control based on MRTI was employed to assess the quality of local tissue destruction and to prevent unwanted damage to nearby structures. Results: The procedure was well tolerated with no peroperative neurological deterioration. In the short-term follow-up, one transient supplementary motor area syndrome, one epileptic seizure, and one cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred. All were successfully managed. Post-procedure MRI showed no complication, satisfying treatment volume, and a decrease in size of the treated tumor. For all patients, recurrence was observed with a mean/median progression free survival of 37/30 days. Mean/median overall survival after LITT was 10.5/10 months. Conclusion: Focal tumor control was performed safely using minimally invasive LITT with real-time MRTI control. LITT could be considered as salvage therapy for high-grade recurrent gliomas if a 1-day treatment is considered useful for a few weeks gain in survival. Larger experience will be required to define indications for such infiltrative disease and accurately determine a potentially significant survival gain in good neurological condition associated with this 1-day procedure.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22488658

The values of the mean, minimum, and maximum ADC (ADC(mean), ADC(MIN), and ADC(MAX), respectively) of each tumor were preoperatively determined from several regions of interest defined in the tumors. After surgical intervention, all patients underwent irradiation and chemotherapy performed according to our hospital protocol.

Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the log-rank test, and multiple regression analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Likelihood ratio tests confirmed that ADC(MIN) was the strongest among the three prognostic factors. Total surgical removal was the most important predictive factor for overall survival (P<0.01). ADC(MIN) was also statistically correlated with overall survival (P<0.05) and could be used to classify patients into different prognostic groups.

In multivariate analyses, frontal location (p=0.032) and cumulative EQD2 ≥90 Gy (p=0.038) were significant; KPS 80-100% (p=0.110) and EQD2 ≥30 Gy (p=0.083) showed trends. Conclusion: Predictors of survival after re-irradiation for recurrent GBM were identified that can help when designing personalized treatments. Use of irradiation with EQD2 ≥30 Gy appeared superior to lower doses.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33288605
"""Personalized radiation therapy for glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor with an estimated 14,000 Americans diagnosed with this disease annually. This disease is treated with maximal surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was initially delivered to the whole brain and with no concurrent or adjuvant systemic therapy. Advances in imaging and treatment delivery have allowed for partial brain irradiation to minimize radiation dose to normal structures, as well as sparing structures important for memory such as the hippocampus, decreasing morbidity and toxicity. While there is no consensus on the optimal radiation volume needed to successfully treat glioblastoma, there is consensus that the tumor bed with margin is preferable to treatment of the whole brain. Additionally, advances in knowledge regarding tumor biology have demonstrated the benefit of concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as demonstrated that methylation of genes in the tumor can predispose greater responsiveness to chemotherapy. The following review describes the advancements in specific radiation techniques that have been used to improve the therapeutic ratio for management of glioblastoma and methods used to personalize radiation treatment for patients based on genomic markers as well as clinical factors. The review also describes future investigations that are currently taking place in order to enable a further improvement of clinical outcomes for patients with glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38453659

"""Insurance correlates with improved access to care and outcome among glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: The current standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) constitutes maximal safe surgical resection, followed by fractionated radiation and temozolomide. This treatment regimen is logistically burdensome, and in a health care system in which access to care is variable, there may be patients with worsened outcomes due to inadequate access to optimal treatment. Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with diagnoses of GBM in 2006-2014. Patients were grouped according to insurance status: private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or uninsured. Treatments provided (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) were compared between groups in univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 61614 patients were analyzed. Compared with private insurance, the odds of surgery for Medicaid and uninsured patients were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66-0.79) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87), respectively (P < 0.001). The multivariable odds of receiving radiotherapy were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.68), and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.43-0.52) for Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured patients, respectively (all P < 0.001). In addition, the odds of receiving chemotherapy were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99), 0.53 (95% CI: 0.49-0.57), and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.38-0.46) for Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured patients, respectively (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: Insurance status and type of insurance coverage appear to impact treatments rendered for GBM, independently of other variables. Furthermore, we find that such differential access to care significantly impacts survival. Ensuring adequate access to care for all patients with diagnoses of glioblastoma is critical to optimize survival, especially as therapies continue to advance.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893906
"""Rational design of ROS-responsive nanocarriers for targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy and cascaded chemotherapy of intracranial glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary intracranial tumor because of its high invasiveness and recurrence. Therefore, nanocarriers with blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and transcranial-controlled drug release and activation are rather attractive options for glioblastoma treatment. Herein, we designed a multifunctional nanocarrier (T-TKNPVP) that combined targeted X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) and cascaded reactive oxygen species (ROS)-boosted chemotherapy. The T-TKNPVP loaded with verteporfin (VP) and paclitaxel (PTX) was self-assembled from an angiopep-2 (Ang) peptide, functionalized Ang-PEG-DSPE and ROS-sensitive PEG-TK-PTX conjugate. After systemic injection, the T-TKNPVP efficiently crossed the BBB and targeted the GBM cells via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Upon X-ray irradiation, they can generate a certain amount of ROS, which not only induces X-PDT but also locoregionally activates PTX release and action by cleaving the TK bridged bonds. As evidenced by 9.4 T MRI and other experiments, such nanocarriers offer significant growth inhibition of GBM in situ and prolong the survival times of U87-MG tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, the designed T-TKNPVP provided an alternative avenue for realizing transcranial X-PDT and X-ray-activated chemotherapy for targeted and locoregional GBM treatment in vivo.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35293920

Even with aggressive surgical resections using state-of-the-art preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, along with recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains dismal: median survival after diagnosis is about 14 months. Established good prognostic factors are limited, but include young age, high Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), high mini-mental status examination score, O6-methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation, and resection of > 98% of the tumor. Standard treatment includes resection, followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. GBM research is being conducted worldwide at a remarkable pace, with some of the more recent promising studies focused on identification of aberrant genetic events and signaling pathways, tumor stem cell identification and characterization, modulation of tumor immunological responses, combination therapies, and understanding of the rare long-term survivors. Past treatment strategies have failed for various reasons; however, newer strategies in trials today and on the horizon encourage optimism.

The tumour originates from astrocytes and therefore comes under the glioma known as astrocytoma. These tumours exhibit miscellaneous properties and contain cancer stem cells (CSCs). The stem cells exhibit diverse mechanisms through which these cells indulge in the proliferation and renewal of their systems. CSCs pose a significant obstacle as far as a cancer therapy is concerned, which incorporates blocking important signalling pathways involved in CSCs' self-renewal and survival which may also include inhibition of the ATP-binding cassette transporters. Nanomedicine, biomarkers and drug delivery technologybased approaches using nanoparticles have tremendous ability to tackle the restrictions impending clinical applications, such as diagnosis and targeting of CSC-specific agents. Nanocarrier-based therapeutic agents have shown the potential of penetrating CSCs and increasing drug accumulation in CSCs. Nanomedicine can overcome ATP-driven pumpmediated multidrug resistance while also reducing the harmful effects on non-cancerous cells.

"""Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Mediated Dual-Gene Therapy for Glioblastoma.""","""Bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used for systemic delivery of therapeutic genes to solid tumors. However, the optimal treatment time post-BMSC implantation and the assessment of the long-term fate of therapeutic BMSCs post-tumor treatment are critical if such promising therapies are to be translated into clinical practice. An efficient BMSC-based therapeutic strategy has been developed that simultaneously allows killing of tumor cells, inhibiting of tumor angiogenesis, and assessment and eradication of implanted BMSCs after treatment of glioblastoma. BMSCs were engineered to co-express the angiogenesis inhibitor kringle 5 (K5) of human plasminogen, under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) and the human sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), involved in uptake of radioisotopes, under the control of early growth response factor 1 (Egr1), a radiation-activated promoter. A significant decrease in tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis and a subsequent increase in survival were observed when mice bearing glioblastoma were treated with 188Re post-therapeutic intravenous BMSC implantation. Furthermore, the systemic administration of 188Re post-tumor treatment selectively eliminated therapeutic BMSCs expressing NIS, which was monitored in real time by 125I micro single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging. Meanwhile, the Egr1 promoter induced a 188Re radiation positive feedback effect absorbed by NIS. After intravenous BMSC implantation, BMSCs levels in the tumor and lung both peaked on day 10 and decreased to the lowest levels on days 24 and 17, respectively. These findings suggest that day 17 post-BMSC implantation could be an optimal time for 188Re treatment.

"""Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) modeling of diffusion MRI during chemoradiation predicts therapeutic response in IDH wildtype glioblastoma.""","""Background: Prediction of early progression in glioblastoma may provide an opportunity to personalize treatment. Simplified intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI offers quantitative estimates of diffusion and perfusion metrics. We investigated whether these metrics, during chemoradiation, could predict treatment outcome. Methods: 38 patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastoma undergoing 6-week/30-fraction chemoradiation had standardized post-operative MRIs at baseline (radiation planning), and at the 10th and 20th fractions. Non-overlapping T1-enhancing (T1C) and non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintense regions were independently segmented. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCT1C, ADCT2-FLAIR) and perfusion fraction (fT1C, fT2-FLAIR) maps were generated with simplified IVIM modelling. Parameters associated with progression before or after 6.9 months (early vs late progression, respectively), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were investigated. Results: Higher ADCT2-FLAIR at baseline [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, p = 0.025], lower fT2-FLAIR at fraction 10 (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.04-4.27, p = 0.018), and lack of increase in ADCT2-FLAIR at fraction 20 compared to baseline (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p = 0.02) were associated with early progression. Combining ADCT2-FLAIR at baseline, fT2-FLAIR at fraction 10, ECOG and MGMT promoter methylation status significantly improved AUC to 90.3% compared to a model with only ECOG and MGMT promoter methylation status (p = 0.001).

"""EnLIGHTenment of tumor vessel normalization and immunotherapy in glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly vascularized and aggressive brain tumor. Despite aggressive standard care, GBM remains predominantly fatal; hence, new innovative therapies are required. Recent research published in the Journal of Pathology has identified the CGKRK peptide as a promising tool with which to specifically target the tumor vasculature from high-grade glioma. This tumor vessel-homing peptide was fused to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member LIGHT/TNFSF14, and injected intravenously into murine orthotopic GBM models. After treatment, the tumor vasculature appeared to be less abnormal, with normalized features such as increased endothelial barrier integrity, pericyte contractility, and tumor perfusion. Moreover, CGKRK-LIGHT induced the appearance of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which are specialized structures that play a role in lymphocyte trafficking and have been shown to increase T-cell infiltration in solid tumors. Combining CGKRK-LIGHT with anti-angiogenic and immune checkpoint blockade treatments boosted HEV induction and cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, leading to a reduction in tumor burden.

"""Molecularly targeted therapies for recurrent glioblastoma: current and future targets.""","""Object: Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and diffusely infiltrative primary brain tumor. Recurrence is expected and is extremely difficult to treat. Over the past decade, the accumulation of knowledge regarding the molecular and genetic profile of glioblastoma has led to numerous molecularly targeted therapies. This article aims to review the literature and highlight the mechanisms and efficacies of molecularly targeted therapies for recurrent glioblastoma. Methods: A systematic search was performed with the phrase '(name of particular agent) and glioblastoma' as a search term in PubMed to identify all articles published up until 2014 that included this phrase in the title and/or abstract. The references of systematic reviews were also reviewed for additional sources. The review included clinical studies that comprised at least 20 patients and reported results for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma with molecular targeted therapies. Results: A total of 42 articles were included in this review. In the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, various targeted therapies have been tested over the past 10-15 years. The targets of interest include epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Ras pathway, protein kinase C, mammalian target of rapamycin, histone acetylation, and integrins. Unfortunately, the clinical responses to most available targeted therapies are modest at best. Radiographic responses generally range in the realm of 5%-20%. Progression-free survival at 6 months and overall survival were also modest with the majority of studies reporting a 10%-20% 6-month progression-free survival and 5- to 8-month overall survival. There have been several clinical trials evaluating the use of combination therapy for molecularly targeted treatments. In general, the outcomes for combination therapy tend to be superior to single-agent therapy, regardless of the specific agent studied. Conclusions: Recurrent glioblastoma remains very difficult to treat, even with molecular targeted therapies and anticancer agents. The currently available targeted therapy regimens have poor to modest activity against recurrent glioblastoma. As newer agents are actively being developed, combination regimens have provided the most promising results for improving outcomes. Targeted therapies matched to molecular profiles of individual tumors are predicted to be a critical component necessary for improving efficacy in future trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434384

Using published facts on primary glioblastomas, with special reference to cancer stem cells and their recently described heterogeneity, a hypothesis is being proposed that speculates the possible role of therapy mediated neoplastic cell loss in promoting the process of relapse in these tumors. The mechanisms by which such a phenomenon could be functional has been integrated into a double version theoretical model, which envisages glioblastomas as neoplasms comprising of multiple, differentially regulated and dynamically distinct neoplastic compartments (named as active and back-up compartments in this article) supported by their own complement of cancer stem cells, wherein therapy mediated cell loss, which mainly affects the size of the active compartment, results in abrogating the inhibitory effect of the active compartment on the back-up compartment, thereby leading to the activation of the back-up compartment. This activation contributes towards tumor recurrence. The possibility of the existence of such a phenomenon could have strong implications on management and prognosis of these tumors.

"""Near Infrared Fluorescent Nanoplatform for Targeted Intraoperative Resection and Chemotherapeutic Treatment of Glioblastoma.""","""Despite significant efforts to improve glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment, GBM remains one of the most lethal cancers. Effective GBM treatments require sensitive intraoperative tumor visualization and effective postoperative chemotherapeutic delivery. Unfortunately, the diffusive and infiltrating nature of GBM limits the detection of GBM tumors, and current intraoperative visualization methods limit complete tumor resection. In addition, although chemotherapy is often used to eliminate any cancerous tissue remaining after surgery, most chemotherapeutic drugs do not effectively cross the brain-blood barrier (BBB) or enter GBM tumors. As a result, GBM has limited treatment options with high recurrence rates, and methods that improve its complete visualization during surgery and treatment are needed. Herein, we report a fluorescent nanoparticle platform for the near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-based tumor boundary visualization and image-guided drug delivery into GBM tumors. Our nanoplatform is based on ferumoxytol (FMX), an FDA-approved magnetic resonance imaging-sensitive superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle, which is conjugated with hepthamethine cyanine (HMC), a NIRF ligand that specifically targets the organic anion transporter polypeptides that are overexpressed in GBM. We have shown that HMC-FMX nanoparticles cross the BBB and selectively accumulate in the tumor using orthotopic GBM mouse models, enabling NIRF-based visualization of infiltrating tumor tissue. In addition, HMC-FMX can encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel or cisplatin, and deliver these agents into GBM tumors, reducing tumor size and increasing survival. Taken together, these observations indicate that HMC-FMX is a promising nanoprobe for GBM surgical visualization and drug delivery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32551496

"""Localized RNAi therapeutics of chemoresistant grade IV glioma using hyaluronan-grafted lipid-based nanoparticles.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most infiltrating, aggressive, and poorly treated brain tumors. Progress in genomics and proteomics has paved the way for identifying potential therapeutic targets for treating GBM, yet the vast majority of these leading drug candidates for the treatment of GBM are ineffective, mainly due to restricted passages across the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticles have been emerged as a promising platform to treat different types of tumors due to their ability to transport drugs to target sites while minimizing adverse effects. Herein, we devised a localized strategy to deliver RNA interference (RNAi) directly to the GBM site using hyaluronan (HA)-grafted lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs). These LNPs having an ionized lipid were previously shown to be highly effective in delivering small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into various cell types. LNP's surface was functionalized with hyaluronan (HA), a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan that specifically binds the CD44 receptor expressed on GBM cells. We found that HA-LNPs can successfully bind to GBM cell lines and primary neurosphers of GBM patients. HA-LNPs loaded with Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNAs (siPLK1) dramatically reduced the expression of PLK1 mRNA and cumulated in cell death even under shear flow that simulate the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid compared with control groups. Next, a human GBM U87MG orthotopic xenograft model was established by intracranial injection of U87MG cells into nude mice. Convection of Cy3-siRNA entrapped in HA-LNPs was performed, and specific Cy3 uptake was observed in U87MG cells. Moreover, convection of siPLK1 entrapped in HA-LNPs reduced mRNA levels by more than 80% and significantly prolonged survival of treated mice in the orthotopic model. Taken together, our results suggest that RNAi therapeutics could effectively be delivered in a localized manner with HA-coated LNPs and ultimately may become a therapeutic modality for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25558928

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with C11 methionine (MET) (MET-PET) for detecting changes that occur after chemoradiation therapy and the value of molecular biomarkers for predicting the magnitude of metabolic response. Methods and materials: Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma undergoing standard chemoradiation treatment were enrolled in this prospective imaging study, with MET-PET scan performed within 3 days after surgical resection and again at 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Near contemporaneous contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 2 weeks of each MET-PET scan. MET-PET imaging was analyzed for maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUVmean, and SUVvolume on a multimodality workstation. Results: A total of 18 patients underwent baseline postoperative MET-PET imaging, 14 of whom underwent postchemoradiation MET-PET imaging. Among those who showed residual MET-avid disease on immediate postoperative MET-PET scans and underwent postchemoradiation MET-PET imaging (n = 10), mean ΔSUVmax was -40% (range -100% to 0%), mean ΔSUVmean was -35% (range -100% to 0%), and mean ΔSUV volume was -64% (range -100% to 0%). The Δtumor/brain reference was -40% (range -100% to 0%) using SUVmax and -35% (range -100% to 0%) using SUVmean. In contrast, none of the T2-weighted images on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed a >25% reduction in abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal on visual assessment. ΔSUVmax, ΔSUVmean, and ΔSUVvolume correlated with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status (P = .01), but not with epidermal growth factor receptor or c-MET amplification status. All patients were IDH-1 wildtype. Conclusions: MET-PET scanning shows a significant decrease in metabolic signal at 1 month after chemoradiation compared with the immediate postoperative period, even when T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changed little. MGMT promoter methylation status further predicts differential metabolic responses. MET-PET may be a useful tool for delineation of radiation targets and assessment of response.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29913253
"""Inhibition of telomerase increases the susceptibility of human malignant glioblastoma cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.""","""Malignant glioblastomas grow very rapidly and are generally resistant to either DNA-damaging drugs or gamma-irradiation. If tumor cells could be made more susceptible to cell death with treatments, this would clearly represent a significant improvement in the success of treatment. Recently, telomerase has become a focus of interest among oncologists as a target for treating cancer cells. Telomerase elongates telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGGG)n and is important in protecting and replicating DNA. The vast majority of tumor cells, indeed, express telomerase activity whereas normal somatic cells, except for a few cells, do not. Since telomerase is essential for protecting DNA, we may be able to make tumors more sensitive to treatments with DNA-damaging drugs by inhibiting telomerase activity. In this study, we used cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin)-sensitive U87-MG cells and cisplatin-resistant U251-MG of human malignant glioblastoma cell lines. U87-MG cells did not express telomerase activity, whereas telomerase was highly detected in U251-MG cells. Interestingly, inhibition of telomerase with an antisense telomerase expression vector not only decreased telomerase activity but also increased susceptibility to cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in U251-MG cells. These findings suggest that treatment with antisense telomerase may represent a new chemosensitisation for tumors resistant to anticancer drugs.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619833

This is the first report of a pilot study of the use of Fluosol and HBO with radiation in humans. Twenty patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme were treated in a phase I trial of radiation with Fluosol and HBO at three atmospheres. Total Fluosol dose was escalated from 42 ml/kg in six courses to 80 ml/kg in four courses. Patients were irradiated in an HBO chamber with 600 cGy weekly fractions following Fluosol administration. Sixteen patients completed treatment; no interruption was necessitated by treatment toxicity. The addition of Fluosol/HBO did not increase the incidence of HBO related toxicities. No significant chronic toxicities were seen. This pilot study demonstrates that Fluosol and HBO can safely be used as an adjunct to radiation in the treatment of human tumors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1327243
"""Comparison of outcomes between overlapping structure-based and non-overlapping structure-based optimization for simultaneous integrated boost IMRT for malignant gliomas.""","""Background: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can deliver different doses to two target volumes with high conformity. The purpose of the present study was to compare outcomes provided by two different optimization methods, overlapping structure-based and non-overlapping structure-based methods, for simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-IMRT for malignant gliomas. Methods: Treatment plans for three glioblastomas and one anaplastic astrocytoma were analyzed in the present study. The planning protocol was to deliver 70 Gy/28 fractions (fr) to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 56 Gy/28 fr to the surrounding edema. Two different optimization methods were tested for optimizing dose distribution to the GTVand the surrounding edema. One method was the 'including method', an overlapping structure-based (GTV and the clinical target volume [CTV]) optimization method. The other method was the 'annulus method', a non-overlapping structure-based (GTV and the subtracted volume) optimization method. Dosimetric indexes derived from dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were used for the analysis. Results: There was no significant difference between the two methods in the mean doses of the target volumes and the doses delivered to the 5% or 95% target volumes (D05 or D95). The mean dose to the brain by the including method was significantly higher than that delivered by the annulus method (P = 0.0001). The D05 of the brain showed no significant difference between the two methods. Conclusion: The two optimization methods provided comparable dose distributions within the target volumes and normal brain.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15616880
"""Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Glioma: Systematic Review.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Treatment is largely palliative, with current strategies unable to prevent inevitable tumor recurrence. Implantable micro-electromechanical systems are becoming more feasible for the management of several human diseases. These systems may have a role in detecting tumor recurrence and delivering localized therapies. One potential therapeutic tool is ultraviolet (UV) light. This systematic review assesses the effects of UV light on glioma cells. A total of 47 publications are included. The large majority were in vitro experiments conducted on human glioblastoma cell lines in monolayer. In these cells, UV light was shown to induce apoptosis and the expression of genes or activation of proteins that modulate cell death, repair, and proliferation. The nature and magnitude of cellular response varied by UV wavelength, dose, cell line, and time after irradiation. UVC (wavelength 100-280 nm) was most effective at inducing apoptosis, and this effect was dose dependent. The included studies had varied methodologies, complicating reconciliation of results. Further work will be required to determine the best regime of UV irradiation for therapeutic use. J. Cell.

"""Current status of gene therapy for brain tumors.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary brain tumor in adults, with current treatments having limited impact on disease progression. Therefore the development of alternative treatment options is greatly needed. Gene therapy is a treatment strategy that relies on the delivery of genetic material, usually transgenes or viruses, into cells for therapeutic purposes, and has been applied to GBM with increasing promise. We have included selectively replication-competent oncolytic viruses within this strategy, although the virus acts directly as a complex biologic anti-tumor agent rather than as a classic gene delivery vehicle. GBM is a good candidate for gene therapy because tumors remain locally within the brain and only rarely metastasize to other tissues; the majority of cells in the brain are post-mitotic, which allows for specific targeting of dividing tumor cells; and tumors can often be accessed neurosurgically for administration of therapy. Delivery vehicles used for brain tumors include nonreplicating viral vectors, normal adult stem/progenitor cells, and oncolytic viruses. The therapeutic transgenes or viruses are typically cytotoxic or express prodrug activating suicide genes to kill glioma cells, immunostimulatory to induce or amplify anti-tumor immune responses, and/or modify the tumor microenvironment such as blocking angiogenesis. This review describes current preclinical and clinical gene therapy strategies for the treatment of glioma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23246627
"""Adjuvant intraarterial chemotherapy with nimustine in the management of World Health Organization Grade IV gliomas of the brain. Experience at the Department of Neurosurgery of Düsseldorf University.""","""A protocol with postoperative adjuvant intraarterial (ia) chemotherapy using nimustine (ACNU) was followed at the University of Düsseldorf (Federal Republic of Germany) after histologic confirmation of malignant glioma of the brain. The first iaACNU procedure was performed within 10 days of surgery, and immediately before postoperative irradiation. After radiotherapy further iaACNU courses were given. The study population consisted of 35 primarily treated malignant gliomas World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV, i.e., glioblastomas (NIV). Of these tumors 11 showed early progressive disease (PD) (NIV primPD), whereas 24 had stable or responsive disease (NIV SD&RD). Seven patients with recurrent malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV (NIV recurrent) were also treated plus six patients with malignant gliomas WHO Grade III (NIII). Experience with 50 treated patients resulted from this study. The median survival time (MST) for the group NIV was 14.2 months; 41.0% of patients were long-term survivors. The MST for the group NIV primPD was 7.8 months; 9.1% of patients were long-term survivors. For the group NIV SD&RD a MST of 18.3 months and 66.7% of long-term survivors were determined. Patients with recurrent tumors on this treatment protocol had an additional MST of 6.1 months. The total MST after first surgery was 16.2 months. The incidence of complications was low. Systemic complications were infrequent or rare. Retinal disturbances were seen in two patients; leukoencephalopathy was not seen in our patients. In 10% of patients cerebral complications were found, which were irreversible in 2% of patients. Complications could not be assigned unequivocally to the nitrosourea. These results compare favorably with what is reported in the literature, demonstrate the potential value of iaACNU in the treatment of malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV, and should encourage the initiation of a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant iaACNU in the therapy of these tumors. The authors propose iaACNU as a valuable approach in the management of primarily diagnosed malignant gliomas WHO Grade IV, but cannot recommend the delay of iaACNU until the recurrence of a brain tumor.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2553234
"""Comprehensive Analysis of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Landscape in Glioblastoma Reveals Tumor Heterogeneity and Implications for Prognosis and Immunotherapy.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal brain tumor with no effective treatment. The specific GBM tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) may contribute to resistance to immunotherapy, a tumor therapy with great potential. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating immune cells is essential for exploring biomarkers in GBM pathogenesis and immunotherapy. Methods: We estimated the relative abundances of 25 immune cell types in 796 GBM samples using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Unsupervised clustering was used to identify different GBM-associated TIME immune cell infiltration (GTMEI) patterns. The GTMEIscore system was constructed with principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the immune infiltration pattern of individual tumors. Results: We revealed three distinct GTMEI patterns with different clinical outcomes and modulated biological pathways. We developed a scoring system (GTMEIscore) to determine the immune infiltration pattern of individual tumors. We comprehensively analyzed the genomic characteristics, molecular subtypes and clinicopathological features as well as proteomic, phosphoproteomic, acetylomic, lipidomic and metabolomic properties associated with the GTMEIscore and revealed many novel dysregulated pathways and precise targets in GBM. Moreover, the GTMEIscore accurately quantified the immune status of many other cancer types. Clinically, the GTMEIscore was found to have significant potential therapeutic value for chemotherapy/radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and targeted therapy. Conclusions: For the first time, we employed a multilevel and multiplatform strategy to construct a multidimensional molecular map of tumors with different immune infiltration patterns. These results may provide theoretical basises for identifying more effective predictive biomarkers and developing more effective drug combination strategies or novel immunotherapeutic agents for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35309323
"""Glioblastoma blood flow measured with stable xenon CT indicates tumor necrosis, vascularity, and brain invasion.""","""Tumor vasculature is a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma. Imaging tumor blood flow may help assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments. We determined the clinical usefulness of stable xenon CT performed preoperatively in patients with glioblastoma. This is a prospective cohort study. We determined absolute tumor blood flow before surgery in 38 patients with glioblastoma using stable xenon CT. We also histologically examined tumor specimens obtained from surgery and quantified their vascularity (by CD31 and CD105 immunostain), necrosis (by hematoxylin and eosin stain), and the presence of neuronal processes (by neurofilament immunostain). According to the xenon CT blood flow map, there are 3 types of glioblastoma. Type I glioblastomas have unimodal high blood flow histograms; histologically there is little necrosis and vascular proliferation. Type II glioblastomas have unimodal low blood flow histograms; histologically there is prominent necrosis and vascular proliferation. We propose that in type II glioblastoma, the abnormal vessels induced by hypoxia are inefficient at promoting blood flow. Type III glioblastomas have multimodal blood flow histograms. Histologically there is significant neuronal tissue within the tumor. Patients with type III glioblastomas were more likely to develop a post-surgical deficit, consistent with the inclusion of normal tissue within the tumor. Preoperative measurement of absolute blood flow with stable xenon CT in patients with glioblastoma predicts key biological features of the tumor and may aid surgical planning.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22492958

Functional analyses and immune-related analyses results exhibited that M2-like pro-tumoral macrophages and neutrophils were enriched in cluster 2, while Natural killer cells' infiltration was decreased. The increased M2-like pro-tumoral macrophages in cluster 2 was confirmed by immunofluorescence. An integrated single-cell analysis validated the malignant features of cluster 2 neoplastic cells and discovered their crosstalk with M2-like pro-tumoral macrophages. Moreover, we observed that SOD3 knockdown might decrease the M2-like pro-tumoral transformation of macrophage in vitro and in vivo. Comprehensively, we revealed oxidative stress' prognostic and immunosuppressive potential in glioblastoma and discovered SOD3's potential role in regulating macrophage M2-like pro-tumoral transformation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37866784
"""Impact of Peritumoral Edema During Tumor Treatment Field Therapy: A Computational Modelling Study.""","""Background: Tumor treatment fields (TTFie-lds) are an approved adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma (GBM). The magnitude of applied electrical field has been shown to be related to the anti-tumoral response. However, peritumoral edema may result in shunting of electrical current around the tumor, thereby reducing the intra-tumoral electric field. In this study, we systematically address this issue with computational simulations. Methods: Finite element models are created of a human head with varying amounts of peritumoral edema surrounding a virtual tumor. The electric field distribution was simulated using the standard TTFields electrode montage. Electric field magnitude was extracted from the tumor and related to edema thickness. Two patient specific models were created to confirm these results. Results: The inclusion of peritumoral edema decreased the average magnitude of the electric field within the tumor. In the model considering a frontal tumor and an anterior-posterior electrode configuration, ≥6 mm of peritumoral edema decreased the electric field by 52%. In the patient specific models, peritumoral edema decreased the electric field magnitude within the tumor by an average of 26%. The effect of peritumoral edema on the electric field distribution was spatially heterogenous, being most significant at the tissue interface between edema and tumor. Conclusions: The inclusion of peritumoral edema during TTFields modelling may have a dramatic effect on the predicted electric field magnitude within the tumor. Given the importance of electric field magnitude for the anti-tumoral effects of TTFields, the presence of edema should be considered both in future modelling studies and when planning TTField therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286953
"""Challenges in the diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of glioblastoma in a patient with fever and xanthochromic CSF: a case report.""","""Background: Leptomeningeal spread with carcinomatous meningitis is a severe complication of glioblastoma, with a poor prognosis. Diagnosis is challenging, as the sensitivity of classic diagnostic investigations remains low for detecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor spread and exclusion of infectious causes is mandatory, especially if unusual clinical findings are present. Case presentation: A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for recurrent episodes of high fever and xanthochromic meningitis, with subacute onset. Her past medical history was significant for a left temporal glioblastoma, treated with surgical resection and adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy, with associated systemic immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy. An extensive workup especially with molecular microbiology testing for exclusion of infectious causes was performed. CSF was analyzed for typical bacterial and viral causes, but also pathogens associated with immunosuppression, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptococcus neoformans. A therapeutic trial of standard antituberculous drugs with repeated lumbar punctures were needed in order to exclude Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to confirm the diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis by cytopathological examination of the CSF. Conclusions: The case describes an unusual clinical presentation of a patient with glioblastoma associated leptomeningeal dissemination, as high fever and xanthochromic CSF could raise important diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the clinical practice. The diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis requires an extensive workup for exclusion of infectious causes which is important for urgent oncologic treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37148304

Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain-targeted near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb) aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation-mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550 nm and non-radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR-PTT). The brain-targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE-Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550 nm band-pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE-Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5 W cm-2 ).

"""Dosimetric impact of tumor treating field (TTField) transducer arrays onto treatment plans for glioblastomas - a planning study.""","""Background: Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) are a novel treatment strategy for glioblastoma (GBM) that is approved for the use concomitantly to adjuvant chemotherapy. Preclinical data suggest a synergistic interaction of TTFields and radiotherapy (RT). However, the dosimetric uncertainties caused by the highly dense arrays have led to caution of applying the TTF setup during RT. Methods: In a RW3 slab phantom we compared the MV- and kV-CT based planned dose with the measured dose. VMAT-plans were optimized on MV-CTs of an Alderson head phantom without TTF arrays and then re-calculated on the same phantom equipped with TTF arrays. Dose at organs at risk (OAR) and target volumes (PTVs) were compared. Results: Measurements at a depth of 2, 3 and 4 cm of a RW 3 slab phantom show an attenuation due to TTField arrays of 3.4, 3.7 and 2.7% respectively. This was in-line with calculated attenuations based on MV-CT (1.2, 2.5 and 2.5%) but not with the attenuation expected from kV-CT based calculations (7.1, 8.2 and 8.6%). Consecutive MV-CT based VMAT planning and re-calculation reveals, that the conformity and homogeneity are not affected by the presence of TTField arrays. The dose at organs at risk (OAR) can show increases or decreases by < 0.5 Gy, which should be considered especially in cases next to the scull base. Conclusion: MV-CT based dose calculation results in reliable dose distributions also in the presence of TTField arrays. There is a small but clinically not relevant interaction between the TTField arrays and VMAT dose application. Thus, daily replacement of TTField arrays is not necessary in regard to deeply located OARs. RT is feasible, when a VMAT treatment plan is optimized to an array free planning CT. As the biologic effect of a concomitant treatment especially on OARs is currently unknown, a concomitant treatment should be performed only within clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29471879

Therapy resistance of glioblastomas has been attributed to the presence of tumor initiating stem-like cells (TSCs). TSC-related markers have therefore been suggested to have promising potentials as prognostic markers in gliomas. Methodology/principal findings: The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and prognostic impact of the TSC-related marker Oct-4 in astrocytic brain tumors of increasing grade. In total 114 grade II, III and IV astrocytic brain tumors were immunohistochemically stained for Oct-4, and the fraction and intensity of Oct-4 positive cells were determined by morphometric analysis of full tumor sections. Oct-4 was expressed in all tumors, and the Oct-4 positive cell fraction increased with tumor grade (p = 0.045). There was no association between survival and Oct-4 positive cell fraction, neither when combining all tumor grades nor in analysis of individual grades. Oct-4 intensity was not associated with grade, but taking IDH1 status into account we found a tendency for high Oct-4 intensity to be associated with poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytomas. Double immunofluorescence stainings showed co-localization in the perivascular niches of Oct-4 and two other TSC markers CD133 and nestin in glioblastomas. In some areas Oct-4 was expressed independently of CD133 and nestin. Conclusions: In conclusion, high Oct-4 fraction was associated with tumor malignancy, but seemed to be without independent prognostic influence in glioblastomas.

Methods: Patients in two uniform groups (Groups A and B, each of which had 10 patients with histologically confirmed glioblastomas) received BSH at a dose used in earlier therapeutic trials (75 mg/kg of body weight, administered intravenously) 24 hours before surgical debulkment. Patients from Group B received additional hyaluronidase (200,000 IU, administered intravenously) immediately before BSH infusion. Boron concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Results: The application of hyaluronidase was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the tumor (maximum)-to-blood concentration ratio of 1.83 (range, 0.68-3.67) compared with 1.31 (range, 0.8-1.78) with BSH alone. Moreover, with the use of hyaluronidase, there was a tendency for a higher maximal concentration in tumor (not statistically significant). Boron accumulation in glioblastoma tissue was highly selective in both groups, with tumor-to-healthy brain concentration ratios ranging from 6:1 to 20:1.

"""Modular network mechanism of CCN1-associated resistance to HSV-1-derived oncolytic immunovirotherapies for glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and lethal primary brain malignancy in adults. Oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapies selectively kill GBM cells in a manner that elicits antitumor immunity. Cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1), a protein found in most GBM microenvironments, expression predicts resistance to OVs, particularly herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This study aims to understand how extracellular CCN1 alters the GBM intracellular state to confer OV resistance. Protein-protein interaction network information flow analyses of LN229 human GBM transcriptomes identified 39 novel nodes and 12 binary edges dominating flow in CCN1high cells versus controls. Virus response programs, notably against HSV-1, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways are highly enriched. Our results suggest that CCN1high states exploit IDH1 and TP53, and increase dependency on RPL6, HUWE1, and COPS5. To validate, we reproduce our findings in 65 other GBM cell line (CCLE) and 174 clinical GBM patient sample (TCGA) datasets.

"""Effect of adding temozolomide to radiation therapy on the incidence of pseudo-progression.""","""Recently, there has been greater awareness that combination radiation and temozolomide used to treat glioblastomas may cause increased contrast enhancement on the first post radiation MRI scan. However, this increased enhancement may stabilize or decrease over time and represent pseudo-progression (psPD) rather than true progressive disease. It has never been shown that this phenomenon is greater with combination therapy than radiation alone. To address this question, we reviewed MRI scans in glioblastoma patients treated with radiation alone versus patients treated with radiation and concomitant temozolomide and compared the frequency of psPD in the two groups. Eighteen of 47 patients (38%) treated with radiation alone demonstrated enlargement on their first post-radiation MRI scan and 11 of these 18 (61%) proved to have psPD as defined by no further enlargement on stable therapy for 3 months following radiation. Twenty-four of 45 patients (53%) treated with radiation and temozolomide had enlargement on their first post-radiation MRI scan and 13 of these 24 (54%) had psPD. Median overall survival (OS) in patients with psPD treated with radiation alone was 15.6 versus 12.8 months in those without psPD. Median OS in patients treated with radiation and concomitant temozolomide who had psPD was 24.4 versus 15.9 months in those who did not have psPD. We were unable to detect a difference in OS between the four groups. Presence of psPD, independent of treatment, was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P = 0.05) but not OS. psPD may be more common in combination therapy but most likely by a small margin.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19221865
"""Evaluation of Glioblastoma Response to Therapy With Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer.""","""Purpose: To monitor cellular and metabolic characteristics of glioblastoma (GBM) over the course of standard 6-week chemoradiation treatment with chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI; and to identify the earliest time point CEST could determine subsequent therapeutic response. Methods and materials: Nineteen patients with newly diagnosed GBM were recruited, and CEST-MRI was acquired immediately before (Day0), 2 weeks (Day14) and 4 weeks (Day28) into treatment, and 1 month after the end of treatment (Day70). Several CEST metrics, including magnetization transfer ratio and area under the curve of CEST peaks corresponding to nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and amide protons (MTRNOE, MTRAmide, CESTNOE, and CESTAmide respectively), magnetization transfer (MT), and direct water effect were investigated. Lack of early progression was determined as no increase in tumor size or worsening of clinical symptoms according to routine post-chemoradiation serial structural MRI. Results: Changes in MTRNOE (nonprogressors = 1.35 ± 0.18, progressors = 0.97 ± 0.22, P = .006) and MTRAmide (nonprogressors = 1.25 ± 0.17, progressors = 0.99 ± 0.10, P = .017) between baseline (Day0) and Day14 resulted in the best separation of nonprogressors from progressors. Moreover, the baseline (Day0) MTRNOE (nonprogressors = 6.5% ± 1.6%, progressors = 9.1% ± 2.1%, P = .015), MTRAmide (nonprogressors = 6.7% ± 1.7%, progressors = 8.9% ± 1.9%, P = .028), MT (nonprogressors = 3.8% ± 0.9%, progressors = 5.4% ± 1.4%, P = .019), and CESTNOE (nonprogressors = 4.1%ċHz ± 1.7%ċHz, progressors = 6.1%ċHz ± 1.9%ċHz, P = .044) were able to identify progressors even before the start of the treatment. Conclusions: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) provides imaging-based biomarkers of GBM response as early as 2 weeks into the treatment. Certain CEST metrics can characterize tumor aggressiveness and identify early progressors even before beginning the treatment. Such an early biomarker of response may allow for adjusting the GBM treatment plan for adaptive radiation therapy in early progressors and more confidently continuing standard adjuvant treatment for nonprogressors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893279

"""Repopulation capacity during fractionated irradiation of squamous cell carcinomas and glioblastomas in vitro.""","""Purpose: Determination of clonogenic cell proliferation of three highly malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and two glioblastoma cell lines during a 20-day course of fractionated irradiation under in vitro conditions. Methods and materials: Tumor cells in exponential growth phase were plated in 24-well plastic flasks and irradiated 24 h after plating with 250 kV x-rays at room temperature. Six fractions with single doses between 0.6 and 9 Gy were administered in 1.67, 5, 10, 15, and 20 days. Colony growth was monitored for at least 60 days after completion of irradiation. Wells with confluent colonies were considered as 'recurrences' and wells without colonies as 'controlled.' The dose required to control 50% of irradiated wells (WCD50) was estimated by a logistic regression for the different overall treatment times. The effective doubling time of clonogenic cells (T[eff]) was determined by a direct fit using the maximum likelihood method. Results: The increase of WCD50 within 18.3 days was highly significant for all tumor cell lines accounting for 7.9 and 12.0 Gy in the two glioblastoma cell lines and for 12.7, 14.0, and 21.7 Gy in the three SCC cell lines. The corresponding T(eff)s were 4.4 and 2.0 days for glioblastoma cell lines and 2.4, 4.2, and 1.8 days for SCC cell lines. Population doubling times (PDT) of untreated tumor cells ranged from 1.0 to 1.9 days, showing no correlation with T(eff)s. T(eff) was significantly longer than PDT in three of five tumor cell lines. No significant differences were observed comparing glioblastomas and SCC. Increase of WCD50 with time did not correlate with T(eff) but with T(eff) InSF2 (surviving fraction at 2 Gy). Conclusion: The intrinsic ability of SCC and glioblastoma cells to repopulate during fractionated irradiation could be demonstrated. Repopulation induced dose loss per day depends on T(eff) and intrinsic radiation sensitivity. Proliferation during treatment was decelerated compared to pretreatment PDT in the majority of cell lines. Pretreatment cell kinetics did not predict for tumor cell proliferation during treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9336158
"""Immunotherapy for glioblastoma: concepts and challenges.""","""Purpose of review: Immunotherapy is an emerging treatment strategy against various cancer types including glioblastoma. It comprises different strategies to induce, boost or restore an antitumor immune response. This review provides an overview of recent preclinical and clinical developments in the field of immunotherapy against glioblastoma. We elucidate the concepts and challenges and point out the strengths and weaknesses of the most promising immunotherapeutic approaches. Recent findings: Immunotherapy is one of the most active research areas in glioblastoma. Data from preclinical work as well as phase I and phase II clinical trials revealed that immunotherapy against glioblastoma is overall well tolerated and able to promote a potent antitumor immune response. Among the therapeutic approaches that are currently under investigation, vaccination, for example, against the variant III of epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as immune checkpoint inhibition targeting receptors such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 and programmed cell death-1, are among the most promising and advanced treatment strategies. However, there are considerable challenges to overcome such as the identification of novel target molecules for vaccination, appropriate patient selection criteria, strategies to prevent or handle immune-related adverse events, and the implementation of immunotherapy in multimodal treatment regimens together with conventional treatment strategies. Summary: Key features of immunotherapy are target specificity, adaptability, and durability. Results from preclinical assessments and clinical trials applying immunotherapy alone or in combination with conventional treatment options are promising. However, intense research and stringent clinical development are required to optimize the available treatment options and to overcome potential pitfalls.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402401

Forty patients underwent at least one craniotomy, following which 22.5% achieved a gross total resection, 23 had biopsy only. Only age and gross total resection of tumor as judged by postoperative MR (CT in 2 cases) correlated significantly with outcome. The subtotal craniotomy group and biopsy only cohort were indistinguishable (median survival 11 vs. 10 months, respectively). Although craniotomy associated with gross total resection results in enhanced survival (median 27 months), subtotal tumor excision offers little beyond a diagnosis.

However, the specific physical and chemical characteristics of the sponge that can be used for GBMs have not been reported as far as we know. Therefore, this study aims to develop a simple yet robust method to select a candidate sponge medium and verify its safety in advanced concurrent TTFields and radiotherapy for GBMs through interdisciplinary investigation among materials science, medical physics, and clinical radiation oncology. Significantly, latex-free polyurethane (PU) sponges with a Hounsfield unit (HU) value lower than -750, which exhibit almost no negative influence on planning computed tomography (CT) imaging and radiotherapy dosimetry, are demonstrated to be available for concurrent TTFields and radiotherapy for GBMs. Moreover, in clinical research, the achieved clear CT images, negligible scalp toxicity, lower residual positioning errors, and high compliant rate of 82% over the selected representative sponge sample corroborate the availability and safety of PU sponges in practical applications for GBM treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37882243

The major obstacles to the successful use of chemotherapy for CNS tumors are the drug delivery to the tumor site and the infusion of chemotherapeutic agents directly into the arterial supply of a tumor. The latter could provide a pharmacokinetic advantage by enhancing drug delivery to the tumor. Sixteen patients with recurrent unilateral glioblastomas treated with intra-arterial BCNU were evaluated retrospectively. During the infusion, eleven patients referred pain in the ipsilateral eye, five patients were nauseated, three reported headache, one patient presented mental confusion, while two presented focal signs. There were two deaths during the course of therapy. Four patients achieved temporary clinical improvement, seven showed disease stability, and three presented clinical deterioration. The median total survival time was 87.9 weeks. Unilateral vision loss and focal signs were observed as delayed complications of this treatment.

In contrast, a left frontal lesion with low regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and metabolic glucose rate was presumed to be rather hypodynamic and hypometabolic. Histological examination of these isolated masses showed both to be glioblastomas, and, as predicted by the PET findings, there were minor histological distinctions. In repeated PET scans following postoperative combined radiochemotherapy, metabolic glucose rate values at the thalamic tumor decreased to about 50% the levels before therapy, although there was no distinguishable change in tumor size on the concurrent computerized tomography scans.

Materials and methods: All animal experiments were approved by the animal committee and adhered to the experimental animal care guidelines. A 400-kHz focused ultrasound generator was used to transcranially disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rat brains by delivering burst-tone ultrasound energy in the presence of microbubbles. The process was monitored in vivo by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Cultured C6 glioma cells implanted in Sprague-Dawley rats were used as the tumor model. BCNU (13.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and its concentration in brains was quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography. MR imaging was used to evaluate the effect of treatments longitudinally, including analysis of tumor progression and animal survival, and brain tissues were histologically examined. Methods including the two-tailed unpaired t test and the Mantel-Cox test were used for statistical analyses, with a significance level of .05. Results: Focused ultrasound significantly enhanced the penetration of BCNU through the BBB in normal (by 340%) and tumor-implanted (by 202%) brains without causing hemorrhaging. Treatment of tumor-implanted rats with focused ultrasound alone had no beneficial effect on tumor progression or on animal survival up to 60 days. Administration of BCNU only transiently controlled tumor progression; nevertheless, relative to untreated controls, animal survival was improved by treatment with BCNU alone (increase in median survival time [IST(median)], 15.7%, P = .023). Treatment with focused ultrasound before BCNU administration controlled tumor progression (day 31: 0.05 cm(3) + or - 0.1 [standard deviation] vs 0.28 cm(3) + or - 0.1) and improved animal survival relative to untreated controls (IST(median), 85.9%, P = .0015).

"""Age and radiation response in glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Objective: Advanced age is a strong predictor of shorter survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GM), especially for those who receive multimodality treatment. Radiographically assessed tumor response to external beam radiation therapy is an important prognostic factor in GM. We hypothesized that older GM patients might have more radioresistant tumors. Methods: We studied radiographically assessed response to external beam radiation treatment (five-level scale) in relation to age and other prognostic factors in a cohort of 301 GM patients treated on two prospective clinical protocols. A total of 223 patients (74%) were assessable for radiographically assessed radiation response. A proportional odds ordinal regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Younger age (P = 0.006), higher Karnofsky Performance Scale score before radiotherapy (P = 0.027), and more extensive surgical resection (P = 0.028) predicted better radiation response in univariate analyses. Results were similar when clinical criteria were used to classify an additional 61 patients without radiographically assessed radiation response (stable versus progressive disease). In multivariate analyses, age and extent of resection were significant independent predictors of radiation response (P < 0.05); Karnofsky Performance Scale score was of borderline significance (P = 0.07). Conclusion: Older GM patients are less likely to have good responses to postoperative external beam radiation therapy.

"""Low-dose irradiated mesenchymal stromal cells break tumor defensive properties in vivo.""","""Solid tumors, including gliomas, still represent a challenge to clinicians and first line treatments often fail, calling for new paradigms in cancer therapy. Novel strategies to overcome tumor resistance are mainly represented by multi-targeted approaches, and cell vector-based therapy is one of the most promising treatment modalities under development. Here, we show that mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), when primed with low-dose irradiation (irMSCs), undergo changes in their immunogenic and angiogenic capacity and acquire anti-tumoral properties in a mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM). Following grafting in GL261 glioblastoma, irMSCs migrate extensively and selectively within the tumor and infiltrate predominantly the peri-vascular niche, leading to rejection of established tumors and cure in 29% of animals. The therapeutic radiation dose window is narrow, with effects seen between 2 and 15 Gy, peaking at 5 Gy. A single low-dose radiation decreases MSCs inherent immune suppressive properties in vitro as well as shapes their immune regulatory ability in vivo. Intra-tumorally grafted irMSCs stimulate the immune system and decrease immune suppression. Additionally, irMSCs enhance peri-tumoral reactive astrocytosis and display anti-angiogenic properties. Hence, the present study provides strong evidence for a therapeutic potential of low-dose irMSCs in cancer as well as giving new insight into MSC biology and applications.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29752716
"""Sonodynamic Therapy for the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme in a Mouse Model Using a Portable Benchtop Focused Ultrasound System.""","""Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an application of focused ultrasound (FUS) that enables a sonosensitizing agent to prime tumors for increased sensitivity during sonication. Unfortunately, current clinical treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) are lacking, leading to low long-term survival rates among patients. SDT is a promising method for treating GBM in an effective, noninvasive, and tumor-specific manner. Sonosensitizers preferentially enter tumor cells compared to the surrounding brain parenchyma. The application of FUS in the presence of a sonosensitizing agent generates reactive oxidative species resulting in apoptosis. Although this therapy has been shown previously to be effective in preclinical studies, there is a lack of established standardized parameters. Standardized methods are necessary to optimize this therapeutic strategy for preclinical and clinical use. In this paper, we detail the protocol to perform SDT in a preclinical GBM rodent model using magnetic resonance-guided FUS (MRgFUS). MRgFUS is an important feature of this protocol, as it allows for specific targeting of a brain tumor without the need for invasive surgeries (e.g., craniotomy). The benchtop device used here can focus on a specific location in three dimensions by clicking on a target on an MRI image, making target selection a straightforward process. This protocol will provide researchers with a standardized preclinical method for MRgFUS SDT, with the added flexibility to change and optimize parameters for translational research.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36847383

Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis and included 31 patients with overlapping glioblastomas (OG) who showed WHO IV in the initial histopathological examination. All patients fulfilled criteria of overlapping glioblastomas in the MRI according to WHO criteria (3 or more lobes were affected). We evaluated Karnofsky performance score (KPS), gender, age, IDH-1_R132H status, MGMT promotor methylation status, proliferation index, postoperative therapy, biopsy vs. partial resection and extent of resection as possible factors affecting overall survival (OAS). A matched pair analysis was performed between the biopsy and resection group on basis of age, KPS and combined radio-chemotherapy. Results: 10 Patients underwent resection of the contrast enhancing tumor parts, 21 patients underwent stereotactic biopsy. All included patients showed contrast enhancing lesions in the MRI. Median age was 61 years in the biopsy-group and 53 in the partial resection (PR) group. We found a significant correlation between OAS and age <50 (p=0.02). Median KPS was 80 in the STX group vs. 100 in the PR group. KPS above 80 was significantly associated with longer OAS (p=0.02).

With the field constantly expanding-more than 20 viruses have been recognized as potential oncolytic viruses-new virus candidates continue to emerge even as established viruses reach clinical trials. They all share the defining commonalities of selective replication in tumors, subsequent tumor cell lysis, and dispersion within the tumor. Members from diverse virus classes with distinctly different biologies and host species have been identified. Of these viruses, 15 have been tested on human glioblastoma multiforme. So far, 20 clinical trials have been conducted or initiated using attenuated strains of 7 different oncolytic viruses against glioblastoma multiforme. In this review, we present an overview of viruses that have been developed or considered for glioblastoma multiforme treatment. We outline the principles of tumor targeting and selective viral replication, which include mechanisms of tumor-selective binding, and molecular elements usurping cellular biosynthetic machinery in transformed cells. Results from clinical trials have clearly established the proof of concept and have confirmed the general safety of oncolytic virus application in the brain. The moderate clinical efficacy has not yet matched the promising preclinical lab results; next-generation oncolytic viruses that are either 'armed' with therapeutic genes or embedded in a multimodality treatment regimen should enhance the clinical results.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22290260
"""Preclinical outcomes of Intratumoral Modulation Therapy for glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the leading cause of high fatality cancer arising within the adult brain. Electrotherapeutic approaches offer new promise for GBM treatment by exploiting innate vulnerabilities of cancer cells to low intensity electric fields. This report describes the preclinical outcomes of a novel electrotherapeutic strategy called Intratumoral Modulation Therapy (IMT) that uses an implanted stimulation system to deliver sustained, titratable, low intensity electric fields directly across GBM-affected brain regions. This pilot technology was applied to in vitro and animal models demonstrating significant and marked reduction in tumor cell viability and a cumulative impact of concurrent IMT and chemotherapy in GBM. No off target neurological effects were observed in treated subjects. Computational modeling predicted IMT field optimization as a means to further bolster treatment efficacy. This sentinel study provides new support for defining the potential of IMT strategies as part of a more effective multimodality treatment platform for GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29740075
"""Pathological findings and prognostic factors in recurrent glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas, which are the most common primary intracranial tumor, are associated with the poorest survival time, which is typically 1-2 years. Age at initial diagnosis, Karnofsky performance score, and O(6)-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status are the most well-documented predictors of survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Few studies have examined prognostic factors in patients with recurrent glioblastomas. At relapse, the pathological features of glioblastomas are affected by tumor regrowth and the influence of chemoradiotherapy during the initial treatment. Morphological transformations at recurrence include quantitative changes in tumor cells, such as the presence of giant cells and gemistocytic cell formation, radiation necrosis, and vascular structural changes. Therefore, we should carefully examine pathological findings at recurrence. In this report, we analyzed MGMT promoter status, the MIB-1 index, and the pathology of tumor samples at the first (primary tumor) and second (recurrent tumor) surgeries and clarified prognostic factors in patients with recurrent cases. In the multivariate analysis, we showed that MIB-1 indexes at the time of the second surgery (p = 0.004) persisted as a significant independent prognostic factor in survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22331317
"""Outcome and toxicity profile of salvage low-dose-rate iodine-125 stereotactic brachytherapy in recurrent high-grade gliomas.""","""Background: The aim of this study was to provide an outcome and toxicity profile of salvage low-dose-rate iodine-125 (I-125) stereotactic brachytherapy (SBT) in patients with small, circumscribed malignant glioma recurrences. Methods: Patients with malignant glioma recurrences consecutively undergoing salvage SBT from 2003 to 2011 were identified from our prospective tumor database. SBT was considered a potentially suitable treatment strategy for adult mostly multimodally pretreated patients (Karnofsky score of ≥ 70) with biopsy-proven, circumscribed, small (diameter ≤ 3.5 cm) recurrences. Exclusively temporary I-125 seeds were used (reference dose: 50 Gy, dose rate: < 15 cGy/h). Study endpoints were time-to-treatment failure (TTF) after SBT, postrecurrence survival (PRS), and toxicity. Survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Adverse events were categorized according to the RTOG/EORTC classification. Prognostic factors were obtained from proportional hazards models. Results: Sixty-eight patients (28 WHO grade III, 40 WHO grade IV gliomas) were included. Fifty-nine patients had previously received external beam radiation. Median TTF and PRS were 8.3 months and 13.4 months, respectively. TTF and PRS were longer for grade III gliomas than for glioblastomas (15.0 vs. 6.2 months and 28.1 vs. 9.3 months, respectively). Patients with grade III tumors were younger (p = 0.002). Favorable factors for TTF and PRS were age ≤ 50 years and a methylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-promoter. Alternative models including tumor grade instead of age reached a similar good fit. Three patients suffered from grade I, one from grade II, and two from grade IV toxicity. Conclusions: Salvage SBT is feasible and safe even after previously performed external beam radiation. Favorable outcome measurements in particular for grade III recurrences deserve further prospective evaluation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26298594
"""Targeting DUSPs in glioblastomas - wielding a double-edged sword?""","""Several dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that play key roles in the direct or indirect inactivation of different MAP kinases (MAPKs) have been implicated in human cancers over the past decade. This has led to a growing interest in identifying DUSPs and their specific inhibitors for further testing and validation as therapeutic targets in human cancers. However, the lack of understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms and cross-talks between MAPK signaling pathways, combined with the fact that DUSPs can act as a double-edged sword in cancer progression, calls for a more careful and thorough investigation. Among the various types of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notorious for its aggressiveness and resistance to current treatment modalities. This has led to the search for new molecular targets, particularly those involving various signaling pathways. DUSPs appear to be a promising target, but much more information on DUSP targets and their effects on GBM is needed before potential therapies can be developed, tested, and validated. This review identifies and summarize the specific roles of DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 and DUSP26 that have been implicated in GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24155099
"""Tumor treating field therapy in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.""","""A novel device that employs TTF therapy has recently been developed and is currently in use for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). It was FDA approved in April 2011 for the treatment of patients 22 years or older with rGBM. The device delivers alternating electric fields and is programmed to ensure maximal tumor cell kill. Glioblastoma is the most common type of glioma and has an estimated incidence of approximately 10,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. This tumor is particularly resistant to treatment and is uniformly fatal especially in the recurrent setting. Prior to the approval of the TTF System, the only FDA approved treatment for rGBM was bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein that drives tumor angiogenesis. By blocking the VEGF pathway, bevacizumab can result in a significant radiographic response (pseudoresponse), improve progression free survival and reduce corticosteroid requirements in rGBM patients. Bevacizumab however failed to prolong overall survival in a recent phase III trial. A pivotal phase III trial (EF-11) demonstrated comparable overall survival between physicians' choice chemotherapy and TTF Therapy but better quality of life were observed in the TTF arm. There is currently an unmet need to develop novel approaches designed to prolong overall survival and/or improve quality of life in this unfortunate patient population. One appealing approach would be to combine the two currently approved treatment modalities namely bevacizumab and TTF Therapy. These two treatments are currently approved as monotherapy, but their combination has never been evaluated in a clinical trial. We have developed an approach for combining those two treatment modalities and treated 2 rGBM patients. Here we describe a detailed methodology outlining this novel treatment protocol and present representative data from one of the treated patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25407354
"""Does gender matter in glioblastoma?""","""BACKGROUND The clinical outcome of glioblastoma (GBM) patients who receive radiotherapy alone or with chemotherapy is well established. However, little is known about how many patients do not receive this treatment. We consider it is important to investigate why a proportion of operated patients do not receive further treatment after surgery. METHODS We reviewed all consecutive GBM patients operated on in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2008. RESULTS A total of 216 patients with GBM were identified. Fifty-five (25%) did not receive any treatment after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that factors associated with no further treatment after surgery were older than 60 years (p=0.002), of female gender (p=0.03), had a KPS<70 (p<0.001) and had had a biopsy (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that age =60 years and KPS <70 were independent predictors of no further treatment after surgery. Gender was not an independent variable. However, women in the whole series were older than 60 years (p=0.01), and they had a worse KPS (p=0.02) and more biopsies (p=0.04) than men. In the whole group, median survival time was 10.4 months for men (n=125) vs. 7.2 months for women (n=91), log rank p<0.04. This difference was not observed in the group that was treated after surgery. CONCLUSIONS One out of four patients could not be treated after surgery. Independent predictors were older age and low KPS. These poor risk variables were more frequent in women and their survival was therefore lower than men in our series.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21975336
"""Effects of Postoperative Intravenous Cyclosporine Treatment on the Survival and Functional Performance Status of Patients With Glioblastoma: A Randomized, Triple-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.""","""Background: Glioblastoma is associated with low median survival time irrespective of maximal treatment. Previous in vitro studies have revealed tumor inhibitory effect of cyclosporine A. However, whether the addition of cyclosporine could improve survival among patients with glioblastoma is unknown. This study aimed to determine the impact of postoperation treatment with cyclosporine on the survival and performance status. Methods: In this randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 118 patients with glioblastoma who underwent surgery were treated with standard chemoradiotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous cyclosporine for 3 days postoperatively or placebo during the same period. The primary endpoint was the short-term effect of intravenous cyclosporine on survival and Karnofsky performance scores. Secondary endpoints were chemoradiotherapy toxicity and neuroimaging features. Results: The overall survival (OS) in the cyclosporine (17.03 ± 5.8, 95% confidence interval: 11-17.37 months) group was statistically lower than in the placebo (30.53 ± 4.9, 95% confidence interval: 8-32.3 months) groups (P = 0.049). However, compared to the placebo group, a statistically higher percentage of patients in the cyclosporine group were alive at 12 months follow-up. Also, progression-free survival in the cyclosporine group was significantly prolonged than in the placebo group (6.3 ± 4.07 months vs. 3.4 ± 2.98 months, P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, age <50 years (P = 0.022) and gross total resection (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with OS. Conclusions: Our study results demonstrated that administering postoperative cyclosporine does not improve OS and functional performance status.

Such cancer patients usually survive for one year under treatment. Recently, the role of small non-coding RNA known as microRNAs (miRNA), have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, as miRNAs play a critical role in the tumor-forming processes. The change in expression levels of several miRNAs has been found in GBM patients within last 10 years. It is evident now that impairment of miRNA regulation is one of the key mechanisms in GBM pathogenesis. The miRNA deregulation is involved in many processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, invasion, glioma stem cell behavior, and angiogenesis.

The current guidelines recommend active treatment in elderly patients in cases with a KPS of at least 60%. We established a score for selecting patients with a very poor prognosis from patients with a better prognosis. Methods: One hundred eighty one patients ≥65 years old, histologically diagnosed with GBM, were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical characteristics were analysed for their impact on the overall survival (OS). Factors which were significant in univariate analysis (log-rank test, p < 0.05) were included in a multi-variate model (multi-variate Cox regression analysis, MVA). The 9-month OS for the significant factors after MVA (p < 0.05) was included in a prognostic score. Score sums with a median OS of < and > 6 months were summarized as Group A and B, respectively. Results: Age, KPS, MGMT status, the extent of resection, aphasia after surgery and motor dysfunction after surgery were significantly associated with OS on univariate analysis (p < 0.05). On MVA age (p 0.002), MGMT promotor methylation (p 0.013) and Karnofsky performance status (p 0.005) remained significant and were included in the score. Patients were divided into two groups, group A (median OS of 2.7 months) and group B (median OS of 7.8 months). The score was of prognostic significance, independent of the adjuvant treatment regimen. Conclusions: The score distinguishes patients with a poor prognosis from patients with a better prognosis.

Methods: Patients with rGBM (n = 72) received VB-111 in 4 treatment groups: subtherapeutic (VB-111 dose escalation), limited exposure (LE; VB-111 monotherapy until progression), primed combination (VB-111 monotherapy continued upon progression with combination of bevacizumab), and unprimed combination (upfront combination of VB-111 and bevacizumab). The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were safety, overall response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: VB-111 was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was transient mild-moderate fever. Median OS time was significantly longer in the primed combination group compared with both LE (414 vs 223 days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; P = 0.043) and unprimed combination (414 vs 141.5 days; HR, 0.24; P = 0.0056).

"""Immunotherapy for primary brain tumors: no longer a matter of privilege.""","""Immunotherapy for cancer continues to gain both momentum and legitimacy as a rational mode of therapy and a vital treatment component in the emerging era of personalized medicine. Gliomas, and their most malignant form, glioblastoma, remain as a particularly devastating solid tumor for which standard treatment options proffer only modest efficacy and target specificity. Immunotherapy would seem a well-suited choice to address such deficiencies given both the modest inherent immunogenicity of gliomas and the strong desire for treatment specificity within the confines of the toxicity-averse normal brain. This review highlights the caveats and challenges to immunotherapy for primary brain tumors, as well as reviewing modalities that are currently used or are undergoing active investigation. Tumor immunosuppressive countermeasures, peculiarities of central nervous system immune access, and opportunities for rational treatment design are discussed.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25398845
"""Effect of human skin-derived stem cells on vessel architecture, tumor growth, and tumor invasion in brain tumor animal models.""","""Glioblastomas represent an important cause of cancer-related mortality with poor survival. Despite many advances, the mean survival time has not significantly improved in the last decades. New experimental approaches have shown tumor regression after the grafting of neural stem cells and human mesenchymal stem cells into experimental intracranial gliomas of adult rodents. However, the cell source seems to be an important limitation for autologous transplantation in glioblastoma. In the present study, we evaluated the tumor targeting and antitumor activity of human skin-derived stem cells (hSDSCs) in human brain tumor models. The hSDSCs exhibit tumor targeting characteristics in vivo when injected into the controlateral hemisphere or into the tail vein of mice. When implanted directly into glioblastomas, hSDSCs distributed themselves extensively throughout the tumor mass, reduced tumor vessel density, and decreased angiogenic sprouts. In addition, transplanted hSDSCs differentiate into pericyte cell and release high amounts of human transforming growth factor-beta1 with low expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which may contribute to the decreased tumor cell invasion and number of tumor vessels. In long-term experiments, the hSDSCs were also able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to prolong animal survival. Similar behavior was seen when hSDSCs were implanted into two different tumor models, the chicken embryo experimental glioma model and the transgenic Tyrp1-Tag mice. Taken together, these data validate the use of hSDSCs for targeting human brain tumors. They may represent therapeutically effective cells for the treatment of intracranial tumors after autologous transplantation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17409412
"""18F-FET PET for planning of thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles in recurrent glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Thermotherapy using magnetic nanoparticles (nano cancer therapy) is a new concept of local tumour therapy, which is based on controlled heating of intra-tumoural injected magnetic nanoparticles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PET with a recently introduced amino acid tracer O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-]L-tyrosine (FET) for targeting the nanoparticles implantation. Materials and methods: Eleven patients with glioblastoma recurrences underwent MR and FET-PET imaging for planning of the nano cancer therapy. Thereafter, the gross tumour volumes (GTV) were defined, taking into consideration the results of both imaging tools. Results: The MRI-based mean GTV was 24.3 cm3 (range 2.5-59.7) and the PET-based mean GTV 31.9 cm3 (range 5.2-77.9). On the average the MRI identified an additional 8.9 +/- 4.7 cm3 and the FET-PET scan-an additional 16.5 +/- 15.2 cm3 outside of the common GTV (15.4 +/- 11.0 cm3). The mean final GTV accounted to 33.8 cm3 (range, 5.2-77.9). The additional information of FET-PET led to an increase in GTV by 22-286% in eight patients and to a decrease of 23% and 26%, respectively, in two patients. In one patient, the final GTV was defined on the basis of MRI data only. Conclusions: FET-PET adds important information on the actual tumour volume in recurrent glioblastomas and is highly valuable for defining the target volume for the nano cancer therapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16754352
"""Electrotherapies for Glioblastoma.""","""Non-thermal, intermediate frequency (100-500 kHz) electrotherapies present a unique therapeutic strategy to treat malignant neoplasms. Here, pulsed electric fields (PEFs) which induce reversible or irreversible electroporation (IRE) and tumour-treating fields (TTFs) are reviewed highlighting the foundations, advances, and considerations of each method when applied to glioblastoma (GBM). Several biological aspects of GBM that contribute to treatment complexity (heterogeneity, recurrence, resistance, and blood-brain barrier(BBB)) and electrophysiological traits which are suggested to promote glioma progression are described. Particularly, the biological responses at the cellular and molecular level to specific parameters of the electrical stimuli are discussed offering ways to compare these parameters despite the lack of a universally adopted physical description. Reviewing the literature, a disconnect is found between electrotherapy techniques and how they target the biological complexities of GBM that make treatment difficult in the first place. An attempt is made to bridge the interdisciplinary gap by mapping biological characteristics to different methods of electrotherapy, suggesting important future research topics and directions in both understanding and treating GBM.

"""Validation of an amino-acid-based radionuclide therapy plus external beam radiotherapy in heterotopic glioblastoma models.""","""Background and purpose: Malignant gliomas represent a major therapeutic challenge because no efficient treatment is currently available. p-[(131)I]iodo-L-phenylalanine ([(131)I]IPA) is a glioma avid radiopharmaceutical that demonstrated antiproliferative and tumoricidal effects in gliomas. The present study validated the therapeutic efficiency of [(131)I]IPA combined with external beam radiotherapy in experimental gliomas. Materials and methods: Glioma cells derived from the primary human A1207, T5135, Tx3868 and M059K glioblastoma cell lines or rat F98 glioma cell line were treated with various doses of [(131)I]IPA, external photon irradiation (RT) or combined [(131)I]IPA/RT treatment. Responsiveness of glioma cells to the different therapy modalities was investigated at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatments by trypan blue, WST-1 assay, propidium iodide and bisbenzimide staining as well as by clonogenic assay. In addition, the therapy-induced DNA damage and repair were evaluated using phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX). In vivo, the effectiveness of the combination treatment was validated in human Tx3868 and A1207 glioblastoma xenografts in CD1 nu/nu mice and RNU rats. Results: In vitro, the combination treatment resulted in a greater than additive increase in cytotoxic effect in glioma cell lines. Cell survival rate following a treatment with 1.0 μCi (37 kBq) of [(131)I]IPA amounted to 70%±15% and 60%±10% after 48 and 72 h, respectively, and decreased under 20% after additional RT with 5 Gy. At higher RT doses, cell survival rate decreased below 5%. As a measure of DNA double-strand break, nuclear γ-H2AX foci were determined as a function of time. Within 24 h, the number of γ-H2AX foci per cell was significantly greater after combined modality compared with the individual treatments. In vivo, when combined with RT, the radionuclide therapy with [(131)I]IPA resulted in an extended tumor growth delay, a reduction of the initial tumor volume and an enhanced radiosensitivity in Tx3868 and A1207 glioblastoma xenografts in CD1 nu/nu mice and RNU rats. On day 90 after monotherapy with [(131)I]IPA (20 MBq) or RT (20 Gy), 35%-50% of the treated rats were still alive. In comparison, up to 70%-80% survival rates were registered after combined [(131)I]IPA/RT treatment on day 100 for all animal models. Conclusions: These preclinical data convincingly demonstrated that [(131)I]IPA plus external beam photon radiotherapy is a safe and highly effective treatment for experimental gliomas, which may merit a clinical trial to ascertain its potential as a therapeutic approach in patients. As only a low [(131)I]IPA activity and a low RT dose were applied, further optimization strategies should be pursued experimentally, including application of higher radiation doses and conventional fractionated regimens or use of methods aiming to increase target doses and maximize dose effects.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531282

Here, we present the new avenues in phytocompound research for the improvement of glioblastoma therapy, including the ways to enhance the response to temozolomide using phytochemicals, the current focus on phytocompound-based immunotherapy, or the use of phytocompounds as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. Moreover, we present new, intensively evaluated approaches, such as chemical modifications of phytochemicals or encapsulation into numerous types of nanoformulations, to improve their bioavailability and delivery to the brain. Finally, we present the clinical trials evaluating the role of phytocompounds or phytocompound-derived drugs in glioblastoma therapy and the less studied phytocompounds or plant extracts that have only recently been found to possess promising anti-glioblastoma properties.

"""Patterns of relapse in glioblastoma multiforme following concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide.""","""Objective: Different methods for contouring target volumes are currently in use in the UK when irradiating glioblastomas post operatively. Both one- and two-phase techniques are offered at different centres. 90% of relapses are recognised to occur locally when using radiotherapy alone. The objective of this evaluation was to determine the pattern of relapse following concomitant radiotherapy with temozolomide (RT-TMZ). Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients receiving RT-TMZ between 2006 and 2010 was performed. Outcome data including survival were calculated from the start of radiotherapy. Analysis of available serial cross-sectional imaging was performed from diagnosis to first relapse. The site of first relapse was defined by the relationship to primary disease. Central relapse was defined as progression of the primary enhancing mass or the appearance of a new enhancing nodule within 2 cm. Results: 105 patients were identified as receiving RT-TMZ. 34 patients were not eligible for relapse analysis owing to either lack of progression or unsuitable imaging. Patterns of first relapse were as follows: 55 (77%) patients relapsed centrally within 2 cm of the original gadolinium-enhanced mass on MRI, 13 (18%) patients relapsed >4 cm from the original enhancement and 3 (4%) relapsed within the contralateral hemisphere. Conclusion: Central relapse remains the predominant pattern of failure following RT-TMZ. Single-phase conformal radiotherapy using a 2-cm margin from the original contrast-enhanced mass is appropriate for the majority of these patients. Advances in knowledge: Central relapse remains the predominant pattern of failure following chemoradiotherapy for glioblastomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23385995
"""Combined modality treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: the role of temozolomide.""","""Despite of improvements in the biological and molecular characterization of glioblastoma multiforme and studies of factors associated with tumor growth and progression, this type of malignant astroglial brain tumor is still difficult to treat. The present article reviews established and emerging prognostic and predictive factors and their potential influence on future therapeutic efforts. Recent developments in standard treatment options (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are summarized. The integration of the oral cytotoxic agent temozolomide into current treatment protocols of postoperative combination therapy with radiation and drugs is discussed, especially in the context of the recently published randomized trial of the EORTC/NCIC, which showed that radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide significantly improved progression-free and overall survival over radiotherapy alone. The study also provided hypotheses about the subgroups, which are most likely to benefit from this reasonably well tolerated regimen. In a subset of patients, investigation of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor tissue was performed. Survival was shorter in patients with unmethylated promoter in both study groups. Patients with methylated promoter treated with radiotherapy had a median survival of 15 months, those treated with radiation plus temozolomide of 22 months (p=0.007). In the unmethylated group, the difference in median survival was only 1 month (p=0.06). Especially for these patients, alternative treatments need to be developed. The optimum schedule of temozolomide administration and the influence of combinations with additional antineoplastic agents remains to be studied.

"""Antiangiogenesis treatment for glioblastoma multiforme: challenges and opportunities.""","""Angiogenesis is a major hallmark of cancer cells, and glioblastomas are among the most angiogenic tumors. The cascade of angiogenesis is probably initiated by hypoxia, leading to the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Both VEGF and bFGF have paracrine effects on endothelial cells, pericytes, or both, causing the formation of hyperpermeable tumor blood vessels. Advanced MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced, dynamic susceptibility, and arterial spin labeling MRI, have provided semiquantitative measurements of tumor vascular permeability and perfusion. A decrease in vascular permeability and perfusion can be detected after antiangiogenesis drug treatment, either with monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab that sequesters VEGF, or small-molecule VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, antiangiogenesis therapies are being increasingly adopted for treating glioblastomas. However, caution must be exercised because neural stem cells are also sensitive to antiangiogenesis drugs and the combined effect of ionizing radiation.

Specific point mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 appear to define molecularly these tumors that are associated with younger age and more favorable outcome; the vast majority of glioblastomas are IDH wild-type. Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) signaling. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. Promoter methylation of the gene encoding the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide and guides choice of first-line treatment in elderly patients.

Low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (LDHRS) seems to be an effective phenomenon to irradiation that can save normal brain fibroblasts. Genistein which is a soy isoflavone can be cytotoxic in some tumor cell lines. So we determined to study the effect of combining these two treatment modalities. Materials and methods: After 30 hours incubation with Genistein in different concentrations on U87MG cell line, proliferation and clonogenicity were conducted by both clonogenic and MTT assays. A conventional 2Gy radiation dose was compared with 10 doses of 0.2Gy gamma irradiation with 3 minutes and 1 hour intervals. Finally, concurrent effect of these modalities was assessed. Results: Based on acquired cell doubling time (30 hours), one doubling time treatment by Genistein could decrease clonogenicity. U87MG cell line exhibited HRS at low dose irradiations. 2Gy irradiation was more effective than ultra-fractionation methods in comparison with control group. All groups with 50uM concentration of Genistein showed decrease in the survival. This decrease compared with control group, in 10x0.2Gy with 3 minutes intervals plus 50uM Genistein was significant and for groups with the same dose of Genistein but along with continuous 2Gy was more significant. Conclusion: In one day treatment regimen, 10x0.2Gy ultra-fractionation with 3 minutes and 1 hour intervals seems to be less effective than conventional 2Gy irradiation, however adding 50uM Genistein can decrease survival more.

Re-irradiation, as one of the most effective treatments in macroscopic rGBM, is withheld in this situation, as uncertainties about the pattern of re-recurrence, the target volume, and also the efficacy of early re-irradiation after GTR exist. Methods: Imaging and clinical data from 26 consecutive patients with GTR of rGBM were analyzed. The spatial pattern of recurrences was analyzed according to the RANO-HGG criteria ('response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria for high-grade gliomas'). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, a systematic review was performed in PubMed. Results: All but 4 patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy after GTR. Progression was diagnosed in 20 of 26 patients and 70% of recurrent tumors occurred adjacent to the resection cavity. The median extension beyond the edge of the resection cavity was 20 mm. Median PFS was 6 months; OS was 12.8 months. We propose a target volume containing the resection cavity and every contrast enhancing lesion as the gross tumor volume (GTV), a spherical margin of 5-10 mm to generate the clinical target volume (CTV), and a margin of 1-3 mm to generate the planning target volume (PTV). Re-irradiation of this volume is deemed to be safe and likely to prolong PFS. Conclusion: Re-irradiation is worth considering also after GTR, as the volumes that need to be treated are limited and re-irradiation has already proven to be a safe treatment option in general. The strategy of early re-irradiation is currently being tested within the GlioCave/NOA 17/Aro 2016/03 trial.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28616821

It is characterized by a highly proliferative population of cells that invade surrounding tissue and that frequently recur after surgical resection and chemotherapy. Over the last decades, a number of promising novel pharmacological approaches have been investigated, but most of them have failed clinical trials due to some side-effects such as toxicity and poor drug delivery to the brain. The major obstacle in the treatment of GBM is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Due to their relatively high molecular weight, most therapeutic drugs fail to cross the BBB from the blood circulation. Objective: This paper sheds light on the characteristics of GBM and the challenges of current pharmacological treatments. A closer look is given to the role of nanotechnology in the field of drug delivery, and its application in the treatment of brain tumors such as GBM. Method: For this purpose, effort was made to select the most recent studies using predefined search criteria that included at least one of the following keywords in the PubMed and Medline databases: glioblastoma, drug delivery, blood-brain barrier, nanotechnology, and nanoparticle.

"""Optimal management of elderly patients with glioblastoma.""","""Median age at diagnosis in patients with glioblastoma (GB) is slowly increasing with an aging population in Western countries, and was 64years in 2006. The number of patients age 65 and older with GB will double in 2030 compared with 2000. Survival in this older cohort of patients is significantly less than seen in younger patients. This may in part be related to more aggressive biology of tumor, reduced use of standard management approaches, increased toxicity of available therapies, and increased presence of comorbidities in this older patient population. Limited data do support the use of more extensive resection in these patients. Randomized data support the use of post-operative radiotherapy (RT) versus supportive care, but do not demonstrate a benefit for the use of the standard 6weeks course of RT over hypofractionated RT given over 3weeks. Preliminary data of randomized studies raise the possibility of temozolomide alone as an option for these patients. The use of 6weeks of RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide has been associated with reasonably good survival in several uncontrolled small series of selected older patients; however, this better outcome may be related to the selection of better prognosis patients rather than the specific therapy utilized. The current National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) CE.6/26062/22061 randomized study of short course RT with or without concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide will help determine the optimal therapy for this older cohort with currently available therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22722053

We recently developed a cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticle conjugated to azademethylcolchicine (CLIO-ICT) to target and eradicate a subpopulation of quiescent cells, glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs), which could be a reason for radioresistance and tumor relapse. The purpose of our study was to investigate if CLIO-ICT has an additive therapeutic effect to enhance the response of GBMs to ionizing radiation. Methods: NSG™ mice bearing human GBMs and C57BL/6J mice bearing murine GBMs received CLIO-ICT, radiation, or combination treatment. The mice underwent pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and histological analysis. Tumor nanoparticle enhancement, tumor flux, microvessel density, GIC, and apoptosis markers were compared between different groups using a one-way ANOVA and two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Additional NSG™ mice underwent survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier curves and a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Results: At 2 weeks post-treatment, BLI and MRI scans revealed significant reduction in tumor size for CLIO-ICT plus radiation treated tumors compared to monotherapy or vehicle-treated tumors. Combining CLIO-ICT with radiation therapy significantly decreased microvessel density, decreased GICs, increased caspase-3 expression, and prolonged the survival of GBM-bearing mice. CLIO-ICT delivery to GBM could be monitored with MRI. and was not significantly different before and after radiation. There was no significant caspase-3 expression in normal brain at therapeutic doses of CLIO-ICT administered. Conclusion: Our data shows additive anti-tumor effects of CLIO-ICT nanoparticles in combination with radiotherapy.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 151 patients who were diagnosed with a glioblastoma between 2007 and 2011 and underwent complete surgical resection closely followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Results: We observed a significant tendency toward communicating hydrocephalus in cases of ventricular opening during surgical tumor resection (Fisher's exact test p<0.001) and a noticeable, although not statistically significant, correlation between the onset of communicating hydrocephalus and evidence of leptomeningeal tumor dissemination (Fisher's exact test p=0.067). Additionally, there was a trend toward frontal tumor location and a larger tumor volume in patients with communicating hydrocephalus. The majority of patients suffering from communicating hydrocephalus received a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt implantation after radiation therapy (63.6%, Fisher's exact test p=0.000). Conclusion: We identified the following risk factors associated with the onset of communicating hydrocephalus in glioblastoma patients: ventricular opening during tumor resection and leptomeningeal tumor dissemination. Shunt implantation seems to be safe and effective in these patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24731571
"""Lumbar puncture-administered resveratrol inhibits STAT3 activation, enhancing autophagy and apoptosis in orthotopic rat glioblastomas.""","""Trans-resveratrol suppresses glioblastoma growth in vitro, but its effects on intracranial glioblastomas remain untested. Resveratrol crosses the blood-brain barrier, and lumbar puncture (LP) greatly increases its bioavailability in rat brains; therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of LP-administered resveratrol on orthotopic rat glioblastomas. Twenty-four tumor-bearing rats were separated into two groups: Group 1 receiving 100 μl saline containing 0.3% DMSO and Group 2 receiving 100 μl resveratrol (300 μM). Treatments started 3 days after transplantation in 2-day intervals until death. Intracranial drug availabilities, tumor sizes, average life spans and the impacts on STAT3 signaling, apoptosis and autophagy rates were evaluated. MRI imaging revealed that average tumor size in the LP group (495.8 ± 22.3 mm2) was smaller than the control groups (810.3 ± 56.4 mm2; P<0.05). The mean survival time in the LP group (22.2 ± 2.1 d) was longer than control animals (16.0 ± 1.8 d; P<0.05). LP resveratrol-treated glioblastomas showed less Cyclin D1 staining, enhanced autophagy with up-regulated LC3 and Beclin1 expression, and widely distributed apoptotic foci around tumor capillaries with suppressed STAT3 expression and nuclear translocation. In conclusion, LP-delivered resveratrol efficiently inhibited orthotopic rat glioblastoma growth by inactivating STAT3 signaling and enhancing autophagy and apoptosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27716625
"""Glioblastoma therapy with cytotoxic mesenchymal stromal cells optimized by bioluminescence imaging of tumor and therapeutic cell response.""","""Genetically modified adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) with tumor homing capacity have been proposed for localized therapy of chemo- and radiotherapy resistant glioblastomas. We demonstrate an effective procedure to optimize glioblastoma therapy based on the use of genetically modified hAMSCs and in vivo non invasive monitoring of tumor and therapeutic cells. Glioblastoma U87 cells expressing Photinus pyralis luciferase (Pluc) were implanted in combination with hAMSCs expressing a trifunctional Renilla reniformis luciferase-red fluorescent protein-thymidine kinase reporter in the brains of SCID mice that were subsequently treated with ganciclovir (GCV). The resulting optimized therapy was effective and monitoring of tumor cells by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) showed that after 49 days GCV treatment reduced significantly the hAMSC treated tumors; by a factor of 10(4) relative to controls. Using a Pluc reporter regulated by an endothelial specific promoter and in vivo BLI to image hAMSC differentiation we gained insight on the therapeutic mechanism. Implanted hAMSCs homed to tumor vessels, where they differentiated to endothelial cells. We propose that the tumor killing efficiency of genetically modified hAMSCs results from their association with the tumor vascular system and should be useful vehicles to deliver localized therapy to glioblastoma surgical borders following tumor resection.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22529983
"""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in the elderly: initial treatment strategy and overall survival.""","""The EORTC trial which solidified the role of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) plus temozolomide (TMZ) in the management of GBM excluded patients over age 70. Randomized studies of elderly patients showed that hypofractionated EBRT (HFRT) alone or TMZ alone was at least equivalent to conventionally fractionated EBRT (CFRT) alone. We sought to investigate the practice patterns and survival in elderly patients with GBM. We identified patients age 65-90 in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) with histologically confirmed GBM from 1998 to 2012 and known chemotherapy and radiotherapy status. We analyzed factors predicting treatment with EBRT alone vs. EBRT plus concurrent single-agent chemotherapy (CRT) using multivariable logistic regression. Similarly, within the EBRT alone cohort we compared CFRT (54-65 Gy at 1.7-2.1 Gy/fraction) to HFRT (34-60 Gy at 2.5-5 Gy/fraction). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (MVA) with propensity score adjustment was used to compare survival. A total of 38,862 patients were included. Initial treatments for 1998 versus 2012 were: EBRT alone = 50 versus 10%; CRT = 6 versus 50%; chemo alone = 1.6% (70% single-agent) versus 3.2% (94% single-agent). Among EBRT alone patients, use of HFRT (compared to CFRT) increased from 13 to 41%. Numerous factors predictive for utilization of CRT over EBRT alone and for HFRT over CFRT were identified. Median survival and 1-year overall survival were higher in the CRT versus EBRT alone group at 8.6 months vs. 5.1 months and 36.0 versus 15.7% (p < 0.0005 by log-rank, multivariable HR 0.65 [95% CI = 0.61-0.68, p < 0.0005], multivariable HR with propensity adjustment 0.66 [95% CI = 0.63-0.70, p < 0.0005]). For elderly GBM patients in the United States, CRT is the most common initial treatment and appears to offer a survival advantage over EBRT alone.

"""Development of a new theoretical model for blood-CNTs effective thermal conductivity pertaining to hyperthermia therapy of glioblastoma multiform.""","""Background and objective: The present study deals with the hyperthermia therapy, which is the type of treatment in which tissues are exposed to high temperatures in order to destroy cancer cells with minimal injury to healthy tissues. In particular, it focuses on glioblastoma multiform, which is the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain. Conventional treatments display limitations that can be overcome by using nanoparticles for targeted heating. Out of the proposed nanoparticles, this investigation focuses on a new field that utilizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are able to selectively heat the cancer cells since they can convert near infrared light into heat. In the absence of any experiment or theoretical model for the estimation of an effective thermal conductivity of blood and CNTs, a first principle model is developed in this study which takes into account the blood micro-structure. Besides, a number of factors are included, namely the shape and the size of the nanoparticles, the interfacial layer formed around them and their volume fraction. Methods: Firstly, assuming that the blood consists of blood cells and plasma, the thermal conductivity of the former is estimated. Then, the effective thermal conductivity of plasma/CNTs is calculated for various parameters. Finally, the resulting 'bio-nanofluid' consisting of plasma/CNTs and blood cells is formed. Results: It is ascertained that thin and elongated CNTs with relatively large nanolayer thickness as well as large concentrations of CNTs contribute to the increase of the thermal conductivity and, thus, in the enhancement of the heat transfer. Conclusions: Investigating of how design parameters pertaining to CNTs, such as their size and shape, affect the effective thermal conductivity of blood-CNTs, possible regulating ways are suggested regarding the hyperthermic treatment. Finally, the present simple estimation of the effective thermal conductivity can be used as an effective property of the nanofluid when it comes to numerical investigations regarding heat transfer occurring during hyperthermia or other potential clinical uses (for example targeted heat of living tissues).""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30902129
"""The clinical characteristics and outcomes of incidentally discovered glioblastoma.""","""Objective: With an increase in the number of imaging examinations and the development of imaging technology, a small number of glioblastomas (GBMs) are identified by incidental radiological images. These incidentally discovered glioblastomas (iGBMs) are rare, and their clinical features are not well understood. Here, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of iGBM. Methods: Data of newly diagnosed iGBM patients who were treated at our institution between August 2005 and October 2019 were reviewed. An iGBM was defined as a GBM without a focal sign, discovered on radiological images obtained for reasons unrelated to the tumor. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 315 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, four (1.3%) were classified as having iGBM. Health screening was the most common reason for tumor discovery (75.0%). The preoperative Karnofsky performance status score was 100 in three patients. Tumors were found on the right side in three cases. The mean volume of preoperative enhanced tumor lesion was 16.8 cm3. The median duration from confirmation of an enhanced lesion to surgery was 13.5 days. In all cases, either total (100%) or subtotal (95-99%) resections were achieved. The median PFS and OS were 10.5 and 20.0 months, respectively. Conclusions: The iGBMs were often small and in the right non-eloquent area, and the patients had good performance status. We found that timely therapeutic intervention provided iGBM patients with favorable outcomes. This report suggests that early detection of GBM may lead to a better prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985720
"""Assessment of treatment response to dendritic cell vaccine in patients with glioblastoma using a multiparametric MRI-based prediction model.""","""Purpose: Autologous tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax-L) is a promising treatment modality for glioblastomas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential utility of multiparametric MRI-based prediction model in evaluating treatment response in glioblastoma patients treated with DCVax-L. Methods: Seventeen glioblastoma patients treated with standard-of-care therapy + DCVax-L were included. When tumor progression (TP) was suspected and repeat surgery was being contemplated, we sought to ascertain the number of cases correctly classified as TP + mixed response or pseudoprogression (PsP) from multiparametric MRI-based prediction model using histopathology/mRANO criteria as ground truth. Multiparametric MRI model consisted of predictive probabilities (PP) of tumor progression computed from diffusion and perfusion MRI-derived parameters. A comparison of overall survival (OS) was performed between patients treated with standard-of-care therapy + DCVax-L and standard-of-care therapy alone (external controls). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to compare OS between two groups of patients using PsP, Ki-67, and MGMT promoter methylation status as stratification variables. Results: Multiparametric MRI model correctly predicted TP + mixed response in 72.7% of cases (8/11) and PsP in 83.3% (5/6) with an overall concordance rate of 76.5% with final diagnosis as determined by histopathology/mRANO criteria. There was a significant concordant correlation coefficient between PP values and histopathology/mRANO criteria (r = 0.54; p = 0.026). DCVax-L-treated patients had significantly prolonged OS than those treated with standard-of-care therapy (22.38 ± 12.8 vs. 13.8 ± 9.5 months, p = 0.040). Additionally, glioblastomas with PsP, MGMT promoter methylation status, and Ki-67 values below median had longer OS than their counterparts.

"""Therapeutic targeting of malignant glioma.""","""Glioblastoma Multiforme (GMB) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with poor survival rates and universal recurrence despite aggressive treatments. Recent research suggested that GBM has multiple glioma cell populations, some of which are organized in a stem cell hierarchical order with different stages of differention. Evidence indicated that recurrence is due to a development or persistance of a subpopulation of these tumor cells which are inherently resistant to treatment and these were defined as the glioma stem-like cells (GSC). It is hypothesized that GSC become highly malignant by accumulating mutations in oncogenic pathways. These cells present with specific surface markers which helps identify them. Targeting the surface markers as well as the signaling pathways of GSCs has been an ongoing research effort. This review focuses on summarizing the current treatment modalities used to glioblastoma treatments, evaluating their efficacy in controlling and eradicatig the GSCs, discussing the machanisms involved in GSC tumor proliferation and resistance to treatments in addition to proposing potential avenues to target GSCs in order to provide a potential cure for this cancer.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25175690

Thus, glioblastoma-associated microglia and macrophages are logical therapeutic targets. Their emerging roles in glioblastoma progression are reflected in the burgeoning research into therapeutics directed at their modification or elimination. Here, we review the biology of glioblastoma-associated microglia and macrophages, and model systems used to study these cells in vitro and in vivo. We discuss translation of results using these model systems and review recent advances in immunotherapies targeting microglia and macrophages in glioblastoma.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) provides timely information about the genetic landscape of tumours and might detect targetable mutations. To date, differences exist in the application and NGS assays used as it remains unclear to what extent these variants may affect clinical decision making. In this survey-based study, we investigated the use of NGS in adult patients with glioblastoma in Switzerland. Methods: All eight primary care centres for Neuro-Oncology in Switzerland participated in this survey. The NGS assays used as well as the criteria for the application of NGS in newly diagnosed glioblastoma were investigated. Decision trees were analysed for consensus and discrepancies using the objective consensus methodology. Results: Seven out of eight centres perform NGS in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma using custom made or commercially available assays. The criteria most relevant to decision making were age, suitability of standard treatment and fitness. NGS is most often used in fitter patients under the age of 60 years who are not suitable for standard therapy, while it is rarely performed in patients in poor general health.

"""Immune landscape-based machine-learning-assisted subclassification, prognosis, and immunotherapy prediction for glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: As a malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by intratumor heterogeneity, a worse prognosis, and highly invasive, lethal, and refractory natures. Immunotherapy has been becoming a promising strategy to treat diverse cancers. It has been known that there are highly heterogeneous immunosuppressive microenvironments among different GBM molecular subtypes that mainly include classical (CL), mesenchymal (MES), and proneural (PN), respectively. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of immune landscapes among them is essential for identifying novel immune markers of GBM. Methods and results: In the present study, based on collecting the largest number of 109 immune signatures, we aim to achieve a precise diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy prediction for GBM by performing a comprehensive immunogenomic analysis. Firstly, machine-learning (ML) methods were proposed to evaluate the diagnostic values of these immune signatures, and the optimal classifier was constructed for accurate recognition of three GBM subtypes with robust and promising performance. The prognostic values of these signatures were then confirmed, and a risk score was established to divide all GBM patients into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups with a high predictive accuracy for overall survival (OS). Therefore, complete differential analysis across GBM subtypes was performed in terms of the immune characteristics along with clinicopathological and molecular features, which indicates that MES shows much higher immune heterogeneity compared to CL and PN but has significantly better immunotherapy responses, although MES patients may have an immunosuppressive microenvironment and be more proinflammatory and invasive. Finally, the MES subtype is proved to be more sensitive to 17-AAG, docetaxel, and erlotinib using drug sensitivity analysis and three compounds of AS-703026, PD-0325901, and MEK1-2-inhibitor might be potential therapeutic agents.

"""Tumor treating fields with radiation for glioblastoma: a narrative review.""","""Background and objective: With a phase 3 clinical trial (EF-32, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471844) currently underway examining the potential benefit of concurrent chemoradiation and tumor treating fields (TTFields) for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), we present the following narrative review to highlight the current evidence that supports this approach. The current management paradigm for GBM includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiation with further temozolomide (TMZ) and TTFields used as maintenance therapy. Despite several treatment advances over the past few decades, the overall prognosis remains poor and new strategies are currently under investigation, including the use of chemoradiation concurrently with TTFields. Methods: In this review, we will discuss the preclinical and clinical work that has been performed combining both TTFields with radiation. We performed a narrative review of peer-reviewed articles related to the management of glioblastoma with regard to concurrent chemoradiation and TTFields and synthesized the data in the context of our clinical experience and practice. PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and various center-specific guidelines were searched for literature regarding concurrent chemoradiation with TTFields for patients with GBM. Key content and findings: Driven by preclinical studies demonstrating the synergy between TTFields and radiation, more recent clinical work has been performed and has shown that combining treatment is both feasible and tolerable. Conclusions: In this review, we will discuss the mechanism of action which TTFields and radiation share, as well as discuss the toxicities of combining therapy in patients with GBM. Based on institutional experiences, we will highlight treatment techniques, including scalp sparing methodology and modified computed tomography (CT) simulation workflow, when concurrent TTFields and radiation are given. Lastly, we will provide discuss management considerations, specifically scalp prophylactic interventions and treatments, when using concurrent TTFields with chemoradiation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36336899
"""Tumor Treating Fields in the Management of Patients with Malignant Gliomas.""","""Malignant gliomas remain a challenging cancer to treat due to limitations in both therapeutic and efficacious options. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) have emerged as a novel, locoregional, antineoplastic treatment modality with favorable efficacy and safety being demonstrated in the most aggressive type of malignant gliomas, glioblastoma (GBM). In 2 large randomized, controlled phase 3 trials, the addition of TTFields was associated with increased overall survival when combined with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) and comparable overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). TTFields target cancer cells by several mechanisms of action (MoA) including suppression of proliferation, migration and invasion, disruption of DNA repair and angiogenesis, antimitotic effects, and induction of apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Having several MoAs makes TTFields an attractive modality to combine with standard, salvage, and novel treatment regimens (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy). Treatment within the field of malignant gliomas is evolving to emphasize combinatorial approaches that work synergistically to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review the current use of TTFields in GBM, discuss MOA and treatment delivery, and consider the potential for its wider adoption in other gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734509

"""Targeted delivery of miRNA based therapeuticals in the clinical management of Glioblastoma Multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive (WHO grade IV) form of diffuse glioma endowed with tremendous invasive capacity. The availability of narrow therapeutic choices for GBM management adds to the irony, even the post-treatment median survival time is roughly around 14-16 months. Gene mutations seem to be cardinal to GBM formation, owing to involvement of amplified and mutated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-encoding genes, leading to dysregulation of growth factor signaling pathways. Of-late, the role of different microRNAs (miRNAs) in progression and proliferation of GBM was realized, which lead to their burgeon potential applications for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. miRNA signatures are intricately linked with onset and progression of GBM. Although, progression of GBM causes significant changes in the BBB to form BBTB, but still efficient passage of cancer therapeutics, including antibodies and miRNAs are prevented, leading to low bioavailability. Recent developments in the nanomedicine field provide novel approaches to manage GBM via efficient and brain targeted delivery of miRNAs either alone or as part of cytotoxic pharmaceutical composition, thereby modulating cell signaling in well predicted manner to promise positive therapeutic outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32302695

"""Response of U87 glioma xenografts treated with concurrent rapamycin and fractionated radiotherapy: possible role for thrombosis.""","""Background and purpose: Rapamycin, a highly specific mTOR inhibitor, has shown anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties, as well as an enhancement in tumour growth delay when used in combination with radiation in mouse xenograft models. Our goal was to determine if rapamycin can also have a positive effect on the local tumour control achieved by radiotherapy. Materials and methods: Nude mice bearing U87 glioblastoma xenografts were treated with concomitant rapamycin and radiotherapy over a 5 day fractionation schedule. Animals received graded total doses ranging from 24 to 100 Gy. Experimental endpoints were tumour growth delay and local tumour control. In addition, histological evaluation of tumour sections was performed to examine changes occurring within the tumour microenvironment as a result of treatment. Analysis of proliferation, mTOR signalling, hypoxia, and vessel thrombosis was conducted. Results: As a single agent, rapamycin reduced the in vitro growth of U87 cells by 70% and caused a 4 day growth delay of tumour xenografts. In combination with radiation, no further increase in tumour growth delay was observed when compared to radiation alone. The tumour control dose 50% (TCD(50)) was 46.8 Gy (95% CI 41; 53 Gy) in tumours treated with radiation alone and was slightly but not significantly lower at 42.8 Gy (95% CI 36; 49 Gy) after simultaneous treatment with rapamycin. Histological evaluation revealed evidence of elevated hypoxia following rapamycin treatment that may be due to vessel thrombosis. Conclusions: The influence of rapamycin on thrombosis and tumour hypoxia may be a confounding factor limiting its effectiveness in combination with radiotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17161482
"""The impact of repeated surgery and adjuvant therapy on survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.""","""Objective: Treatment of glioblastoma recurrence can have a palliative aim, after considering risks and potential benefits. The aim of this study is to verify the impact of surgery and of palliative adjuvant treatments on survival after recurrence. Methods: From January 2002 to June 2008, we treated 76 consecutive patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Treatment was: 1-surgery alone--17 patients; 2-adjuvant-therapy alone--24 patients; 3-surgery and adjuvant therapy--16 patients; no treatment--19 patients. The impact on median overall-survival (OS-time between recurrence and death/last follow-up) of age, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), resection extent and adjuvant treatment scheme (Temozolomide alone vs low-dose fractionated radiotherapy vs others) was determined. Survival curves were obtained through the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional-hazards was used for multivariate analyses. Significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Median OS was 7 months. At univariate analysis, patients with a KPS≥70 had a longer OS (9 months vs 5 months--p<0.0001). OS was 6 months for patients treated with surgery alone, 5 months for patients that received no treatment, 8 months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone, 14 months for patients treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy--p=0.01. Patients with a KPS<70 were significantly at risk for death - HR 2.8 - p=0.001. Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between patients receiving gross total or partial tumor resection and among patients receiving different adjuvant therapy schemes. Major surgical morbidity at tumor recurrence occurred in 16 out of 33 patients (48%).

"""An Overview of Alternating Electric Fields Therapy (NovoTTF Therapy) for the Treatment of Malignant Glioma.""","""As with many cancer treatments, tumor treating fields (TTFields) target rapidly dividing tumor cells. During mitosis, TTFields-exposed cells exhibit uncontrolled membrane blebbing at the onset of anaphase, resulting in aberrant mitotic exit. Based on these criteria, at least two protein complexes have been proposed as TTFields' molecular targets, including α/β-tubulin and the septin 2, 6, 7 heterotrimer. After aberrant mitotic exit, cells exhibited abnormal nuclei and signs of cellular stress, including decreased cellular proliferation and p53 dependence, and exhibit the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, suggesting that TTFields treatment may induce an antitumor immune response. Clinical trials lead to Food and Drug Administration approval for their treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Detailed modeling of TTFields within the brain suggests that the location of the tumor may affect treatment efficacy.

"""Distinct Phenotypic Clusters of Glioblastoma Growth and Response Kinetics Predict Survival.""","""Purpose: Despite the intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity seen in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), there is little definitive data on the underlying cause of the differences in patient survivals. Serial imaging assessment of tumor growth allows quantification of tumor growth kinetics (TGK) measured in terms of changes in the velocity of radial expansion seen on imaging. Because a systematic study of this entire TGK phenotype-growth before treatment and during each treatment to recurrence -has never been coordinately studied in GBMs, we sought to identify whether patients cluster into discrete groups on the basis of their TGK. Patients and methods: From our multi-institutional database, we identified 48 patients who underwent maximally safe resection followed by radiotherapy with imaging follow-up through the time of recurrence. The patients were then clustered into two groups through a k-means algorithm taking as input only the TGK before and during treatment. Results: There was a significant survival difference between the clusters ( P = .003). Paradoxically, patients among the long-lived cluster had significantly larger tumors at diagnosis ( P = .027) and faster growth before treatment ( P = .003) but demonstrated a better response to adjuvant chemotherapy ( P = .048). A predictive model was built to identify which cluster patients would likely fall into on the basis of information that would be available to clinicians immediately after radiotherapy (accuracy, 90.3%). Conclusion: Dichotomizing the heterogeneity of GBMs into two populations-one faster growing yet more responsive with increased survival and one slower growing yet less responsive with shorter survival-suggests that many patients who receive standard-of-care treatments may get better benefit from select alternative treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30652553
"""Presentation, management, and outcome of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in elderly patients.""","""Object: Optimum management for elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) in the temozolomide (TMZ) era is not well defined. The object of this study was to clarify outcomes in this population. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 105 consecutive cases involving elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with newly diagnosed GBM who were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 2003 and 2008. Results: The patients' median age was 74 years (range 66-87 years), and the median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was 80 (range 40-90). Half of the patients underwent biopsy and half underwent resection. Patients with deep-seated lesions (19 patients [18%]) or multifocal lesions (34 patients [32%]) were more likely to have biopsy than resection (p = 0.0001 and 0.0009, respectively). New persistent neurological deficits developed in 7 patients (6.7%). Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 6 patients (5.7%), all of whom underwent biopsy. Complete follow-up data regarding adjuvant treatment was available in 84 patients. Forty-one (49%) were treated with chemotherapy (mostly TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT), and 23 (27%) with RT alone. Nineteen (23%) received only palliative care after surgery (more common with biopsy, p = 0.03). Chemotherapy complications occurred in 28.6% (Grade 3 or 4 hematological complications in 11.9%). The median values for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.5 and 5.5 months. In a multivariate analysis, younger age (p = 0.03, risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89), single lesion (p = 0.02, RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.89), resection (p = 0.04, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.94), and adjuvant treatment (p = 0.0001, RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.49) were associated with better OS. Only adjuvant treatment was significantly associated with prolonged PFS (p = 0.0007, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.57). With combined therapy with resection, RT, and chemotherapy, the median PFS and OS were 8 and 12.5 months, respectively. Conclusions: The prognosis for GBM worsens with increasing age in elderly patients. With important risks, resection and adjuvant treatment are associated with prolonged survival. Although selection bias cannot be excluded in this retrospective study, advanced age alone should not necessarily preclude optimal resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23176331

We investigated the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) added to conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with carmustine (BCNU) on the survival of patients with GBM. Methods and materials: A total of 203 patients with supratentorial GBM (tumor < or =40 mm) were randomly assigned either to postoperative SRS followed by EBRT (60 Gy) plus BCNU (80 mg/m(2) Days 1-3 every 8 weeks for six cycles) or to EBRT with BCNU alone. The dose of radiosurgery was tumor size-dependent and ranged from 15 Gy for largest to 24 Gy for smallest tumors. RT and BCNU were identical in both arms. Results: At a median follow-up time of 61 months, the median survival in the radiosurgery group was 13.5 months (95% confidence interval, 11.0-14.8) as compared with 13.6 months (95% confidence interval, 11.2-15.2, p = 0.5711) for the standard treatment group. There were also no significant differences in 2- and 3-year survival rates and in patterns of failure between the two arms. Quality of life deterioration and cognitive decline at the end of therapy, compared with baseline, were comparable and there was no difference in quality-adjusted survival between the arms. Conclusions: Stereotactic radiosurgery followed by EBRT and BCNU does not improve the outcome in patients with GBM nor does it change the general quality of life or cognitive functioning.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15465203

In this way, vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) could help tumor eradication by destroying its neovessels. In this study, we designed a polysiloxane-based nanoparticle (NP) combining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, a photosensitizer (PS) and a new ligand peptide motif (KDKPPR) targeting neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a receptor overexpressed by angiogenic endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature. This structure achieves the detection of the tumor tissue and its proliferating part by MRI analysis, followed by its treatment by VTP. The photophysical properties of the PS and the peptide affinity for NRP-1 recombinant protein were preserved after the functionalization of NPs. Cellular uptake of NPs by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was increased twice compared to NPs without the KDKPPR peptide moiety or conjugated with a scramble peptide. NPs induced no cytotoxicity without light exposure but conferred a photocytotoxic effect to cells after photodynamic therapy (PDT). The in vivo selectivity, evaluated using a skinfold chamber model in mice, confirms that the functionalized NPs with KDKPPR peptide moiety were localized in the tumor vessel wall.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29026302

Improvements in both therapeutic and follow-up strategies are urgently needed. In previous work we described an oscillatory pattern of response to Temozolomide (TMZ) using a standard administration protocol, detected through MRSI-based machine learning approaches. In the present work, we have introduced the Immune-Enhancing Metronomic Schedule (IMS) with an every 6-d TMZ administration at 60 mg/kg and investigated the consistence of such oscillatory behaviour. A total of n = 17 GL261 GB tumour-bearing C57BL/6j mice were studied with MRI/MRSI every 2 d, and the oscillatory behaviour (6.2 ± 1.5 d period from the TMZ administration day) was confirmed during response. Furthermore, IMS-TMZ produced significant improvement in mice survival (22.5 ± 3.0 d for controls vs 135.8 ± 78.2 for TMZ-treated), outperforming standard TMZ treatment. Histopathological correlation was investigated in selected tumour samples (n = 6) analyzing control and responding fields. Significant differences were found for CD3+ cells (lymphocytes, 3.3 ± 2.5 vs 4.8 ± 2.9, respectively) and Iba-1 immunostained area (microglia/macrophages, 16.8% ± 9.7% and 21.9% ± 11.4%, respectively). Unexpectedly, during IMS-TMZ treatment, tumours from some mice (n = 6) fully regressed and remained undetectable without further treatment for 1 mo. These animals were considered 'cured' and a GL261 re-challenge experiment performed, with no tumour reappearance in five out of six cases. Heterogeneous therapy response outcomes were detected in tumour-bearing mice, and a selected group was investigated (n = 3 non-responders, n = 6 relapsing tumours, n = 3 controls). PD-L1 content was found ca. 3-fold increased in the relapsing group when comparing with control and non-responding groups, suggesting that increased lymphocyte inhibition could be associated to IMS-TMZ failure. Overall, data suggest that host immune response has a relevant role in therapy response/escape in GL261 tumours under IMS-TMZ therapy. This is associated to changes in the metabolomics pattern, oscillating every 6 d, in agreement with immune cycle length, which is being sampled by MRSI-derived nosological images.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31926117

Nineteen glioblastomas and one anaplastic glioma (12 males and 8 females: age: 20-69 years, median: 50) were implanted between January 1993 and December 1994. Previous treatments included surgery (18/20). 55-60 Gy external beam radiotherapy (20/20), and chemotherapy (16/20); interval between initial treatment and retreatment with iridium 192 was 6 to 39 months (median: 10). Maximum diameter of the tumour at the moment of implantation was 2.1-10.1 cm (median: 6.4 cm) and tumour volume 2.122 cm3 (median: 22 cm3). All tumours were supra-tentorial (right hemisphere: 9; left hemisphere: 11). Karnofsky index was 60-100 (median: 80). Implantation was carried out under local anaesthesia; tumour contours were visualised using either a CT-scan (16/20) or a MRI (4/20). Dosimetry was carried out using two orthogonal films and CT-scan images. Total dose on the reference isodose was 40-60 Gy (60 Gy: 9; 50 Gy: 7; 40 Gy: 4); dose-rate was 0.24-0.73 Gy/h (median: 0.38).

"""Biomimetic GBM-targeted drug delivery system boosting ferroptosis for immunotherapy of orthotopic drug-resistant GBM.""","""Background: Clinical studies have shown that the efficacy of programmed cell death receptor-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors on glioblastoma (GBM) is much lower than what is expected because of the low immunogenicity of GBM. Ferroptosis of cancer cells can induce the maturation of dendritic cells (DC cells) and increase the activity of T cell. The activated T cells release IFN-γ, which subsequently induces the ferroptosis of cancer cells. Thus, the aim of this paper is to set up a new GBM-targeted drug delivery system (Fe3O4-siPD-L1@M-BV2) to boost ferroptosis for immunotherapy of drug-resistant GBM. Results: Fe3O4-siPD-L1@M-BV2 significantly increased the accumulation of siPD-L1 and Fe2+ in orthotopic drug-resistant GBM tissue in mice. Fe3O4-siPD-L1@M-BV2 markedly decreased the protein expression of PD-L1 and increased the ratio between effector T cells and regulatory T cells in orthotopic drug-resistant GBM tissue. Moreover, Fe3O4-siPD-L1@M-BV2 induced ferroptosis of GBM cells and maturation of DC cell, and it also increased the ratio between M1-type microglia and M2-type microglia in orthotopic drug-resistant GBM tissue. Finally, the growth of orthotopic drug-resistant GBM in mice was significantly inhibited by Fe3O4-siPD-L1@M-BV2.

"""Metformin repositioning as antitumoral agent: selective antiproliferative effects in human glioblastoma stem cells, via inhibition of CLIC1-mediated ion current.""","""Epidemiological and preclinical studies propose that metformin, a first-line drug for type-2 diabetes, exerts direct antitumor activity. Although several clinical trials are ongoing, the molecular mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here we show that chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1) is a direct target of metformin in human glioblastoma cells. Metformin exposure induces antiproliferative effects in cancer stem cell-enriched cultures, isolated from three individual WHO grade IV human glioblastomas. These effects phenocopy metformin-mediated inhibition of a chloride current specifically dependent on CLIC1 functional activity. CLIC1 ion channel is preferentially active during the G1-S transition via transient membrane insertion. Metformin inhibition of CLIC1 activity induces G1 arrest of glioblastoma stem cells. This effect was time-dependent, and prolonged treatments caused antiproliferative effects also for low, clinically significant, metformin concentrations. Furthermore, substitution of Arg29 in the putative CLIC1 pore region impairs metformin modulation of channel activity. The lack of drugs affecting cancer stem cell viability is the main cause of therapy failure and tumor relapse.

To optimise the synergy of the combined therapies, factors such as radiation dose and fractionation must be considered, alongside numerous parameters resulting from the complexity of cancer-immune system interactions. It is instructive to use mathematical models to tackle this problem. Methods: In this work, we adapted a model primarily to describe the synergistic effect between single-fraction radiotherapy and immunotherapy (1-methyl tryptophan) observed in previous experiments with glioblastoma-carrying rats. We also showed how the model can be used to generate hypotheses on the outcome of other treatment fractionation schemes. Results: The model successfully reproduced the results of the experiments. Moreover, it provided support for the hypothesis that, for a given biologically effective dose, the efficacy of the combination therapy and the synergy between the two therapies are favoured by the administration of radiotherapy in a hypofractionated regime. Furthermore, for a double-fraction irradiation regimen, the synergy is favoured by a short time interval between the treatment fractions. Conclusion: It was concluded that the model could be fitted to reproduce the experimental data well within its uncertainties. It was also demonstrated that the fitted model can be used to form hypotheses to be validated by further pre-clinical experiments. Advances in knowledge: The results of this work support the hypothesis that the synergetic action of combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy is favoured by using a hypofractionated radiation treatment regimen, given over a short time interval.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688039
"""Toxicity and Efficacy of a Novel GADD34-expressing Oncolytic HSV-1 for the Treatment of Experimental Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system cancer in adults. Oncolytic HSV-1 (oHSV) is the first FDA-approved gene therapy approach for the treatment of malignant melanoma. For GBM, oHSVs need to be engineered to replicate within and be toxic to the glial tumor but not to normal brain parenchymal cells. We have thus engineered a novel oHSV to achieve these objectives.Experimental Design: NG34 is an attenuated HSV-1 with deletions in the genes encoding viral ICP6 and ICP34.5. These mutations suppress virus replication in nondividing brain neurons. NG34 expresses the human GADD34 gene under transcriptional control of a cellular Nestin gene promoter/enhancer element, whose expression occurs selectively in GBM. In vitro cytotoxicity assay and survival studies with mouse models were performed to evaluate therapeutic potency of NG34 against glioblastoma. In vivo neurotoxicity evaluation of NG34 was tested by intracerebral inoculation.Results: NG34 replicates in GBM cells in vitro with similar kinetics as those exhibited by an oHSV that is currently in clinical trials (rQNestin34.5). Dose-response cytotoxicity of NG34 in human GBM panels was equivalent to or improved compared with rQNestin34.5. The in vivo efficacy of NG34 against two human orthotopic GBM models in athymic mice was similar to that of rQNestin34.5, whereas intracerebral injection of NG34 in the brains of immunocompetent and athymic mice showed significantly better tolerability. NG34 was also effective in a syngeneic mouse glioblastoma model.Conclusions: A novel oHSV encoding GADD34 is efficacious and relatively nontoxic in mouse models of GBM.

"""Efficacy of clinical prognostic factors on survival in patients with glioblastoma.""","""Aim: Glioblastoma is the most common and highest-grade infiltrative astrocytoma. It is usually associated with a bad prognosis. Histological grading is highly predictive of an aggressive behavior, with a mean survival rate of 1 year. Nonetheless, individual patient survival can vary substantially, ranging from 1 month to over 5 years. Several distinct clinical parameters and molecular alterations have recently been described in glioblastoma. The present study compares clinical, radiologic and therapeutic parameters in a series of glioblastomas to identify prognostic factors. Material and methods: We evaluated 50 cases who were operated on for intracranial glioblastoma between January 1998-March 2004 retrospectively. All clinical records, radiological records and management modalities were evaluated as prognostic value. Results: The mean survival time was 7.5 months (range, 1-18 months). We confirmed the patients' age, gender, Karnofsky Performance Scale score at discharge, postoperative radiotherapy and reoperation as decisive prognostic factors after multivariate analyses. Conclusion: We could show that some clinical parameters and treatment modalities were associated with prognosis. Younger age, male gender, higher Karnofsky Performance Score at discharge, total surgical resection, radiotherapy and reoperation were predictor for better prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20401838
"""Enhanced antitumor effects of radiotherapy combined local nimustine delivery rendezvousing with oral temozolomide chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients.""","""Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the worst cancers with bad prognosis despite systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery. Methods: In this study, 71 patients with GBM were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: Receiving radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) (TMZ, standard therapy) after surgery, or receiving radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant local delivery of nimustine (ACNU) rendezvousing with oral TMZ (rendezvous therapy). In the follow-up of all patients and the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and toxicities were recorded. Results: For the whole cohort, the median OS was 18.0 months, and the median PFS was 7.8 months. A significantly longer OS was observed in patients received rendezvous therapy than those who receiving standard therapy (18.5 months vs. 16.0 months; P = 0.014), as well as PFS (8.8 months vs. 7.0 months; P = 0.008). The KPS ≥70 rates were 81.8%, 40.9%, 20.5% in 1, 2, and 3 years for the rendezvous therapy group, significantly superior to standard therapy group. The most common toxicities were tolerable gastrointestinal reaction, liver dysfunction, and hematological toxicities, which were relieved with symptomatic treatment. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was documented in 8 (18.3%) patients in rendezvous therapy group, while it was observed in 6 (22.2%) patients in standard therapy group during whole treatment process. Conclusions: Compared to standard therapy, the antitumor effects of rendezvous therapy were more effective in GBM patients without increasing the toxicities.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29516964

Mutations in the metabolic enzyme glioblastomas (IDH1) represent a distinguishing feature of low-grade gliomas and secondary GBMs. IDH1 mutations are one of the most common and earliest detectable genetic alterations in low-grade diffuse gliomas, and evidence supports this mutation as a driver of gliomagenesis. Here, the authors highlight the biological consequences of IDH1 mutations in gliomas, the clinical and therapeutic/diagnostic implications, and the molecular subtypes of these tumors. They also explore, in brief, the non-IDH1-mutated gliomas, including primary GBMs, and the molecular subtypes and drivers of these tumors.

"""NKG2D-Based CAR T Cells and Radiotherapy Exert Synergistic Efficacy in Glioblastoma.""","""Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an emerging immunotherapy against several malignancies including glioblastoma, the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults. The challenges in solid tumor immunotherapy comprise heterogenously expressed tumor target antigens and restricted trafficking of CAR T cells to and impaired long-term persistence at the tumor site, as well as the unaddressed integration of CAR T-cell therapy into conventional anticancer treatments. We addressed these questions using a NKG2D-based chimeric antigen receptor construct (chNKG2D) in fully immunocompetent orthotopic glioblastoma mouse models. ChNKG2D T cells demonstrated high IFNγ production and cytolytic activity in vitro Upon systemic administration in vivo, chNKG2D T cells migrated to the tumor site in the brain, did not induce adverse events, prolonged survival, and cured a fraction of glioma-bearing mice. Surviving mice were protected long-term against tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, this was not solely the result of a classical immune memory response, but rather involved local persistence of chNKG2D T cells. A subtherapeutic dose of local radiotherapy in combination with chNKG2D T-cell treatment resulted in synergistic activity in two independent syngeneic mouse glioma models by promoting migration of CAR T cells to the tumor site and increased effector functions. We thus provide preclinical proof-of-concept of NKG2D CAR T-cell activity in mouse glioma models and demonstrate efficacy, long-term persistence, and synergistic activity in combination with radiotherapy, providing a rationale to translate this immunotherapeutic strategy to human glioma patients.Significance: These findings provide evidence for synergy of conventional anticancer therapy and CAR T cells and heralds future studies for other treatment combinations.

"""Gap junctions in human glioblastomas: implications for suicide gene therapy.""","""Glioblastoma is a very aggressive astrocytic tumor and most patients have 1-year survival time after diagnosis. A promising therapeutic strategy is the local delivery of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene in the tumor bed followed by ganciclovir treatment. The presence of functional gap junctions is highly relevant for the success of suicide gene therapy. Connexins are expressed in practically all tissues and form gap junctions that allow intercellular communication. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the major connexin member being expressed in astrocytes but its status in glioblastoma is not well defined. We have investigated by immunofluorescence the presence of Cx43 in 74 human glioblastoma samples; its expression was detected in 77% of the samples analyzed. We report here that glioblastoma is a heterogenous disease as regards Cx43 expression with presentations, in which Cx43 expression is unaltered, reduced or totally lost. A predominant Cx43 cytoplasmic localization was observed in four out of eight primary glioblastoma cultures that we have established. This aberrant localization reduced gap junctionnal intercellular communication by 50 to 75% as compared with primary cell cultures displaying gap junctional plaques. However, the bystander effect evaluated after lentiviral delivery of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and ganciclovir treatment was detected in all Cx43-positive primary cell cultures, and it was independant of the Cx43 localization. These findings may have important clinical implications for the design of anticancer cytotoxic therapies that rely on the gap junction-mediated bystander effect for their success.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21779029
"""Glioma Surgery: Technological Advances to Achieve a Maximal Safe Resection.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor. Despite the best treatment and advances in therapy, prognosis remains poor. One of the mainstays of therapy in GBM is surgical excision. Several studies have confirmed that the extent of resection (EOR) positively influences overall survival (OS) in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGGs). A literature search was performed using PubMed to assess the useful neurosurgical tools to achieve the best neurosurgical performance. In order to achieve the major extent of resection, preserving neurological function, many tools are now available, especially neuronavigation, intraoperative fluorescence, intraoperative ultrasound, and neuromonitoring. In addition to the maximal excision of tumor, the neurosurgeon can use photodynamic therapy (PTD) and local drug delivery (LDD) to improve the local control and bridge conventional radio and chemotherapy. EOR improves OS in patients with HGGs. There are technological possibilities for achieving a complete resection preserving neurological function, and it is not acceptable to perform only biopsy of these lesions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680413
"""Surgical resection and radiation therapy versus biopsy and radiation therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""There has been considerable controversy over the concept of treating glioblastoma multiforme with cytoreductive surgery. Therefore, a retrospective study of cases treated between 1986 and 1991 was conducted to analyze and compare the results of stereotactic biopsy followed by radiation therapy performed in 58 patients with those of surgical resection plus radiation therapy in 57 patients. In both groups, conventionally fractionated radiation (1.7 to 2.0 Gy/day) was delivered, with a total dose of 50 to 60 Gy. Biopsy was performed only in patients with tumors judged to be inoperable. These patients carried a higher surgical risk and were in worse neurological condition than the patients in the resection group. The median survival time for the resection group was 39.5 weeks, as compared with 32 weeks for the biopsy group. This difference was not significant. The most important prognostic factor was the patient's age. The treatment variable biopsy versus resection did not reach prognostic relevance. In patients with midline shift who underwent biopsy, the Karnofsky Performance Scale score decreased in more patients during radiation therapy. The clinical status 6 weeks after surgery, however, showed no significant differences between the two groups. The comparable survival times for the two groups place doubt on the concept of treating glioblastoma multiforme with cytoreductive surgery. Presently, radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for patients with glioblastoma. There is no question that decompressive surgery followed by radiation therapy should be performed whenever necessary for sever space-occupying lesions and when it will not cause new neurological deficits.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8385709
"""Visualization of angiographical arteriovenous shunting in perisylvian glioblastomas.""","""Background: Arteriovenous shunting visualized by angiography is one of the major features of glioblastomas, and the visualization is dependent on the presence of extensive shunting. Extensive arteriovenous shunting is associated with the risk of poorly controlled intraoperative bleeding. When a tumor with extensive arteriovenous shunting is located in close proximity to the eloquent regions of the brain, a meticulous surgical procedure is necessary. In the present study, the site-oriented visualization of angiographical arteriovenous shunting was evaluated from the perspective of surgical treatment, with a particular focus on the perisylvian region that is in close proximity to motor and language regions (dominant hemisphere), as well as large arteries and veins. Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients underwent a resection of glioblastoma between February 2007 and September 2012. All patients were presurgically examined using digital subtraction angiography. The patients were subdivided into the following two groups based on the location of the tumor: 1) perisylvian glioblastoma (18 patients) and 2) non-perisylvian glioblastoma (eight patients). Angiography to detect the arteriovenous shunting was performed. In addition, the number of intratumoral vessels, tumor proliferative activity (MIB-1 labeling index), and volume of intraoperative bleeding were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Results: Angiographical arteriovenous shunting was definitively visualized in 13 of 18 (72 %) perisylvian glioblastomas, in contrast to only one of eight (13 %) non-perisylvian glioblastomas (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the number of intratumoral vessels, MIB-1 labeling index, and volume of intraoperative bleeding. However, massive intraoperative bleeding of > 2,000 mL occurred in one perisylvian glioblastoma patient. Conclusions: Glioblastomas in the perisylvian region tend to be associated with extensive arteriovenous shunting that can be definitively visualized by performing an angiography. Because arteriovenous shunting carries the risk of intraoperative bleeding, perisylvian glioblastomas-particularly in the dominant hemisphere-should be resected with a meticulous surgical procedure and strategy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23435867

Logistics related to coordinating clinic visits, radiation planning, and surgical recovery necessitate delay in radiation delivery from the time of diagnosis. Unimpeded tumor growth occurs during this period, and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Here we provide a pilot experience of GammaTile ® (GT), a collagen tile-embedded Cesium-131 (131Cs) brachytherapy platform for such aggressive tumors. Methods: We prospectively followed seven consecutive patients (2019-2023) with newly diagnosed (n = 3) or recurrent (n = 4) isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma that grew > 100% in volume during the 30 days between the time of initial diagnosis/surgery and the radiation planning MRI. These patients underwent re-resection followed by GT placement. Results: There were no surgical complications. One patient developed right hemiparesis prior to re-resection/GT placement and was discharged to rehabilitation, all others were discharged home-with a median hospital stay of 2 days (range: 1-5 days). There was no 30-day mortality and one 30-day readmission (hydrocephalus, requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting (14%)). With a median follow-up of 347 days (11.6 months), median progression free survival of ≥ 320 days (10.6 months) was achieved for both newly and recurrent glioblastoma patients. The median overall survival (mOS) was 304 and 347 days (10 and 11.5 mo) for recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients, respectively.

"""Oncolytic viruses as a promising therapeutic strategy against the detrimental health impacts of air pollution: The case of glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and those who work in the field of (bio)energy.

Here, the cooperative effects of sodium phenylacetate (NaPa) and/or tamoxifen (TAM) on CNS1 and 9L glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in an experimental animal tumor model were investigated. Materials and methods: The drug effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. CNS1 cells were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice to form tumors which were then treated with NaPa, TAM or NaPa/TAM. Results: A significant inhibitory effect of NaPa on the two glioma cell lines (LD50 of 10 mM) was observed. 10(-5) M of TAM inhibited approximately 35% of 9L cell growth, and 90% of CNS1 cell growth. When a combination of both drugs included 10(-9) M of TAM, inhibition of about 50% of 9L cell growth and 75% of CNS1 cell growth occurred. The NaPa/TAM combined treatment increased the number of G0/G1 arrested cells and apoptotic cells as compared to treatments with NaPa or TAM alone. Inhibition of CNS1 tumor growth were observed after a two week treatment with NaPa (32 mg/kg/day) or TAM (6 mg/kg/day).

"""Radiation therapy treatment planning in supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme: an analysis based on post mortem topographic anatomy with CT correlations.""","""In a previous study of the brains of 15 adults with glioblastoma multiforme who received minimal or no radiotherapy we determined the topographic distribution of tumor cells. All 15 brains had been fixed and then cut in the coronal or horizontal plane. The distribution of neoplastic cells was determined and entered onto tracings of the whole mount histologic sections. The last CT scans obtained prior to death of 11 of the patients were reviewed independently by a neuroradiologist who traced, on the CT scans, the outer edge of both the contrast-enhancing area and the peritumoral low density 'edema'. Presented with the neuroradiologist's assessment of the contrast enhancing rim of tumor and of the 'edema', a radiotherapist and a radiation dosimetrist, in the present study, prepared treatment plans for a 6 MeV linear accelerator. In 9 of the 11 cases in which immediately antemortum CT scans were available, radiation treatment of the contrast enhancing area alone with a 1 cm margin would have missed portions of the histologically identified tumor. Treatment of the contrast enhancing area along with the peritumoral 'edema', with a 1 cm margin, would have covered histologically identified tumor in six of the 11 cases. Treatment of the contrast enhancing area, all 'edema', and a 3 cm margin around the 'edema' would have covered histologically identified tumor in all cases. Tumors tended to track along nerve pathways. In those lesions near the midline it was common for tumor to cross the corpus callosum. We conclude that radiotherapy with fields designed to treat the contrast enhancing region alone or this region plus 'edema' with a tight margin will frequently miss tumor which can be histologically identified by our technique.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2557310

In this retrospective study, we evaluated treatment outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HFSRT) in the management of recurrent GBM and report our single-center experience. Methods: Twenty-eight patients receiving HFSRT for recurrent GBM between September 2008 and February 2014 were retrospectively assessed. Total radiotherapy dose was 25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days for all patients. High-precision, image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy was delivered with a linear accelerator using 6-MV photons using the frameless technique. Analyzed prognostic factors were age, gender, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor location, planning target volume (PTV) size, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time interval between completion of treatment with Stupp protocol at primary diagnosis and recurrence. Results: Median follow-up time was 42 months (range 2-68). Median time interval between primary chemoradiotherapy and HFSRT was 11.2 months (range 4-57.9). Median OS and PFS calculated from reirradiation was 10.3 months and 5.8 months, respectively. Longer interval between initial treatment and recurrence (p = 0.01), smaller PTV size (p = 0.001), KPS ≥70 (p = 0.005) and younger age (p = 0.004) were associated with longer OS on statistical analysis.

The cases included three males and one female, from 33 to 67 years in age (mean 49 years). Tumor resection, postoperative irradiation and chemotherapy were performed in all cases. Two patients died of local tumor recurrence after 14 and 27 months. Another patient relapsed after 10 months; however, after additional tumor resection and second line chemotherapy, she remains disease-free 41 months after the initial treatment. The fourth patient has not relapsed in the 6 months since initial treatment. The histopathology of all cases was glioblastoma with pseudopalisading necrosis. However, low-grade glioma histopathology was found in three patients. All glioblastomas were immunopositive for p53 and immunonegative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).

"""Childhood glioblastoma multiforme of the spinal cord.""","""Astrocytoma accounts for more than 50% of all central nervous system tumours diagnosed, with particular prevalence in the 15- to 34-year-old age bracket, rarely arising in younger children. In 1995, a 7-year-old boy presented in Emergency with a 3-day history of severe radicular back pain and associated muscle spasms, exacerbated by lying on his back. Both bone scan and plain X-rays were unremarkable; however, MRI showed a 3-cm space-occupying lesion at the level of T5-T6. The patient proceeded to biopsy and partial excision of the tumour through laminectomy, histology confirming an anaplastic astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme), St Anne Mayo grade 4. Treatment consisted of a radical course of radiotherapy alone, delivering a total dose of 44.8 Gy at 1.6 Gy per fraction. The treatment comprised of three phases using two oblique wedged fields on a 6 MV linear accelerator. The patient remains disease free 7 years post treatment, with the only effect noted being a slight kyphoscoliosis at the site of the laminectomy and radiation. This report highlights the efficacy of combined surgery and radiation therapy in the management of spinal cord glioblastoma multiforme in preventing tumour recurrence, with acceptable morbidity.

"""New Hypofractionation Radiation Strategies for Glioblastoma.""","""Purpose of review: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of less than 2 years despite the standard of care treatment of 6 weeks of chemoradiotherapy. We review the data investigating hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. Recent findings: Investigators have explored alternative radiotherapy strategies that shorten treatment duration with the goal of similar or improved survival while minimizing toxicity. HFRT over 1-3 weeks is already a standard of care for patients with advanced age or poor performance status. For young patients with good performance status, HFRT holds the promise of radiobiologically escalating the dose and potentially improving local control while maintaining quality of life.

"""Surgical management and outcome of newly diagnosed glioblastoma without contrast enhancement (low-grade appearance): a report of the RANO resect group.""","""Background: Resection of the contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor represents the standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. However, some tumors ultimately diagnosed as glioblastoma lack contrast enhancement and have a 'low-grade appearance' on imaging (non-CE glioblastoma). We aimed to (a) volumetrically define the value of non-CE tumor resection in the absence of contrast enhancement, and to (b) delineate outcome differences between glioblastoma patients with and without contrast enhancement. Methods: The RANO resect group retrospectively compiled a global, eight-center cohort of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma per WHO 2021 classification. The associations between postoperative tumor volumes and outcome were analyzed. Propensity score-matched analyses were constructed to compare glioblastomas with and without contrast enhancement. Results: Among 1323 newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, we identified 98 patients (7.4%) without contrast enhancement. In such patients, smaller postoperative tumor volumes were associated with more favorable outcome. There was an exponential increase in risk for death with larger residual non-CE tumor. Accordingly, extensive resection was associated with improved survival compared to lesion biopsy. These findings were retained on a multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic and clinical markers. Compared to CE glioblastoma, patients with non-CE glioblastoma had a more favorable clinical profile and superior outcome as confirmed in propensity score analyses by matching the patients with non-CE glioblastoma to patients with CE glioblastoma using a large set of clinical variables. Conclusions: The absence of contrast enhancement characterizes a less aggressive clinical phenotype of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Maximal resection of non-CE tumors has prognostic implications and translates into favorable outcome.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665776

In this study we aim to analyze the prognostic potential of edema volume and acute inflammation, quantified as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in predicting overall survival. Twenty-one patients were identified with new or recurrent GBMs that were candidates for LITT. Laser ablation was performed using standard solid tumor protocol for treatment volume, intensity and duration. Edema volume was quantified using MRI imaging, while retrospective chart review was performed to calculate NLR and survival. In patients treated with LITT for GBM, peri-tumoral vasogenic edema volumes did not significantly change post-operatively, p > 0.200, while NLR significantly increased, p = 0.0002. The degree of NLR increase correlated with longer overall survivals, and ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.827, p = 0.0112. A delta-NLR cutoff of 7.0 results in positive and negative predictive values of 78% and 75%, respectively, in predicting overall survival >1 year. Patients with with delta-NLR > 7.0 lived significantly longer that those with delta-NLR < 7.0, median survival 440 days compared to 239 days, p = 0.0297.

"""Valproic acid for the treatment of malignant gliomas: review of the preclinical rationale and published clinical results.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Valproate has been used as an anti-epileptic drug and mood stabilizer for decades. Recently, it was found to inhibit the proliferation of various cancers including glioblastoma multiforme. Areas covered: We provide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of action of valproate in gliomas, of its potential side effects and of the published clinical results obtained with this drug in glioblastomas. Valproate inhibits a subset of histone deacetylases and cellular kinases, and affects gene transcription through histone hyperacetylation, DNA hypomethylation and the modulation of several transcription factors. As a result, VPA induces differentiation of glioma cells, can prevent their invasion in surrounding tissues and may inhibit tumor angiogenesis. VPA can also inhibit DNA repair, thereby potentiating cytotoxic treatments such as chemotherapies or radiation therapy. Based on these mechanisms and case reports of glioblastoma remissions following VPA treatment, several clinical studies currently assess the therapeutic potential of VPA in glioma therapy. Expert opinion: The combination of VPA treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in glioblastoma appears a rational option that deserves well-designed prospective clinical trials that assess the efficacy and the molecular characteristics of the responding tumors in these patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22668241

Here, we generate distinct imageable syngeneic mouse GBM-tumor models and utilize RNA-sequencing, CyTOF and correlative immunohistochemistry to assess immune-profiles in these models. We identify immunologically-inert and -active syngeneic-tumor types and show that inert tumors have an immune-suppressive phenotype with numerous exhausted CD8 T cells and resident macrophages; fewer eosinophils and SiglecF+ macrophages. To mimic the clinical-settings of first line of GBM-treatment, we show that tumor-resection invigorates an anti-tumor response via increasing T cells, activated microglia and SiglecF+ macrophages and decreasing resident macrophages. A comparative CyTOF analysis of resected-tumor samples from GBM-patients and mouse GBM-tumors show stark similarities in one of the mouse GBM-tumors tested. These findings guide informed choices for use of GBM models for immunotherapeutic interventions and offer a potential to facilitate immune-therapies in GBM patients.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32764562
"""Glioblastoma in the elderly: the impact of advanced age on treatment and survival.""","""Objective: To evaluate the effects of combined treatments on the outcome and survival of elderly (≥ 65 years) patients with glioblastoma as compared with younger ones. Material and methods: Fifty consecutive elderly (≥ 65 years) patients (group A) who underwent complete or subtotal (> 80%) resection of brain glioblastoma followed by irradiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 50 glioblastoma patients aged < 65 years, treated in the same period (group B). Patient sex, tumor location, size and side, combined treatments, reoperation, progression-free survival, and overall survival were compared in the two groups by using the Kaplan-Meyer method. Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups for tumor location, size and side, and Ki-67 Li. Forty-four of 50 group B patients were treated by the Stupp protocol, whereas all group A patients underwent irradiation and adjuvant temozolomide. Second-line chemotherapy was administrated in 32% of group A and 76% of group B cases, and reoperation was performed in 16% and 36%, respectively.

Group A patients (≥ 65 years) had a median survival of 14.5 months, significantly lower than group B cases (17 months) (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Elderly patients with glioblastoma may benefit from combined treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

"""Bifunctional cancer cell-based vaccine concomitantly drives direct tumor killing and antitumor immunity.""","""The administration of inactivated tumor cells is known to induce a potent antitumor immune response; however, the efficacy of such an approach is limited by its inability to kill tumor cells before inducing the immune responses. Unlike inactivated tumor cells, living tumor cells have the ability to track and target tumors. Here, we developed a bifunctional whole cancer cell-based therapeutic with direct tumor killing and immunostimulatory roles. We repurposed the tumor cells from interferon-β (IFN-β) sensitive to resistant using CRISPR-Cas9 by knocking out the IFN-β-specific receptor and subsequently engineered them to release immunomodulatory agents IFN-β and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These engineered therapeutic tumor cells (ThTCs) eliminated established glioblastoma tumors in mice by inducing caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis, down-regulating cancer-associated fibroblast-expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, and activating antitumor immune cell trafficking and antigen-specific T cell activation signaling. This mechanism-based efficacy of ThTCs translated into a survival benefit and long-term immunity in primary, recurrent, and metastatic cancer models in immunocompetent and humanized mice. The incorporation of a double kill-switch comprising herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase and rapamycin-activated caspase 9 in ThTCs ensured the safety of our approach.

We report a case of histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme in the cerebellar vermis which occurred 9 years after treatment for gliomatosis cerebri. A 33-year-old woman presented to our department for evaluation of visual disturbance. T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed hyperintense lesions in the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. Histological examination of biopsy specimens from the left frontal lobe lesion demonstrated diffuse infiltration of glial neoplastic cells with preservation of the underlying cytoarchitecture, leading to the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri. She received 60 Gy hyperfractionated irradiation to the whole brain, and the lesion responded partially. The patient remained stable for 4 years, but T2-weighted MR imaging 5 years after the initial treatment showed enlargement of the hyperintense area. She received nimustine hydrochloride chemotherapy, and again partial response was observed. However. T1-weighted MR imaging after administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid detected enhanced lesions in the cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemisphere, and left posterior limb of the internal capsule 9 years after the initial treatment, although no abnormal findings were observed on initial and follow-up MR imaging. She underwent subtotal removal of the lesion in the cerebellar vermis. The surgical specimens were characterized by dense proliferation of atypical tumor cells with scattered mitosis and endothelial proliferation. The histological diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme. The patient received gamma knife irradiation for the remnant lesion in the cerebellar vermis, and the lesions in the cerebellar hemisphere and left posterior limb of the internal capsule, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. However, multiple enhanced lesions were detected in the cerebellar vermis 2 months after the start of the temozolomide chemotherapy, and she died 8 months later.

"""EGFR-dependent mechanisms in glioblastoma: towards a better therapeutic strategy.""","""Glioblastoma is a particularly resilient cancer, and while therapies may be able to reach the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier, they then have to deal with a highly invasive tumor that is very resistant to DNA damage. It seems clear that in order to kill aggressive glioma cells more efficiently and with fewer side effects on normal tissue, there must be a shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. Since the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in almost 50% of glioblastomas, it currently represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets. In fact, it has been associated with several distinct steps in tumorigenesis, from tumor initiation to tumor growth and survival, and also with the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. However, inhibitors of the EGFR kinase have produced poor results with this type of cancer in clinical trials, with no clear explanation for the tumor resistance observed. Here we will review what we know about the expression and function of EGFR in cancer and in particular in gliomas.

Molecular profiling experiments have revealed that these tumors are extremely heterogeneous. This heterogeneity is one of the principal challenges for developing targeted therapies. We hypothesize that despite the diverse molecular profiles, it might still be possible to identify common signaling changes that could be targeted in some or all tumors. Using a network modeling approach, we reconstruct the altered signaling pathways from tumor-specific phosphoproteomic data and known protein-protein interactions. We then develop a network-based strategy for identifying tumor specific proteins and pathways that were predicted by the models but not directly observed in the experiments. Among these hidden targets, we show that the ERK activator kinase1 (MEK1) displays increased phosphorylation in all tumors. By contrast, protein numb homolog (NUMB) is present only in the subset of the tumors that are the most invasive. Additionally, increased S100A4 is associated with only one of the tumors. Overall, our results demonstrate that despite the heterogeneity of the proteomic data, network models can identify common or tumor specific pathway-level changes.

The human glioblastoma cell line U-87 MG could be successfully engrafted in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency using the i.p., intracerebral, and s.c. routes. The latter model was elected to evaluate therapy based on its high reproducibility. Tumor growth in mice engrafted s.c. was proportionally associated with splenomegaly and leukocytosis. Multiple transfers of lethally irradiated (non-proliferating) TALL-104 cells at the tumor site resulted in about 50-70% inhibition of tumor growth as compared to untreated mice, with concomitant reduction of splenomegaly and leukocytosis. The antitumor effects were inversely proportional to the size of the tumor at initiation of therapy, 90-100% inhibition occurring in severe combined immunodeficiency mice treated from the day of U-87 MG challenge. Neither splenomegaly nor leukocytosis developed in animals in which tumor growth was completely blocked. Stimulation of TALL-104 cells with either interleukin 2 or interleukin 12 prior to irradiation and adoptive transfer increased the antitumor efficacy of the killer cells to about the same extent.

"""The significance of dose heterogeneity on the anti-tumor response of minibeam radiation therapy.""","""Background and purpose: Proton Minibeam Radiation Therapy (pMBRT) is an unconventional radiation technique based on a strong modulation of the dose deposition. Due to its specific pattern, pMBRT involves several dosimetry (peak and valley doses, peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR)) and geometrical parameters (beam width, spacing) that can influence the biological response. This study aims at contributing to the efforts to deepen the comprehension of how the various parameters relate to central biological mechanisms, particularly anti-tumor immunity, and how these correlations affect treatment outcomes with the goal to fully unleash the potential of pMBRT. We also evaluated the effects of X-ray MBRT to further elucidate the influence of peak dose and dose heterogeneity. Methods and materials: An orthotopic rat model of glioblastoma underwent several pMBRT configurations. The impact of different dosimetric parameters on survival and on the modulation of crucial mechanisms for pMBRT, such as immune response, was investigated. The latter was assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at 7 days post-irradiation. Results: Survival was improved across the various pMBRT regimens via maintaining a minimum valley dose as well as a higher dose heterogeneity, which is driven by peak dose. While the mean dose did not impact immune infiltration, a higher PVDR promoted a less immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that both tumor eradication, and immune infiltration are associated with higher dose heterogeneity. Higher dose heterogeneity was achieved by optimizing the peak dose, as well as maintaining a minimum valley dose. These parameters contributed to direct tumor eradication as well as reduction of immunosuppression, which is a departure from the more immunosuppressive tumor environment found in conventional proton therapy that delivers uniform dose distributions.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39393469

Patients with NFP-positive GBMs were younger (p < 0.0001), and their GBMs presented with more temporal lobe tumor localization (p = 0.029) and more cortical involvement (p = 0.0003). Neurofilament-negative GBMs presented with more ventricular contact (p < 0.0001) and more tumor midline crossing (p = 0.03). Median overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 13.0 and 7.6 months, respectively, for NFP-positive GBMs, and 7.0 and 5.1 months, respectively, for NFP-negative GBMs. Multivariate analysis revealed NFP immunoexpression, tumor midline crossing, complete resection, and radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy as independent factors associated with overall survival. Neurofilament protein-positive immunoexpression was associated with longer overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74; p < 0.0001) and longer PFS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.96; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Neurofilament protein-positive immunoexpression represents a strong, therapeutically independent prognostic factor for primary supratentorial GBM clinical outcome among adult patients. Neurofilament protein-GBM's unique pathological features are not only associated with distinct clinical and anatomical behavior, but are also predictive of overall patient survival and PFS. Neurofilament protein immunoexpression may help identify a distinct subgroup of primary GBMs with a favorable prognosis, which should be considered in the design of future targeted therapies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22725988
"""Treatment of Older Adult Patients with Glioblastoma: Moving towards the Inclusion of a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for Guiding Management.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, and over half of patients with newly diagnosed GBM are over the age of 65. Management of glioblastoma in older patients includes maximal safe resection followed by either radiation, chemotherapy, or combined modality treatment. Despite recent advances in the treatment of older patients with GBM, survival is still only approximately 9 months compared to approximately 15 months for the general adult population, suggesting that further research is required to optimize management in the older population. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to have a prognostic and predictive role in the management of older patients with other cancers, and domains of the CGA have demonstrated an association with outcomes in GBM in retrospective studies. Furthermore, the CGA and other geriatric assessment tools are now starting to be prospectively investigated in older GBM populations. This review aims to outline current treatment strategies for older patients with GBM, explore the rationale for inclusion of geriatric assessment in GBM management, and highlight recent data investigating its implementation into practice.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35049706
"""Multi-Arm GlioblastoMa Australasia (MAGMA): protocol for a multiarm randomised clinical trial for people affected by glioblastoma.""","""Introduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary central nervous system cancer in adults. The objective of the Multi-Arm GlioblastoMa Australasia (MAGMA) trial is to test hypotheses in real world setting to improve survival of people with GBM. Initial experimental arms are evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM). This study will compare maximal surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months with the addition of (1) 'neoadjuvant' chemotherapy beginning as soon as possible after surgery and/or (2) adjuvant chemotherapy continued until progression within the same study platform. Methods and analysis: MAGMA will establish a platform for open-label, multiarm, multicentre randomised controlled testing of treatments for GBM. The study began recruiting in September 2020 and recruitment to the initial two interventions in MAGMA is expected to continue until September 2023.Adults aged ≥18 years with ndGBM will be given the option of undergoing randomisation to each study intervention separately, thereby giving rise to a partial factorial design, with two separate randomisation time points, one for neoadjuvant therapy and one for extended therapy. Patients will have the option of being randomised at each time point or continuing on with standard treatment.The primary outcome for the study is overall survival from the date of initial surgery until death from any cause. Secondary outcomes include progression-free survival, time to first non-temozolomide treatment, overall survival from each treatment randomisation, clinically significant toxicity as measured by grade 3 or 4 adverse events and health-related quality-of-life measures. Tertiary outcomes are predictive/prognostic biomarkers and health utilities and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.The primary analysis of overall survival will be performed separately for each study intervention according to the intention to treat principle on all patients randomised to each study intervention. Ethics and dissemination: The study (Protocol version 2.0 dated 23 November 2020) was approved by a lead Human Research Ethics Committee (Sydney Local Health District: 2019/ETH13297). The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

Furthermore, immune checkpoint pathway-targeted therapies including anti- programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody have been remarkably effective in other neoplasms, and various clinical trials with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with HGG have started to date. It is possible that up-regulation of immune checkpoint molecules in tumor tissues after vaccine therapy may be one of the mechanisms of vaccine failure. Multiple preclinical studies indicate that combination therapy with vaccination and immune checkpoint blockade is effective for the treatment of malignant tumors including HGG. Thus, immunotherapy, especially combination therapy with vaccine and immune checkpoint inhibitors, may be a promising strategy for treatment of patients with HGG.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28539528
"""Effective treatment of glioblastoma requires crossing the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumors including cancer stem cells: The promise of nanomedicine.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor. Both therapeutic resistance and restricted permeation of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play a major role in the poor prognosis of GBM patients. Accumulated evidence suggests that in many human cancers, including GBM, therapeutic resistance can be attributed to a small fraction of cancer cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been shown to have stem cell-like properties that enable them to evade traditional cytotoxic therapies, and so new CSC-directed anti-cancer therapies are needed. Nanoparticles have been designed to selectively deliver payloads to relevant target cells in the body, and there is considerable interest in the use of nanoparticles for CSC-directed anti-cancer therapies. Recent advances in the field of nanomedicine offer new possibilities for overcoming CSC-mediated therapeutic resistance and thus significantly improving management of GBM. In this review, we will examine the current nanomedicine approaches for targeting CSCs and their therapeutic implications. The inhibitory effect of various nanoparticle-based drug delivery system towards CSCs in GBM tumors is the primary focus of this review.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26116770
"""National cancer database analysis of outcomes in pediatric glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma in children is an aggressive disease with no defined standard therapy. We evaluated hospital-based demographic and survival patterns obtained through the National Cancer Database to better characterize children with glioblastoma. Our study identified 1173 patients from 0 to 19 years of age between 1998 and 2011. Comparisons were made among demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and survival variables. Fifty-four percent of patients were over 10 years of age. Approximately 80% of patients underwent either partial or complete resection. Adjuvant therapy was used variably, and its use increased with patient age. Forty-eight percent of patients received the combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and 4% did not receive any treatment. As expected, patients ≤5 years of age had better 5-year survival than those ages 6-10 (P = 0.01) or 11-19 years (P = 0.0077). Other factors associated with poor survival included black race and central tumor location. Better outcomes were associated with treatment that included surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy compared to any other treatment combinations. Radiotherapy had no impact on survival in the 0 to 10-year-old age group, but was associated with improved survival for patients 11-19 years. We report an extensive demographic and survival analysis of pediatric glioblastoma. The observed differences likely reflect variances in tumor biology and likelihood of treatment receipt. Improved survival was associated with the use of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy was not associated with survival in patients younger than 10 years of age.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29532996
"""Nose-to-brain delivery of simvastatin mediated by chitosan-coated lipid-core nanocapsules allows for the treatment of glioblastoma in vivo.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal malignant brain tumor. Despite simvastatin (SVT) showing potential anticancer properties, its antitumoral effect against glioblastoma appears limited when the conventional oral administration route is selected. As a consequence, nose-to-brain delivery has been proposed as an alternative route to deliver SVT into the brain. This study aimed to prepare chitosan-coated simvastatin-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCSVT-chit) suitable for nose-to-brain delivery and capable of fostering antitumor effects against glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that the nanocapsules present adequate particle size (mean diameter below 200 nm), narrow particle size distribution (PDI < 0.2), positive zeta potential and high encapsulation efficiency (nearly 100%). In vitro cytotoxicity of LNCSVT-chit was comparable to non-encapsulated SVT in C6 rat glioma cells, whereas LNCSVT-chit were more cytotoxic than non-encapsulated SVT after 72 h of incubation against U-138 MG human glioblastoma cell line. In studies carried out in rats, LNCSVT-chit significantly enhanced the amount of drug in rat brain tissue after intranasal administration (2.4-fold) when compared with free SVT. Moreover, LNCSVT-chit promoted a significant decrease in tumor growth and malignancy in glioma-bearing rats in comparison to control and free SVT groups. Additionally, LNCSVT-chit did not cause any toxicity in treated rats. Considered overall, the results demonstrated that the nose-to-brain administration of LNCSVT-chit represents a novel potential strategy for glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35151819

We aim to assess the benefits of re-operation and salvage therapies (chemotherapy and/or re-irradiation) for recurrent GBM and to identify prognostic factors associated with better survival. All patients who underwent surgery for GBM between January 2005 and December 2012 followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, and who developed GBM recurrence on imaging were included in this retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox models in order to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS). One hundred and eighty patients treated to a dose of 60 Gy were diagnosed with recurrent GBM. At a median follow-up time of 6.2 months, the median survival (MS) from time of recurrence was 6.6 months. Sixty-nine patients underwent repeat surgery for recurrence based on imaging. To establish the benefits of repeat surgery and salvage therapies, 68 patients who underwent repeat surgery were matched to patients who did not based on extent of initial resection and presence of subventricular zone involvement at recurrence. MS for patients who underwent re-operation was 9.6 months, compared to 5.3 months for patients who did not have repeat surgery (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis in the matched pairs confirmed that repeat surgery with the addition of other salvage treatment can significantly affect patient outcome (HR 0.53).

Thirty-six patients were stratified according to functional level and randomly allocated within two weeks of operation to one of two therapeutic groups: Group 1, radiation alone; and Group 2, radiation as in Group 1 but with high-dose metronidazole. We examined survival with the Kaplan-Meier probability plot and non-parametric tests. Patients in Group 2 had a 4 1/2-month delay between relapse and subsequent death (P = 0.02). This shift of the survival curves suggests a delay in the time of tumor regrowth consistent with the ability of metronidazole to make the hypoxic tumor cells less radioresistant.

In this study we investigated cell survival to single treatments or combination of X-rays and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines (T98G and U251MG) and we attempted to identify danger signals (HMGB1 and HSP70) released by dying cells in the microenvironment that could activate antitumour immunity contributing to the therapeutic efficacy of conventional treatments. Our data suggest that HSP70 translocates from cytoplasm to extracellular environment after an increase in radiation dose and HMGB1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently is released into the extracellular space, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. We also could state that TMZ had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB1 and HSP70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect was observed in some combined treatments, depending on schedule, cell line, and timing. A big challenge in tumour therapy is, therefore, to identify the most beneficial combination and chronology of multiple treatment options to contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic outcome.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25097859

Methods: An automatic technique in AutoPlanning module of the Pinnacle3 (Philips Medical Systems, Fitchburg, WI) treatment planning system was created and validated by comparing dose distributions of automatic plans (APs) and manual plans (MPs) and by performing a blind AP-MP comparison on a cohort of 20 patients. Automatic technique was then applied to 145 patients and failures were recorded i.e. the number of times for which dose distributions produced by the automatic module were not suitable for treatment. Results: Each of the 20 APs considered in the validation step was clinically acceptable and proved to be better (15 cases) or equal (5 cases) respect to MPs. A statistically significant improvement in brain stem, optic pathways, cochleae, pituitary gland and scalp sparing was observed for APs, while no statistically significant differences were recorded in target coverage or plan parameters. For only 5 cases out of the 145 plans the operator intervention was needed in order to obtain a clinical acceptable plan, while for the remaining 140 plans the automatic created solution was suitable.

The aim of this study is to present our data achieved with an aggressive multimodality treatment. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our clinical database. All patients with histologically proven intramedullary spinal cord glioblastoma treated in our department were included in this study. Results: Four patients with intramedullary spinal cord glioblastoma were identified between 2006 and 2015, all of whom were female. Mean age at the time of surgery was 33.5 years (range 14-50 years). Tumors were located in the cervical region in 2 patients and in the thoracic region in 2 patients. All 4 patients underwent microsurgical biopsy of the tumor. After surgery, all patients received radiation and temozolomide treatment. One patient underwent additional therapy with Bevacizumab, another patient received Rapamycin and Sunitinib, and the third patient received Chlorethyl-cyclohexyl-nitroso-urea and Etoposide as additional therapy after tumor regrowth. Tumor progression occurred in a mean time of 18.2 months (6-32 months). In this series, all patients died as the result of progression of the malignancy; median survival after diagnosis was 32.5 months. Conclusions: The surgical outcome of intramedullary spinal cord glioblastoma still remains poor. Severe disability and amelioration of the neurologic status lead to reduced quality of life; however, an aggressive multimodal and interdisciplinary treatment for the disease may be associated with longer survival.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27777151
"""Treatment with 5-azacitidine delay growth of glioblastoma xenografts: a potential new treatment approach for glioblastomas.""","""Purpose: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in adults. The epigenetically active ribonucleoside analog 5-azacitidine is a new therapy option that changes tumor cell chromatin, which is frequently modified by methylation and deacetylation in malignant gliomas. Methods: In vitro, we analyzed cell viability, cell apoptosis, and migration of human GBM cells. In vivo, we established subcutaneous and intracerebral GBM mouse models originating from U87MG, U373MG, and primary GBM cells as well as one patient-derived xenograft. Xenografts were treated with 5-azacitidine as well as valproic acid, bevacizumab, temozolomide, and phosphate buffered saline. The tumor sizes and Ki67 proliferation indices were determined. Glioma angiogenesis was examined immunohistochemically by expression analysis of endothelial cells (CD31) and pericytes (PDGFRβ). Results: In vitro, 5-azacitidine treatment significantly reduced human glioblastoma cell viability, increased cellular apoptosis, and reduced cellular migration. In vivo, 5-azacitidine significantly reduced growth in two intracerebral GBM models. Notably, this was also shown for a xenograft established from a patient surgery sample; whereas, epigenetically acting valproic acid did not show any growth reduction. Highly vascularized tumors responded to treatment, whereas low-vascularized xenografts showed no response. Furthermore, intracerebral glioblastomas treated with 5-azacitidine showed a clearly visible reduction of tumor angiogenesis and lower numbers of endothelial cells and tumor vessel pericytes. Conclusions: Our data show significant growth inhibition as well as antiangiogenic effects in intracerebral as well as patient-derived GBM xenografts.

Despite the relatively leaky nature of GBM blood vessels, effective delivery of antitumor therapeutics has been a major challenge due to the complications caused by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the highly torturous nature of newly formed tumor vasculature (blood tumor barrier-BTB). External beam radiotherapy was previously shown to be an effective means of permeabilizing central nervous system (CNS) barriers. By using targeted short-ranged radionuclides, we show for the first time that our targeted actinium-225-labeled αvβ3-specific liposomes (225Ac-IA-TLs) caused catastrophic double stranded DNA breaks and significantly enhanced the permeability of BBB and BTB in mice bearing orthotopic GBMs. Histologic studies revealed characteristic α-particle induced double strand breaks within tumors but was not significantly present in normal brain regions away from the tumor where BBB permeability was observed. These findings indicate that the enhanced vascular permeability in these distal regions did not result from direct α-particle-induced DNA damage. On the basis of these results, in addition to their direct antitumor effects, 225Ac-IA-TLs can potentially be used to enhance the permeability of BBB and BTB for effective delivery of systemically administered antitumor therapeutics.

In order to assess the differences in volume and shape of the radiotherapy target, the use of pre-operative vs post-operative/pre-radiotherapy T(1) and T(2) weighted MRI was compared. Methods: 4 CTVs were delineated in 24 patients pre-operatively and post-operatively using T(1) contrast-enhanced (T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV) and T(2) weighted images (T2(PRE)CTV and T2(POST)CTV). Pre-operative MRI examinations were performed the day before surgery, whereas post-operative examinations were acquired 1 month after surgery and before chemoradiation. A concordance index (CI) was defined as the ratio between the overlapping and composite volumes. Results: The volumes of T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV were not statistically different (248 ± 88 vs 254 ± 101), although volume differences >100 cm(3) were observed in 6 out of 24 patients. A marked increase due to tumour progression was shown in three patients. Three patients showed a decrease because of a reduced mass effect. A significant reduction occurred between pre-operative and post-operative T(2) volumes (139 ± 68 vs 78 ± 59). Lack of concordance was observed between T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV (CI = 0.67 ± 0.09), T2(PRE)CTV and T2(POST)CTV (CI = 0.39 ± 0.20) and comparing the portion of the T1(PRE)CTV and T1(POST)CTV not covered by that defined on T2(PRE)CTV images (CI = 0.45 ± 0.16 and 0.44 ± 0.17, respectively). Conclusion: Using T(2) MRI, huge variations can be observed in peritumoural oedema, which are probably due to steroid treatment. Using T(1) MRI, brain shifts after surgery and possible progressive enhancing lesions produce substantial differences in CTVs.

Expert annotation and WGA had good agreement on identifying variants [mean sensitivity = 0.71, SD = 0.18 and positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.80, SD = 0.20] and drug targets when the same variants were called (mean sensitivity = 0.74, SD = 0.34 and PPV = 0.79, SD = 0.23) across patients. Clinicians used the information to modify their treatment plan 10% of the time. Conclusion: These results present the first comprehensive comparison of technical and machine augmented analysis of targeted panel and WGS/RNA-seq to identify potential cancer treatments.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31023376
"""Novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to malignant glioma.""","""Glioblastomas (World Health Organisation (WHO) grade IV) and anaplastic gliomas (astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas) (WHO grade III) are collectively referred to as malignant gliomas. The diagnosis of malignant glioma may be suspected based on clinical history and neuroimaging findings, but histological confirmation remains the diagnostic 'gold standard'. Molecular markers such as 1p/19q codeletion and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. O-methylguanylmethyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is another favourable prognostic marker and predicts benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy in glioblastoma. Additionally, the extent of neurosurgical resection is a prognostic factor. Radiotherapy of the involved brain region or chemotherapy using the alkylating agent, temozolomide, are common therapeutic options for patients with anaplastic glioma. In contrast, temozolomide plus radiotherapy is the standard of care for most patients with glioblastoma. The increasing population of elderly patients with glioblastoma represents a particular challenge, with surgery followed by radiotherapy as the standard of care. Contemporary clinical studies focus on the role of angiogenesis. Specifically, pivotal phase III studies exploring the antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bevacizumab, and the αvβ3/5 antagonist, cilengitide, in the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma have completed enrolment. Moreover, a broad spectrum of other experimental treatment approaches, including immunotherapy with vaccines against glioma-associated antigens, are currently being explored in phase I/II clinical trials.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21607882

"""Deep Penetrating and Sensitive Targeted Magnetic Particle Imaging and Photothermal Therapy of Early-Stage Glioblastoma Based on a Biomimetic Nanoplatform.""","""Early diagnosis can effectively improve the survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A specific imaging technique that is simultaneously deep penetrating and sensitive to small tissue changes is desired to identify GBM. Due to its excellent features in signal contrast, detection sensitivity, and none or little attenuation in tissue, magnetic particle imaging (MPI) possesses great potential in cancer diagnosis, especially when the imaging modality is equipped with specifically targeted nanoprobes. However, when gliomas are small, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is complete and prevents nanoprobes from entering the brain, which negates the theranostic effect. This study proposes a biomimetic nanoplatform that assist the MPI tracers in breaking through the BBB and then demonstrate a targeted and sensitive diagnosis of GBM. Afterward, the photothermal therapy and immune regulation show an excellent therapeutic effect on the GBM. It is experimentally confirmed that the MPI signal does not decay with tissue depth and shows excellent sensitivity for thousands-cells. Only small animals are conducted in this study due to the limitations of the current commercial MPI scanner, however, this research theoretically enables large animal and human studies, which encourages a promising pathway toward the noninvasive diagnosis of early-stage GBM in clinics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37150856

Methods: Forty patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma exhibiting enhancing lesions after completion of chemoradiation therapy were enrolled in the study, which were then classified as tumour progression and pseudoprogression. All patients underwent conventional and multi-b diffusion-weighted MRI. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from a monoexponential model, the true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) from a biexponential model, and the distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) and intravoxel heterogeneity index (α) from a stretched-exponential model were compared between tumour progression and pseudoprogression groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the diagnostic performance of different DWI parameters. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the consistency of measurements. Results: The values of ADC, D, DDC, and α values were lower in tumour progression patients than that in pseudoprogression patients (p < 0.05). The values of D* and f were higher in tumour progression patients than that in pseudoprogression patients (p < 0.05). Diagnostic accuracy for differentiating tumour progression from pseudoprogression was highest for α(AUC = 0.94) than that for ADC (AUC = 0.91), D (AUC = 0.92), D* (AUC = 0.81), f (AUC = 0.75), and DDC (AUC = 0.88).

"""Prognostic value of MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation in glioblastomas depends on IDH1 mutation.""","""Several molecular markers have been proposed as predictors of outcome in patients with glioblastomas. We investigated the prognostic significance of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and TP53 mutation status dependent on isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation in glioblastoma patients. A cohort of 78 patients with histologically confirmed glioblastomas treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the prognostic value of MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation status with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). It was revealed that mutations in IDH1, promoter methylation of MGMT, TP53 mutation, age, Karnofsky performance status (KFS), and extension of resection were independent prognostic factors. In patients with an IDH1 mutation, those with an MGMT methylation were associated with longer PFS (p=0.016) and OS (p=0.013). Nevertheless, the presence of TP53 mutation could stratify the PFS and OS of patients with IDH1 wild type (p=0.003 and 0.029 respectively, log-rank). The MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutation were associated with a favorable outcome of patients with and without mutant IDH1, respectively. The results indicate that glioblastomas with MGMT methylation or TP53 mutations have improved survival that may be influenced by IDH1 mutation status.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25605197
"""Metronomic Photodynamic Therapy with Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles in Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment.""","""Alternative therapies such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) that combine light, oxygen and photosensitizers (PSs) have been proposed for glioblastoma (GBM) management to overcome conventional treatment issues. An important disadvantage of PDT using a high light irradiance (fluence rate) (cPDT) is the abrupt oxygen consumption that leads to resistance to the treatment. PDT metronomic regimens (mPDT) involving administering light at a low irradiation intensity over a relatively long period of time could be an alternative to circumvent the limitations of conventional PDT protocols. The main objective of the present work was to compare the effectiveness of PDT with an advanced PS based on conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPN) developed by our group in two irradiation modalities: cPDT and mPDT. The in vitro evaluation was carried out based on cell viability, the impact on the macrophage population of the tumor microenvironment in co-culture conditions and the modulation of HIF-1α as an indirect indicator of oxygen consumption. mPDT regimens with CPNs resulted in more effective cell death, a lower activation of molecular pathways of therapeutic resistance and macrophage polarization towards an antitumoral phenotype.

"""Radiotherapy, Lymphopenia, and Host Immune Capacity in Glioblastoma: A Potentially Actionable Toxicity Associated With Reduced Efficacy of Radiotherapy.""","""Radiotherapy is cytotoxic to tumor cells and is therefore a critical component of therapy for many malignancies, including glioblastoma (GBM). We now appreciate the value of the immunomodulatory effects of radiation that may be important to overall therapeutic success in some patients with this primary brain tumor. Although potentially beneficial immune-stimulating properties of radiotherapy treatment have been the focus of recent study, this modality is actually at the same time associated with the depletion of lymphocytes, which are crucial to the defense against neoplastic development and progression. In this review, we describe the association of systemic lymphopenia with poor tumor outcome, present evidence that radiotherapy is an important contributing cause of lymphodepletion, describe the systemic immune context of tumor and brain injury that contributes to immunosuppression, describe other contributing factors to lymphopenia including concomitant medications and treatments, and speculate about the role of the normal physiologic response to brain injury in the immunosuppressive dynamics of GBM. Radiotherapy is one significant and potentially actionable iatrogenic suppressor of immune response that may be limiting the success of therapy in GBM and other tumor types. Altered strategies for radiotherapy more permissive of a vigorous antineoplastic immune response may improve outcome for malignancy.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31232425

In the absence of a standard of care we aimed to investigate institutional treatment strategies to identify similarities and differences in the pattern of care for recurrent glioblastoma. We investigated re-treatment criteria and therapeutic pathways for recurrent glioblastoma of eight neuro-oncology centres in Switzerland having an established multidisciplinary tumour-board conference. Decision algorithms, differences and consensus were analysed using the objective consensus methodology. A total of 16 different treatment recommendations were identified based on combinations of eight different decision criteria. The set of criteria implemented as well as the set of treatments offered was different in each centre. For specific situations, up to 6 different treatment recommendations were provided by the eight centres. The only wide-range consensus identified was to offer best supportive care to unfit patients. A majority recommendation was identified for non-operable large early recurrence with unmethylated MGMT promoter status in the fit patients: here bevacizumab was offered. In fit patients with late recurrent non-operable MGMT promoter methylated glioblastoma temozolomide was recommended by most. No other majority recommendations were present. In the absence of strong evidence we identified few consensus recommendations in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. This contrasts the limited availability of single drugs and treatment modalities.

"""Convection-enhanced delivery to achieve widespread distribution of viral vectors: Predicting clinical implementation.""","""Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been introduced to overcome the inability of many pharmacological agents to cross the blood-brain barrier, making these agents potentially effective in situ and suitable for the treatment of brain disorders. To achieve CED, drugs are pumped continuously through stereotactically placed catheters directly into the brain, or into or within the vicinity of a tumor mass. This medical technology has been applied to the local delivery of small-molecule drugs, including standard chemotherapeutics, and novel experimental targeted drugs, including targeted cytotoxins. When administered by an experienced clinician, the CED of a molecularly targeted cytotoxin has resulted in a significantly better outcome in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). More recent gene therapy clinical trials have also demonstrated that such treatments impact on the course of the disease when administered using CED. The use of CED to administer gene therapy for brain neoplasms may improve the efficacy of this treatment. However, CED is under development, and issues such as the type of catheters to use and their placement, as well as the pharmacological formulation and stability of drugs or vectors, are being studied to achieve efficacious delivery into the desired regions of the diseased brain.

"""Identification of Potent VEGF Inhibitors for the Clinical Treatment of Glioblastoma, A Virtual Screening Approach.""","""Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression could be found in all glioblastomas. VEGF takes part in numerous changes including the endothelial cell proliferation, the vasculature of solid tumor: its survival invasion, and migration, chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, vasodilation and vascular permeability. VEGF inhibition can be a smart therapeutic strategy because it is extremely specific and less toxic than cytotoxic therapy. To establish better inhibition of VEGF than the current inhibitors, present study approach is by molecular docking, virtual screening to illustrate the inhibitor with superior affinity against VEGF to have a cautious pharma profile. To retrieve the best established and high-affinity high affinity molecule, Molegro Virtual Docker software was executed. The high-affinity scoring compounds were subjected to further similarity search to retrieve the drugs with similar properties from pubchem database. The completion of virtual screening reveals that PubChem compound SCHEMBL1250485 (PubChem CID: 66965667) has the highest affinity. The study of the drug-likeness was verified using OSIRIS Property Explorer software which supported the virtual screened result. Further ADMET study and drug comparative study strongly prove the superiority of the new established inhibitor with lesser rerank score and toxicity.

The first randomized study of interstitial hyperthermia in glioblastoma multiforme showed a survival benefit for hyperthermia, though small. Improvement of the heating technique could lead to improved results. The purpose of this feasibility study is to present the clinical and thermal data of application of an improved interstitial hyperthermia system. Methods and materials: Six patients with a glioblastoma multiforme were treated with interstitial hyperthermia using the Multi Electrode Current Source Interstitial Hyperthermia (MECS-IHT) system. The MECS-IHT system has the capability of spatial monitoring of temperature and individually steering of heating electrodes. Three sessions were given aiming at a steady state temperature of 42 degrees C for 1 h, with an interval of 3-4 days, during an external irradiation scheme of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. Hyperthermia was delivered with a mean of 10 catheters, 18 heating electrodes and 38 thermal probes per patient. Results: Sub-optimal temperatures were encountered in the first two patients leading to adjustments in technique thereafter with subsequent improvement of thermal data. With a catheter spacing of 11-12 mm, measurements yielded a mean T(90), T(50) and T(10) of 39.9, 43.7 and 45.2 degrees C, respectively, over three sessions in the last patient. The power per electrode to reach this temperature distribution varied from 25-100% of full power in each of the last four patients. Thermal data were reproducible over the three sessions. Acute toxicity was minimal. Conclusions: Despite the spatial steering capabilities of the MECS-IHT system, a large temperature heterogeneity was encountered. The heterogeneity was the reason to limit the catheter spacing to 11-12 mm, thus making only small tumour volumes feasible for interstitial heating.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277019

Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing glioma-initiating cells (GICs) at the apex. To discover new GIC targets, we used in vivo delivery of phage display technology to screen for molecules selectively binding GICs that may be amenable for targeting. Phage display leverages large, diverse peptide libraries to identify interactions with molecules in their native conformation. We delivered a bacteriophage peptide library intravenously to a glioblastoma xenograft in vivo then derived GICs. Phage peptides bound to GICs were analyzed for their corresponding proteins and ranked based on prognostic value, identifying VAV3, a Rho guanine exchange factor involved tumor invasion, and CD97 (cluster of differentiation marker 97), an adhesion G-protein-coupled-receptor upstream of Rho, as potentially enriched in GICs. We confirmed that both VAV3 and CD97 were preferentially expressed by tumor cells expressing GIC markers. VAV3 expression correlated with increased activity of its downstream mediator, Rac1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), in GICs. Furthermore, targeting VAV3 by ribonucleic acid interference decreased GIC growth, migration, invasion and in vivo tumorigenesis. As CD97 is a cell surface protein, CD97 selection enriched for sphere formation, a surrogate of self-renewal. In silico analysis demonstrated VAV3 and CD97 are highly expressed in tumors and inform poor survival and tumor grade, and more common with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations.

Herein, we proposed a photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided GBM high-efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) based on a second near-infrared (NIR-II) absorptive polymer (PDTP-TBZ) conjugated with intense electron donor dithienopyrrole (DTP) and strong electron acceptor thiadiazolobenzotriazole (TBZ). By nanoprecipitation, PDTP-TBZ can form into nanoparticles (PT NPs), and c(RGDfK) cyclic peptide with integrin-specific targeting was then modified on the surface of PT NPs to obtain the ability of active targeting GBM multifunctional nano-reagent (cRGD@PT NPs). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that cRGD@PT NPs as NIR-II GBM phototheranostic reagents can greatly improve the enrichment rate at tumor sites under PAI monitoring, and carry out precise NIR-II PTT with high effective tumor cell phototoxicity and high biological safety. Thus, cRGD@PT NPs have great potential for the future GBM phototheranostic application in clinic. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we successfully constructed an intense electron donor dithienopyrrole (DTP) with a strong electron acceptor thiadiazolobenzotriazole (TBZ) into a novel NIR-II optical absorptive conjugated polymer (PDTP-TBZ). Then, the c(RGDfK) cyclic peptide was modified on the surface of PT NPs to obtain multifunctional nanodiagnostic reagents (cRGD@PT NPs) that can effectively target GBM neovascularization and tumor cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that cRGD@PT NPs possess high photothermal conversion efficiency and practical photoacoustic imaging capability under 1064 nm laser irradiation. The results of this work suggested that cRGD@PT NPs have great potential in efficient NIR-II PTT guided by accurate PAI, which provide a good perspective for the treatment and diagnosis of GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36031034
"""Early investigation of a novel SI306 theranostic prodrug for glioblastoma treatment.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Theranostic, combining therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, arises as a successful strategy to improve patient outcomes through personalized medicine. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (nRTK) whose involvement in GBM has been extensively demonstrated. Our previous research highlighted the effectiveness of the pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine SI306 and its more soluble prodrug CMP1 as Src inhibitors both in in vitro and in vivo GBM models. In this scenario, we decided to develop a theranostic prodrug of SI306, ProSI-DOTA(68 Ga) 1, which was designed to target GBM cells after hydrolysis and follow-up on the disease's progression and improve the therapy's outcome. First, the corresponding nonradioactive prodrug 2 was tested to evaluate its ADME profile and biological activity. It showed good metabolic stability, no inhibition of CYP3A4, suboptimal aqueous solubility, and slight gastrointestinal and blood-brain barrier passive permeability. Compound 2 exhibited a drastic reduction of cell vitality after 72 h on two different GBM cell lines (GL261 and U87MG). Then, 2 was subjected to complexation with the radionuclide Gallium-68 to give ProSI-DOTA(68 Ga) 1. The cellular uptake of 1 was evaluated on GBM cells, highlighting a slight but significant time-dependent uptake. The data obtained from our preliminary studies reflect the physiochemical properties of 1. The use of an alternative route of administration, such as the intranasal route, could overcome the physiochemical limitations and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of 1, paving the way for its future development.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38349262

"""High-dose-rate stereotactic brachytherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiformes.""","""Purpose: To evaluate high-dose-rate (HDR) stereotactic brachytherapy (STBT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Materials and methods: Between August 1994 and December 1998, 28 patients with newly diagnosed GBM underwent surgery, external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and HDR STBT. STBT eligibility criteria included unifocal lesions, residual tumor < or = 6 cm in maximum diameter, supratentorial lesions, tumors not crossing the midline, tumors without subependymal spread and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) > 60. STBT was delivered over five consecutive days with two fractions per day for a total median dose of 30 Gy. Twenty-eight STBT eligible GBM patients treated with surgery and EBRT only over the same period were matched controls. Results: Median survival times for the STBT group and controls were 19.5 versus 12.5 months; one and two year survival rates were 89% versus 42% and 61% versus 28%, respectively (p = 0.12). Using multivariate analysis, age, KPS and HDR STBT were significant factors predicting survival. By RPA class, 2-year survival rates for STBT and controls were: III--78% versus 50%; IV--40% versus 0%; V--21% versus 15%, respectively. Corresponding median survival times in months were: 41.6 versus 21.2 (p = 0.39); 16.7 versus 12.1 (p = 0.36); 18.7 versus 10.6 (p = 0.02). No major complications were found in the STBT arm. Conclusions: Because of small patient numbers, median survival time increases were only statistically significant in the RPA Class V patients, but a strong survival time trend emerged favoring patients undergoing HDR STBT.

"""A Window of Opportunity to Overcome Therapeutic Failure in Neuro-Oncology.""","""Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain neoplasm and it remains one of the most difficult-to-treat human cancers despite decades of discovery and translational and clinical research. Many advances have been made in our understanding of the genetics and epigenetics of gliomas in general; yet, there remains an urgent need to develop novel agents that will improve the survival of patients with this deadly disease. What sets glioblastoma apart from all other cancers is that it develops and spreads within an organ that renders tumor cells inaccessible to most systemically administered agents because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier. Inadequate drug penetration into the central nervous system is often cited as the most common cause of trial failure in neuro-oncology, and even so-called brain-penetrant therapeutics may not reach biologically relevant concentrations in tumor cells. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel therapy is a cornerstone of drug development, but few trials for glioma therapeutics have incorporated these basic elements in an organ-specific manner. Window-of-opportunity clinical trial designs can provide early insight into the biological plausibility of a novel therapeutic strategy in the clinical setting. A variety of window-of-opportunity trial designs, which take into account the limited access to treated tissue and the challenges with obtaining pretreatment control tissues, have been used for the initial development of traditional and targeted small-molecule drugs and biologic therapies, including immunotherapies and oncolytic viral therapies. Early-stage development of glioma therapeutics should include a window-of-opportunity component whenever feasible.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35580289

Due to its heterogeneous nature, the use of selective therapy for specific targeting of tumor cells is of particular importance. Although many treatment alternatives which include surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are available, the prognosis of the disease is very poor. Combination therapy is becoming the foundation of modern antitumor therapy and it is continuously evolving and developing innovative drug regimens as evidenced by ongoing preclinical and clinical trials.

Radiation was delivered to the whole brain at 1.8 Gy per daily treatment for 5 weeks to a total dose of 45 Gy. The radiation portals were then reduced in size to encompass the known volume of tumor, as determined by the presurgical contrast-enhancing ring on computed tomography (CT), plus a 3-cm margin. An additional 10 treatments of 2 Gy each were given to the smaller volume, to bring the total tumor dose to 65 Gy in 7 weeks. This report describes the experience of the first 18 patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center on this study, whose median follow-up time from the date of surgery is 77 weeks (62-115 w). Immediately following Fluosol administration on a Monday, patients breathed 100% oxygen for at least 45 minutes prior to and throughout their radiation treatment. On each subsequent day of the weeks in which they received Fluosol, patients breathed 100% oxygen. Hematology and blood chemistries were also drawn prior to Fluosol treatment each Friday during treatment and at the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up visits. The median age of the patients was 45 years (16-72); 13 patients were male and 15 carried the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (3 had anaplastic astrocytoma). Two thirds of the patients had an initial allergic reaction to the Fluosol consisting of back pain, shortness of breath, and flushing, but all responded to 50-100 mg of Benadryl. During radiation therapy, all patients developed scalp erythema and complete alopecia by the end of 3 weeks, but no patient required a treatment rest. The serum levels of SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase were examined before and throughout the Fluosol treatment and, by week 5, 11/18 of the patients had increased values of all three enzymes above the upper range of normal. These increases persisted through the end of treatment, but most values returned to essentially normal by the 3-month follow-up visit. We conclude that Fluosol, given in the manner described above, appears to be associated with minimal significant side effects and no changes could be detected in the white matter of any of the patients at the time of their magnetic resonance imaging study at 6 months follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2168356
"""Evolution of Magnetic Hyperthermia for Glioblastoma Multiforme Therapy.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of glial tumor, and despite many recent advances, its prognosis remains dismal. Hence, new therapeutic approaches for successful GBM treatment are urgently required. Magnetic hyperthermia-mediated cancer therapy (MHCT), which is based on heating the tumor tissues using magnetic nanoparticles on exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF), has shown promising results in the preclinical studies conducted so far. The aim of this Review is to evaluate the progression of MHCT for GBM treatment and to determine its effectiveness on the treatment either alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. The preclinical studies presented MHCT as an effective treatment module for the reduction of tumor cell growth and increase in survival of the tumor models used. Over the years, much research has been done to prove MHCT alone as the missing notch for successful GBM therapy. However, very few combinatorial studies have been reported. Some of the clinical studies carried out so far depicted that MHCT could be applied safely while possessing minimal side effects.

"""Induction of apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppression of ERK/NF-kappaB signalling participate in anti-glioblastoma of imipramine.""","""Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of brain tumour, with poor prognosis even after standard treatment such as surgical resection, temozolomide and radiation therapy. The overexpression of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in glioblastomas is recognized as an important treatment target. Thus, an urgent need regarding glioblastomas is the development of a new, suitable agent that may show potential for the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has anti-inflammatory actions against inflamed glial cells; additionally, imipramine can induce glioblastoma toxicity via the activation of autophagy. However, whether imipramine can suppress glioblastoma progression via the induction of apoptosis and blockage of ERK/NF-κB signalling remains unclear. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of imipramine on apoptotic signalling and ERK/NF-κB-mediated glioblastoma progression by using cell proliferation (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT] assay), flow cytometry, Western blotting, and cell invasion/migration assay analysis in vitro. The ERK and NF-κB inhibitory capacity of imipramine is detected by NF-κB reporter gene assay and Western blotting. Additionally, a glioblastoma-bearing animal model was used to validate the therapeutic efficacy and general toxicity of imipramine. Our results demonstrated that imipramine successfully triggered apoptosis through extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and suppressed the invasion/migration ability of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, imipramine effectively suppressed glioblastoma progression in vivo via the inhibition of the ERK/NF-κB pathway. In summary, imipramine is a potential anti-glioblastoma drug which induces apoptosis and has the capacity to inhibit ERK/NF-κB signalling.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149465
"""Delayed Effect of Dendritic Cells Vaccination on Survival in Glioblastoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.""","""Background: Dendritic cell vaccination (DCV) strategies, thanks to a complex immune response, may flare tumor regression and improve patients' long-term survival. This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of DCV for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients in clinical trials. Methods: The study databases, including PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane, were searched by two blinded investigators considering eligible studies based on the following keywords: 'glioblastoma multiforme', 'dendritic cell', 'vaccination', 'immunotherapy', 'immune system', 'immune response', 'chemotherapy', 'recurrence', and 'temozolomide'. Among the 157 screened, only 15 articles were eligible for the final analysis. Results: Regimens including DCV showed no effect on 6-month progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 1.385, 95% CI: 0.822-2.335, p = 0.673) or on 6-month overall survival (OS, HR = 1.408, 95% CI: 0.882-2.248, p = 0.754). In contrast, DCV led to significantly longer 1-year OS (HR = 1.936, 95% CI: 1.396-2.85, p = 0.001) and longer 2-year OS (HR = 3.670, 95% CI: 2.291-5.879, p = 0.001) versus control groups. Hence, introducing DCV could lead to increased 1 and 2-year survival of patients by 1.9 and 3.6 times, respectively. Conclusion: Antitumor regimens including DCV can effectively improve mid-term survival in patients suffering glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but its impact emerges only after one year from vaccination. These data indicate the need for more time to achieve an anti-GBM immune response and suggest additional therapeutics, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to empower an earlier DCV action in patients affected by a very poor prognosis.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35200574

"""Differential effects of radiation fractionation regimens on glioblastoma.""","""Background: Radiotherapy (RT) is a mainstay of treatment for patients with glioblastoma (GB). Early clinical trials show that short course hypofractionation showed no survival benefit compared to conventional regimens with or without temozolomide chemotherapy (TMZ) but reduces the number of doses required. Concerns around delayed neurological deficits and reduced cognition from short course hypofractionated RT remain a concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increased interfractional time using two different radiation fractionation regimens on GB. Methods: The radiobiological effect of increasing doses 0-20 Gy x-ray photon RT on Gl261 and CT2A GB cell lines was compared by colony forming assay, DNA damage by alkaline comet assay, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell cycle, and caspase-3/7 by MUSE® flow cytometric analyses, and protein expression by western blot analyses. Conventional (20 Gy/10 fractions) and hypofractionated (20 Gy/4 fractions spaced 72 h apart) RT regimens with and without TMZ (200 mg/kg/day) were performed in syngeneic Gl261 and CT2A intracranial mouse models using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (Xstrahl Inc.). Results: X-ray photon radiation dose-dependently increased reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, autophagy, and caspase 3/7-mediated apoptotic cell death. While the conventional fractionated dose regimen of 20 Gy/10 f was effective at inducing cell death via the above mechanism, this was exceeded by a 20 Gy/4 f regimen which improved median survival and histopathology in Gl261-tumor bearing mice, and eradicated tumors in CT2A tumors with no additional toxicity. Conclusions: Spacing of hypofractionated RT doses 72 h apart showed increased median survival and tumor control via increased activation of RT-mediated cell death, with no observed increased in radiotoxicity. This supports further exploration of differential RT fractionated regimens in GB clinical trials to reduce delayed neurological radiotoxicity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35073960
"""Novel chemo-sensitizing agent, ERW1227B, impairs cellular motility and enhances cell death in glioblastomas.""","""Glioblastomas display variable phenotypes that include increased drug-resistance associated with enhanced migratory and anti-apoptotic characteristics. These shared characteristics contribute to failure of clinical treatment regimens. Identification of novel compounds that promote cell death and impair cellular motility is a logical strategy to develop more effective clinical protocols. We recently described the ability of the small molecule, KCC009, a tissue transglutaminase (TG2) inhibitor, to sensitize glioblastoma cells to chemotherapy. In the current study, we synthesized a series of related compounds that show variable ability to promote cell death and impair motility in glioblastomas, irrespective of their ability to inhibit TG2. Each compound has a 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroisoxazole component that presumably reacts with nucleophilic cysteine thiol residues in the active sites of proteins that have an affinity to the small molecule. Our studies focused on the effects of the compound, ERW1227B. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with ERW1227B was associated with both down-regulation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, which enhanced cell death; as well as disruption of focal adhesive complexes and intracellular actin fibers, which impaired cellular mobility. Bioassays as well as time-lapse photography of glioblastoma cells treated with ERW1227B showed cell death and rapid loss of cellular motility. Mice studies with in vivo glioblastoma models demonstrated the ability of ERW1227B to sensitize tumor cells to cell death after treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation.

Conveniently, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), the prodrug that is administered for PDT, is the only drug approved for fluorescence-guided resection of glioblastoma, enabling dual detection and treatment of malignant cells. NaLuF4:Pr3+ nanoparticles were synthesized and spectroscopically evaluated at a range of Pr3+ concentrations. This generated radioluminescent nanoparticles with strong emissions from the 1S0 excited state of Pr3+, which overlaps with the Soret band of PPIX to perform photodynamic therapy. The spectral overlap between the nanoparticles and PPIX improved treatment outcomes for U251 cells, which were used as a model for the thin tumor margin. In addition to sensitizing PPIX to induce X-PDT, our nanoparticles exhibit strong radiosensitizing properties through a radiation dose-enhancement effect.

Exploitation of the full repertoire of tumour antigens-that is, both unmutated antigens and neoepitopes-may offer more effective immunotherapies, especially for tumours with a low mutational load. Here, in the phase I trial GAPVAC-101 of the Glioma Actively Personalized Vaccine Consortium (GAPVAC), we integrated highly individualized vaccinations with both types of tumour antigens into standard care to optimally exploit the limited target space for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Fifteen patients with glioblastomas positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 were treated with a vaccine (APVAC1) derived from a premanufactured library of unmutated antigens followed by treatment with APVAC2, which preferentially targeted neoepitopes. Personalization was based on mutations and analyses of the transcriptomes and immunopeptidomes of the individual tumours. The GAPVAC approach was feasible and vaccines that had poly-ICLC (polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid-poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as adjuvants displayed favourable safety and strong immunogenicity.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of early changes of FET uptake after postoperative RCX in glioblastomas. Methods and materials: Twenty-two patients with glioblastoma were treated by surgery and subsequent RCX (whole dose 60-72 Gy). The FET-PET studies were performed before RCX, 7-10 days and 6-8 weeks after completion of RCX. Early treatment response in PET was defined as a decrease of the maximal tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR(max)) of FET uptake after RCX of more than 10%. The prognostic value of early changes of FET uptake after RCX was evaluated using Kaplan-Maier estimates for median disease-free survival and overall survival. Results: The median overall and disease-free survival of the patients was 14.8 and 7.8 months. There were 16 early responders in FET-PET (72.7%) and 6 nonresponders (27.3%). Early PET responders had a significantly longer median disease-free survival (10.3 vs. 5.8 months; p < 0.01) and overall survival ('not reached' vs. 9.3 months; p < 0.001).

Experimental data implicates histone H3 lysine (K) methyltransferases SETDB1 and SUV39H1 into glioma pathobiology, whereas linker histone variant H1.0 and H4K20me3 reportedly affect prognosis. We investigated the expression of H3K9me3 and its methyltransferases along with H4K20me3 and H1x in 101 astrocytic tumors with regard to clinicopathological characteristics and survival. The effect of SUV39H1 inhibition by chaetocin on the proliferation, colony formation and migration of T98G cells was also examined. SETDB1 and cytoplasmic SUV39H1 levels increased from normal brain through low-grade to high-grade tumors, nuclear SUV39H1 correlating inversely with grade. H3K9me3 immunoreactivity was higher in normal brain showing no association with grade, whereas H1x and H4K20me3 expression was higher in grade 2 than in normal brain or high grades. These expression patterns of H1x, H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 were verified by Western immunoblotting. Chaetocin treatment significantly reduced proliferation, clonogenic potential and migratory ability of T98G cells. H1x was an independent favorable prognosticator in glioblastomas, this effect being validated in an independent set of 66 patients. Diminished nuclear SUV39H1 expression adversely affected survival in univariate analysis. In conclusion, H4K20me3 and H3K9 methyltransferases are differentially implicated in astroglial tumor progression. Deregulation of H1x emerges as a prognostic biomarker.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602259
"""Glioblastoma therapy: going beyond Hercules Columns.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Median survival from the time of diagnosis is 14 months, with less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years. Despite advances in deciphering the complex biology of these tumors, the overall prognosis has only slightly improved in the past three decades. The clinical failure of many therapeutic approaches can be explained by the following considerations: the location of tumors within the brain presents a special set of challenges, including ability of drugs to cross the BBB; cancer cells have unstable genetic structures, very susceptible to mutations; cancer cells have an amalgam of different genetic defects that respond in different ways to any given treatment agent; and, infiltrating and apparently normal but 'activated' cells are evident in the brain surrounding the main tumor. In this way, the biologic phenomena of the 'normal brain' adjacent to the enhanced tumor could allow us to understand the first steps of cancerogenesis and, consequently, to interfere with the pathways responsible for tumor growth and recurrence.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367204
"""Graphdiyne nanoplatforms for photothermal-ferroptosis combination therapy against glioblastoma.""","""Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant tumors of the central nervous system and has a poor prognosis. GBM cells are highly sensitive to ferroptosis and heat, suggesting thermotherapy-ferroptosis as a new strategy for GBM treatment. With its biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency, graphdiyne (GDY) has become a high-profile nanomaterial. Here, the ferroptosis inducer FIN56 was employed to construct GDY-FIN56-RAP (GFR) polymer self-assembled nanoplatforms against GBM. GDY could effectively load FIN56 and FIN56 released from GFR in a pH-dependent manner. The GFR nanoplatforms possessed the advantages of penetrating the BBB and acidic environment-induced in situ FIN56 release. Moreover, GFR nanoplatforms induced GBM cell ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 expression, and 808 nm irradiation reinforced GFR-mediated ferroptosis by elevating the temperature and promoting FIN56 release from GFR. In addition, the GFR nanoplatforms were inclined to locate in tumor tissue, inhibit GBM growth, and prolong lifespan by inducing GPX4-mediated ferroptosis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of GBM; meanwhile, 808 nm irradiation further improved these GFR-mediated effects. Hence, GFR may be a potential nanomedicine for cancer therapy, and GFR combined with photothermal therapy may be a promising strategy against GBM.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244298

Patients and methods: Seventy patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated at our department between 1996 and 2004 were studied. The male-female ratio was 2.6:1. The median age was 53 (16-74). Sixty-eight patients (97%) were operated on before radiotherapy and 2 patients (3%) underwent only stereotactic biopsy. All patients received radiotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy as an adjuvant to radiotherapy was given to 9 patients (12%). The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their age (group A < or = 35 years, n = 21 vs group B > 35 years, n = 49). Survival was determined with the Kaplan-Meier method and differences were compared using the log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the independent prognostic factors. Karnofsky performance status (> or = 70 vs < 70), age (< or = 35 vs > 35 years), gender, tumor size (< or = 4 vs > 4 cm), number of involved brain lobes (1 vs more than 1), type of surgery (total vs subtotal), preoperative seizure history (present vs absent), radiotherapy field (total cranium vs partial), total radiotherapy dose (60 vs 66 Gy), and adjuvant chemotherapy (present vs absent) were evaluated in univariate analysis. Results: The median survival was 10.3 months in the whole group, 19.5 months in the younger age group and 5.7 months in the older age group. During follow-up re-craniotomy was performed in 2 patients (3%), and 1 patient (1%) developed spinal seeding metastases and was given spinal radiotherapy. In univariate analysis younger age vs older age: median 19.5 months vs 5.27 months (P = 0.0012); Karnofsky performance status > or = 70 vs < 70: median 15.3 months vs 2.67 months (P < 0.0001), and external radiotherapy dose 60 Gy vs 66 Gy: median 11.6 months vs 3 months (P = 0.02) were found as significant prognostic factors for survival. In regression analysis a worse performance status (KPS <70) was found to be the only independent factor for survival (P = 0.014, 95% CI HR = 0.0043 [0.0001-0.15]). Conclusions: Younger patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme had a relatively long survival (median, 19.5 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 30%) compared to older patients.

Viability and apoptosis assays were performed in treated immortalized and patient-derived GBM cells, and post-mitotic neurons. IMT was delivered alone and with temozolomide, or gene silencing of the tumor-promoting chaperone, heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27). Results: GBM cells, but not neurons, exhibited >40% loss of viability, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis with IMT. Cell death was modest with temozolomide alone (30%) but increased significantly with concomitant IMT (70%).

We describe here identification of a novel homing peptide that recognizes tumor vessels and invasive tumor satellites in glioblastomas. We demonstrate successful brain tumor imaging using radiolabeled peptide in whole-body SPECT/CT imaging. Peptide-targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics prolonged the lifespan of mice bearing invasive brain tumors and significantly reduced the number of tumor satellites compared with the free drug. Moreover, we identified mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/H-FABP/FABP3) as the interacting partner for our peptide on brain tumor tissue. MDGI was expressed in human brain tumor specimens in a grade-dependent manner and its expression positively correlated with the histologic grade of the tumor, suggesting MDGI as a novel marker for malignant gliomas.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493698

An indwelling balloon catheter was implanted during the closing phase of the initial operation. Starting on the second or third postoperative day the catheter was afterloaded with a high dose rate isotope via a remotely controlled afterloading system. The treatment consisted of 10-12 fractions over a period of 5-6 days, with each treatment session requiring approximately 15 minutes. No external beam radiation was given. Forty-four newly diagnosed patients were treated. A total dose of either 60 Gy (33 patients) or 72 Gy (11 patients) was given. The overall median survival was 11.7 months, (range 2.7-50.9). The treatment was well tolerated and none of the applicators were removed prematurely. The total median hospital stay for this group of patients was significantly reduced compared to more conventional protocols.

Though there is an ongoing debate whether it can be considered an appropriate surrogate endpoint for overall survival in clinical trials, progression-free survival (PFS) is routinely used for clinical decision-making. Objective: To investigate whether machine learning (ML)-based models can reliably stratify newly diagnosed GBM patients into prognostic subclasses on PFS basis, identifying those at higher risk for an early recurrence (≤6 mo). Methods: Data were extracted from a multicentric database, according to the following eligibility criteria: histopathologically verified GBM and follow-up >12 mo: 474 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Relevant demographic, clinical, molecular, and radiological variables were selected by a feature selection algorithm (Boruta) and used to build a ML-based model. Results: Random forest prediction model, evaluated on an 80:20 split ratio, achieved an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77; 0.83) demonstrating high discriminative ability. Optimizing the predictive value derived from the linear and nonlinear combinations of the selected input features, our model outperformed across all performance metrics multivariable logistic regression.

Since the development of diagnostic radiology, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain tumors have been easier to demonstrate and can be found at earlier stages than in the conventional situation. Furthermore, highly technical devices and equipment for radiation therapy have been developed and installed for clinical use, especially with multileaf collimator (MLC) and treatment planning systems. In the field of radiotherapy for brain tumors, it has been possible to use more precise treatment planning with conformal radiotherapy, three-dimensional treatment planning, and stereotactic radiotherapy. Dose escalation studies and the modified fractionation schedule of radiotherapy can also be designed by analyzing biological data and applying hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to radioresistant tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. Future investigation may be useful to determine which fraction size is likely to be optimal for these malignant gliomas when highly conformal radiotherapy is used in adjuvant treatment.

While efficacious therapeutics, such as emerging chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and chemotherapeutics, have been developed to treat various cancers, their effectiveness in GBM treatment has been hindered largely by the blood-brain barrier and blood-brain-tumor barriers. Human neutrophils effectively cross physiological barriers and display effector immunity against pathogens but the short lifespan and resistance to genome editing of primary neutrophils have limited their broad application in immunotherapy. Here we genetically engineer human pluripotent stem cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in to express various anti-GBM CAR constructs with T-specific CD3ζ or neutrophil-specific γ-signaling domains. CAR-neutrophils with the best anti-tumor activity are produced to specifically and noninvasively deliver and release tumor microenvironment-responsive nanodrugs to target GBM without the need to induce additional inflammation at the tumor sites. This combinatory chemo-immunotherapy exhibits superior and specific anti-GBM activities, reduces off-target drug delivery and prolongs lifespan in female tumor-bearing mice. Together, this biomimetic CAR-neutrophil drug delivery system is a safe, potent and versatile platform for treating GBM and possibly other devastating diseases.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37080958
"""Extent of resection of glioblastoma revisited: personalized survival modeling facilitates more accurate survival prediction and supports a maximum-safe-resection approach to surgery.""","""Purpose: Approximately 12,000 glioblastomas are diagnosed annually in the United States. The median survival rate for this disease is 12 months, but individual survival rates can vary with patient-specific factors, including extent of surgical resection (EOR). The goal of our investigation is to develop a reliable strategy for personalized survival prediction and for quantifying the relationship between survival, EOR, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and methods: We used accelerated failure time (AFT) modeling using data from 721 newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma (from 1993 to 2010) to model the factors affecting individualized survival after surgical resection, and we used the model to construct probabilistic, patient-specific tools for survival prediction. We validated this model with independent data from 109 patients from a second institution. Results: AFT modeling using age, Karnofsky performance score, EOR, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy produced a continuous, nonlinear, multivariable survival model for glioblastoma. The median personalized predictive error was 4.37 months, representing a more than 20% improvement over current methods. Subsequent model-based calculations yield patient-specific predictions of the incremental effects of EOR and adjuvant therapy on survival. Conclusion: Nonlinear, multivariable AFT modeling outperforms current methods for estimating individual survival after glioblastoma resection. The model produces personalized survival curves and quantifies the relationship between variables modulating patient-specific survival. This approach provides comprehensive, personalized, probabilistic, and clinically relevant information regarding the anticipated course of disease, the overall prognosis, and the patient-specific influence of EOR and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The continuous, nonlinear relationship identified between expected median survival and EOR argues against a surgical management strategy based on rigid EOR thresholds and instead provides the first explicit evidence supporting a maximum safe resection approach to glioblastoma surgery.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24516010

Methods and materials: A total of 2,836 patients more than 70 years of age diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1993 and 2005 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Demographic and clinical variables used in the analysis included gender, ethnicity, tumor size, age at diagnosis, surgery, and radiotherapy. Cancer-specific survival and overall survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using Cox regression. Results: Radiotherapy was administered in 64% of these patients, and surgery was performed in 68%. Among 2,836 patients, 46% received surgery and radiotherapy, 22% underwent surgery only, 18% underwent radiotherapy only, and 14% did not undergo either treatment. The median survival for patients who underwent surgery and radiotherapy was 8 months. The median survival for patients who underwent radiotherapy only was 4 months, and for patients who underwent surgery only was 3 months.

Each case was first contoured using only MRI sequences (MRI-only), and then re-contoured with the addition of a fused planning CT (CT-MRI). The level of agreement among all contours was assessed using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) with the kappa statistic and Dice similarity coefficient. Results: A high level of agreement was observed between the GTV and CTV contours in the MRI-only workflow with a mean kappa of 0.88 and 0.89, respectively, with no statistically significant differences compared to the CT-MRI workflow (p = 0.88 and p = 0.82 for GTV and CTV, respectively). Agreement in cochlea contours improved from a mean kappa of 0.39 to 0.41, to 0.69 to 0.71 with the addition of CT information (p < 0.0001 for both cochleae).

Initial clinical trials show promising outcomes for SDT treatments of GBM. A crucial aspect of SDT is the sonosensitizer that interacts with ultrasound, facilitating energy transfer to the tumor, thus inducing therapeutic efficacy. Current in vitro methods for determining the therapeutic efficacies of sonosensitizers are time-consuming and expensive. A novel high-throughput magnetically printed 3D GBM model is used to overcome this challenge.

Ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation may be a potential adjuvant treatment that could theoretically be delivered locally by implantable micro-electromechanical systems that sense and kill early recurrence and/or minimally residual cancer. in vitro irradiation experiments are limited because they commonly use a single cell line. Therefore other methods are required to investigate cytotoxicity across a heterogeneous population of GBM. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the cytotoxic effects of UVC radiation on human GBM cell lines, with or without genetic modification, in monolayer to simulate a heterogeneous model. 16 publications were included using 14 different cell lines and 19 gene vectors. Effect sizes were calculated for cell survival, viability, apoptosis and proliferation. Univariate meta-regression was used to investigate the effects of radiant exposure (J/m2) and timing on cytotoxicity. Results: UVC resulted in a 70.9% (CI: 63.6%-78.2%) reduction in survival, 16.6% (CI: 10.8%-22.4%) increase in apoptosis, 32.0% (CI: 9.95%-54.2%) reduction in viability, and 413.8% (CI: 95.7%-731.9%) reduction in proliferation of GBM cell lines compared to controls.

"""Growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo.""","""Background: Glioblastomas are primary malignant brain tumors with a dismal prognosis. Knowledge of growth rates and underlying growth dynamics is useful for understanding basic tumor biology, developing realistic tumor models, and planning treatment logistics. Methods: By using repeated pretreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from 106 patients (aged 26-83 years), we studied the growth dynamics of untreated glioblastomas in vivo. Growth rates were calculated as specific growth rates and equivalent volume doubling times. The fit of different possible growth models was assessed using maximum likelihood estimations. Results: There were large variations in growth rates between patients. The median specific growth rate of the tumors was 1.4% per day, and the equivalent volume doubling time was 49.6 days. Exploring 3 different tumor growth models showed similar statistical fit for a Gompertzian growth model and a linear radial growth model and worse fit for an exponential growth model. However, large tumors had significantly lower growth rates than smaller tumors, supporting the assumption that glioblastomas reach a plateau phase and thus exhibit Gompertzian growth. Conclusion: Based on the fast growth rate of glioblastoma shown in this study, it is evident that poor treatment logistics will influence tumor size before surgery and can cause significant regrowth before adjuvant treatment. Since there is a known association between tumor volume, extent of surgical resection, and response to adjuvant therapy, it is likely that waiting times play a role in patient outcomes.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25758748

"""Targeted Therapies for the Treatment of Glioblastoma in Adults.""","""Purpose of review: Targeted therapies are part of biomarker-driven strategies that exploit actionable molecular targets and have gained traction following survival benefits demonstrated in various systemic malignancies. In glioblastoma, where therapeutic options remain scarce and prognosis poor, targeted therapies offer an attractive treatment alternative and are actively examined in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the targeted therapies, including traditional small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies as well as immunotherapeutic approaches that are examined in clinical trials, and discuss the challenges of using them for the treatment of glioblastoma. Recent findings: Despite initial speculations, phase II/III trials of targeted therapies in adult patients with glioblastoma have largely failed. Recent trials have focused on improving patient stratification, drug-tissue penetration, and target and compensatory pathway inhibition to optimize treatment response. In contrast to traditional small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies, cancer immunotherapy may target specific molecular or immune checkpoint target(s) to trigger immune responses against glioblastoma. Early phase clinical trials of immunotherapy have shown encouraging results, and larger randomized trials are ongoing. Targeted therapies are being actively studied in clinical trials. Patients with glioblastoma should be prioritized for clinical trial participation.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102038
"""[Radiotherapy of glioblastoma].""","""Glioblastoma cells appear to be inherently radioresistant and to present a significant fraction of hypoxic cells. The most significant prognostic factors to compare results achieved in several series of patients are the age, performance status and quality of surgical resection. Several randomized trials have provided evidence supporting the efficacy of radiation therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Prescription of a 60-Gy dose delivered according to a conventional dose-fractionation scheme (single daily fractions of 1.7 to 2 Gy five times per week) in a target volume with a 2-3 cm margin of tissue surrounding the perimeter of the contrast enhancing lesion on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is derived from observations made in several retrospective and prospective studies. Evidence of improvement in survival was observed neither in patients receiving hyperfractioned and accelerated radiotherapy, nor in patients for whom radiation sensitizers such as nitroimidazole compounds or halogenated pyrimidine analogs were associated to radiation therapy. The addition of nitrosourea to radiotherapy increases the 2-year survival rate by about 10%. Combination of full-dose external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy or radiosurgery boost in selected patients with glioblastoma leads to an increase in the median survival, while external beam radiation alone in patients with similar prognosis does not.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9295873

Methods and materials: One hundred four of 108 patients accrued from June 1994 through May 1995 from 26 institutions were analyzable. Patients were histologically confirmed with GBM, and previously untreated. Treatment assignment (52 patients/arm) was based on tumor mass (TM), defined as the product of the maximum diameter and greatest perpendicular dimension of the titanium-gadolinium-enhanced postoperative MRI: Arm A, 64 Gy, TM > 20 cm(2); or Arm B, 70.4 Gy, TM < or = 20 cm(2). Both Arms A and B received BCNU (80 mg/m(2), under hyperhydration) days 1-3, 56-58, then 4 cycles, each 8 weeks, for a total of 6 treatment series. Results: During the 24 months immediately post-treatment, the overall median survival was 9.1 months in Arm A (64 Gy) and 11.0 months in Arm B (70.4 Gy). Median survival in recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) Class III/IV was 10.4 months in Arm A and 12.2 months in Arm B, while RPA Class V/VI was 7.6 months in Arm A and 6.1 months in Arm B. There were no grade 4 neurological toxicities in Arm A; 2 grade 4 neurological toxicities were observed in Arm B (1 motor deficit, 1 necrosis at 157 days post-treatment). Conclusion: This strategy of high-dose, accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy shortens overall RT treatment times while allowing dose escalation, and it provides the potential for combination with currently available, as well as newer, chemotherapy agents.

Blocking adrenomedullin produced by hypoxia-TAMs restores vascular integrity, increases drug deliveryinto tumors, and provides combinatorial therapeutic benefits. Here we discuss the heterogeneity of TAMs regarding functional states and locations in glioblastomas, and propose future directions for studying the temporospatial dynamics of multifaceted TAM.

Several studies have pointed out age as an important negative factor for the outcome of elderly patients affected by glioblastoma multiforme. Elderly patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme are thus generally excluded from clinical trials of treatment for the neoplasm, because it is a common opinion that the prognosis for such patients is particularly poor.

"""Anticancer drug-loaded hydrogels as drug delivery systems for the local treatment of glioblastoma.""","""Among central nervous system tumors, Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common, aggressive and neurological destructive primary brain tumor in adults. Standard care therapy for GBM consists in surgical resection of the accessible tumor (without causing neurological damage) followed by chemoradiation. However, several obstacles limit the assessment of tumor response and the delivery of cytotoxic agents at the tumor site, leading to a lack of effectiveness of conventional treatments against GBM and fatal outcome. Despite the efforts of the scientific community to increase the long-term benefits of GBM therapy, at the moment GBM remains incurable. Among the strategies that have been adopted in the last two decades to find new and efficacious therapies for the treatment of GBM, the local delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in the tumor resection cavity emerged. In this review, our aim is to provide an overview on hydrogels loaded with anticancer drugs for the treatment of GBM recently used in preclinical and clinical studies, their advantages and major limitations for clinical translation. This review is divided in three parts: the first one describes the context of GBM and its current treatments, with a highlight on the role of local delivery in GBM treatment and the development of GBM resection murine models.

"""Neutron Capture Enhances Dose and Reduces Cancer Cell Viability in and out of Beam During Helium and Carbon Ion Therapy.""","""Purpose: Neutron capture enhanced particle therapy (NCEPT) is a proposed augmentation of charged particle therapy that exploits thermal neutrons generated internally, within the treatment volume via nuclear fragmentation, to deliver a biochemically targeted radiation dose to cancer cells. This work is the first experimental demonstration of NCEPT, performed using both carbon and helium ion beams with 2 different targeted neutron capture agents (NCAs). Methods and materials: Human glioblastoma cells (T98G) were irradiated by carbon and helium ion beams in the presence of NCAs [10B]-BPA and [157Gd]-DOTA-TPP. Cells were positioned within a polymethyl methacrylate phantom either laterally adjacent to or within a 100 × 100 × 60 mm spread out Bragg peak (SOBP). The effect of NCAs and location relative to the SOBP on the cells was measured by cell growth and survival assays in 6 independent experiments. Neutron fluence within the phantom was characterized by quantifying the neutron activation of gold foil. Results: Cells placed inside the treatment volume reached 10% survival by 2 Gy of carbon or 2 to 3 Gy of helium in the presence of NCAs compared with 5 Gy of carbon and 7 Gy of helium with no NCA. Cells placed adjacent to the treatment volume showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell growth when treated with NCAs, reaching 10% survival by 6 Gy of carbon or helium (to the treatment volume), compared with no detectable effect on cells without NCA. The mean thermal neutron fluence at the center of the SOBP was approximately 2.2 × 109 n/cm2/Gy (relative biological effectiveness) for the carbon beam and 5.8 × 109 n/cm2/Gy (relative biological effectiveness) for the helium beam and gradually decreased in all directions. Conclusions: The addition of NCAs to cancer cells during carbon and helium beam irradiation has a measurable effect on cell survival and growth in vitro. Through the capture of internally generated neutrons, NCEPT introduces the concept of a biochemically targeted radiation dose to charged particle therapy. NCEPT enables the established pharmaceuticals and concepts of neutron capture therapy to be applied to a wider range of deeply situated and diffuse tumors, by targeting this dose to microinfiltrates and cells outside of defined treatment regions. These results also demonstrate the potential for NCEPT to provide an increased dose to tumor tissue within the treatment volume, with a reduction in radiation doses to off-target tissue.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38479560

Subjects and method: This retrospective study was carried out by reviewing the medical records of 223 adult patients diagnosed at a tertiary academic hospital between 1990 and 2008. Patients' follow up ranged from 1 to 69 months (median 11 months). Surgery was attempted in all patients in whom complete resection in 15 patients (7%), subtotal resection in 77 patients (34%), partial resection in 73 patients (33%) and biopsy alone in 58 patients (26%) were done. In addition, we performed a literature review of PubMed to find out and analyze major related series. In all, we collected and analyzed the data of 33 major series including more than 11,000 patients with GBM. Results: There were 141 men and 82 women. The median progression free- and overall survival were 6 (95% CI=5.711-8.289) and 11 (95% CI=9.304-12.696) months respectively.

"""Stemness, invasion, and immunosuppression modulation in recurrent glioblastoma using nanotherapy.""","""The recurrent nature of glioblastoma negatively impacts conventional treatment strategies leading to a growing need for nanomedicine. Nanotherapeutics, an approach designed to deliver drugs to specific sites, is experiencing rapid growth and gaining immense popularity. Having potential in reaching the hard-to-reach disease sites, this field has the potential to show high efficacy in combatting glioblastoma progression. The presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) is a major factor behind the poor prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Stemness potential, heterogeneity, and self-renewal capacity, are some of the properties that make GSCs invade across the distant regions of the brain. Despite advances in medical technology and MRI-guided maximal surgical resection, not all GSCs residing in the brain can be removed, leading to recurrent disease. The aggressiveness of GBM is often correlated with immune suppression, where the T-cells are unable to infiltrate the cancer initiating GSCs. Standard of care therapies, including surgery and chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy, have failed to tackle all the challenges of the GSCs, making it increasingly important for researchers to develop strategies to tackle their growth and proliferation and reduce the recurrence of GBM.

Survival probabilities were 57% at 1 year, 16% at 2 years, and 7% at 3 years. Progression-free survival was 15% at 1 year. Prolongation of survival was significantly associated with surgery in patients with a good performance status, whatever the patient's age, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.55 (p < 0.001) or a 45% relative decrease in the risk of death. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy improved survival, with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.61 (p = 0.001) and 0.89 (p = 0.04), respectively, regardless of age, performance status, or residual tumor volume. Recurrence occurred in 99% of patients throughout the follow-up.

Our previous studies showed that honokiol, a major bioactive constituent of Magnolia officinalis (Houpo), can kill human glioblastoma cells and suppresses glioblastoma growth. This study was further aimed to evaluate the effects of honokiol on human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells and the possible mechanisms. The results by data mining in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and immunohistochemistry displayed that expression of caspase-9 mRNA and protein in human glioblastomas was induced. Human TMZ-resistant U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells were selected and prepared from human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells. Compared to human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells, TMZ did not affect viability of U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells. Interestingly, treatment with honokiol suppressed proliferation and survival of human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Compared to caspase-8 activation, honokiol chiefly increased activity of caspase-9 in U87-MG-R9 cells. Successively, levels of cleaved caspase-3 and activities of caspase-3 and caspase-6 in human TMZ-tolerant glioblastoma cells were augmented following honokiol administration. In parallel, honokiol triggered DNA fragmentation of U87-MG-R9 cells. Accordingly, treatment of human TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells with honokiol induced cell apoptosis but did not affect cell necrosis. Fascinatingly, suppressing caspase-9 activity using its specific inhibitors repressed honokiol-induced caspase-6 activation, DNA fragmentation, and cell apoptosis. Taken together, this study has shown the major roles of caspase-9 in transducing honokiol-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells.

Methods: The study includes 132 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients treated between 2013 and 2017 with open resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and maintenance temozolomide. Patients were dichotomized into a non-elderly (< 65 years) and an elderly (≥ 65 years) group.

Clinical and radiological follow-up data were obtained at 6 weeks after the end of radiation therapy and thereafter in 3-month intervals. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses. Results: The elderly group consisted of 58 patients (median age: 70.5 years) and the non-elderly group of 74 patients (median age: 55 years). Median pre- and postoperative operative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score and National Institutes of Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were not significantly different between the groups, but KPS and ECOG scores became significantly worse in the elderly group at 6 weeks after termination of radiation therapy. Neither PFS nor OS differed significantly between the age groups. Patients with MGMT promoter-methylated tumours survived longer. Conclusion: Elderly patients in good pre- and postoperative clinical conditions may show similar outcome as younger patients when treated according to standard of care.

"""Exploring the Physical and Biological Aspects of BNCT with a Carboranylmethylbenzo[b]acridone Compound in U87 Glioblastoma Cells.""","""Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a re-emerging technique for selectively killing tumor cells. Briefly, the mechanism can be described as follows: after the uptake of boron into cells, the thermal neutrons trigger the fission of the boron atoms, releasing the α-particles and recoiling lithium particles and high-energy photons that damage the cells. We performed a detailed study of the reactor dosimetry, cellular dose assessment, and radiobiological effects induced by BNCT in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. At maximum reactor power, neutron fluence rates were ϕ0 = 6.6 × 107 cm−2 s−1 (thermal) and θ = 2.4 × 104 cm−2 s−1 with a photon dose rate of 150 mGy·h−1. These values agreed with simulations to within 85% (thermal neutrons), 78% (epithermal neutrons), and 95% (photons), thereby validating the MCNPX model. The GEANT4 simulations, based on a realistic cell model and measured boron concentrations, showed that >95% of the dose in cells was due to the BNC reaction. Carboranylmethylbenzo[b]acridone (CMBA) is among the different proposed boron delivery agents that has shown promising properties due to its lower toxicity and important cellular uptake in U87 glioblastoma cells. In particular, the results obtained for CBMA reinforce radiobiological effects demonstrating that damage is mostly induced by the incorporated boron with negligible contribution from the culture medium and adjacent cells, evidencing extranuclear cell radiosensitivity.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36499256

We analyzed prognosis factors in patients with grade IV glioblastoma treated between 1993 and 1997. The 22 long-term survival patients (survival over 26 months) were extracted from our 30 years archives and the 2 populations are compared. The incidence was 2.6/100,000h/year, 62% male and 38% female, mean age 59 years, mean survival 12 months, median survival time 9 months. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, surgical treatment and radiotherapy were all dependent prognosis factors for better survival. Statistically, survival was best for total surgical removal of tumors, followed by tumor gross resection then biopsy. Clinical status and inextirpable tumor location were also prognosis factors. The free interval time between total surgery and tumor reappearance was strongly correlated with survival (r=0.94). This suggests that some grade IV gliomas follow a quicker course, others exhibiting slow growth. Each of the prognosis factors was confirmed in the long-survival patients. Prevalence of all glioblastomes was 4.3%. Their mean age was 42 and mean survival 62 months. A larger proportion of these patients had total surgery and radiotherapy. The time lapse before tumor reappearance was longer. Deep tumor locations were less frequent. The proportion of secondary versus primary glioblastomas was the greatest difference between the long-term and regular survivors. Secondary glioblastomas were found in only 4% of the standard population and in 23 to 41% in the long-term survivors (p<0.01). Primary glioblastomas typically show EGFR over expression and mutation (variant III). The pathway to secondary glioblastoma involves early P53 mutation.

We hypothesized that the permeability surface area product (PS) from a perfusion computed tomography (PCT) study is associated with sensitivity to TMZ. The aim of this study was to determine whether PS values were correlated with prognosis of GBM patients who received the standard treatment protocol. Methods: This study included 36 patients with GBM that were newly diagnosed between October 2005 and September 2014 and who underwent preoperative PCT study and the standard treatment protocol. We measured the maximum value of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBVmax) and the maximum PS value (PSmax). We statistically examined the relationship between PSmax and prognosis using survival analysis, including other clinicopathologic factors (age, Karnofsky performance status [KPS], extent of resection, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] status, second-line use of bevacizumab, and rCBVmax). Results: Log-rank tests revealed that age, KPS, MGMT status, and PSmax were significantly correlated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model showed that PSmax was the most significant prognostic factor. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that PSmax had the highest accuracy in differentiating longtime survivors (LTSs) (surviving more than 2 years) from non-LTSs. At a cutoff point of 8.26 mL/100 g/min, sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 70%, respectively. Conclusions: PSmax from PCT study can help predict survival time in patients with GBM receiving the standard treatment protocol.

Preclinical studies suggest TTFields and radiation treatment have synergistic effects. We report our initial experience evaluating toxicity and tolerability of scalp-sparing radiation with concurrent TTFields. Methods: This is a single arm pilot study (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03477110). Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with KPS ≥ 60 with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were eligible. All patients received concurrent scalp-sparing radiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions), standard concurrent temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily), and TTFields. Maintenance therapy included standard temozolomide and continuation of TTFields. Radiation treatment was delivered through TTFields arrays. The primary endpoint was safety and toxicity for concurrent TTFields with chemoradiation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Results: We report the first ten patients on the trial. Eight were male, and two were female, with median age 61 years (range 49 to 73 years). Median KPS was 90 (range 70-90). Median follow-up was 7.9 months (2.8 to 17.9 months). Nine (90%) patients with unmethylated MGMT promotor, and one with methylated. Median time from surgery to radiation was 33 days (28 to 49 days). All patients completed concurrent chemoradiation plus TTFields without radiation or TTFields treatment interruption or discontinuation. Scalp dose constraints were achieved for all patients, with mean dose having a median value of 7.7 Gy (range 4.9 to 13.2 Gy), D20cc median 22.6 Gy (17.7 to 36.8 Gy), and D30cc median 19.8 Gy (14.8 to 33.4 Gy). Average daily use during concurrent phase had median value of 83.5% and 77% for maintenance. There was no related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity. Skin toxicity (erythema, dermatitis, pruritus) was noted in 80% of patients, however, these were limited to Grade 1 or 2 events which resolved spontaneously or responded to topical medications. Eight patients (80%) had progression, with median PFS of 6.9 months (range 2.8 to 9.6 months).

The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reveals intricate functional interplays between glioblastoma and the cellular architecture of the brain, encompassing neurons, glia, and vessels. New findings underscore the role of structural and functional connections within hierarchical networks, known as the connectome. These connections contribute to the location, spread, and recurrence of a glioblastoma, and a patient's overall survival, revealing a complex interplay between the tumour and the CNS. This mounting evidence prompts a paradigm shift, challenging the perception of glioblastomas as mere foreign bodies within the brain. Instead, these tumours are intricately woven into the structural and functional fabric of the brain.

High heterogeneity in the tumor cell population and the invasive nature of these cells decrease the likely efficacy of traditional cancer treatments, thus requiring research into novel treatment options. The use of oncolytic viruses as potential therapeutics has been researched for some time. Zika virus (ZIKV) has demonstrated oncotropism and oncolytic effects on GBM stem cells (GSCs). To address the need for safe and effective GBM treatments, we designed an attenuated ZIKV strain (ZOL-1) that does not cause paralytic or neurological diseases in mouse models compared with unmodified ZIKV. Importantly, we found that patient-derived GBM tumors exhibited susceptibility (responders) and non-susceptibility (non-responders) to ZOL-1-mediated tumor cell killing, as evidenced by differential apoptotic cell death and cell viability upon ZOL-1 treatment. The oncolytic effect observed in responder cells was seen both in vitro in neurosphere models and in vivo upon xenograft. Finally, we observed that the use of ZOL-1 as combination therapy with multiple PI3K-AKT inhibitors in non-responder GBM resulted in enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy. Altogether, this study establishes ZOL-1 as a safe and effective treatment against GBM and provides a foundation to conduct further studies evaluating its potential as an effective adjuvant with other chemotherapies and kinase inhibitors.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37830597

"""Malignant transformation of a conservatively managed incidental childhood cerebral mass lesion: controversy regarding management paradigm.""","""Background: Incidental findings on neuroimaging in the pediatric population are an emerging treatment challenge. Treatment options for these incidental childhood brain mass lesions, which radiologically may be assumed to be low-grade gliomas (LGG), vary, ranging from careful conservative 'wait and scan' treatment to surgical biopsy, gross total resection, and upfront radiation and/or chemotherapy. As malignant transformation of LGG in children is extremely rare, some series advocate careful conservative management of these lesions; however, universal treatment protocols are not totally agreed upon. Illustrative case: We present the case of a 10-year-old boy with a fronto-basal incidental cerebral mass lesion, suspected to be a low-grade glial neoplasm. Initially, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done to rule out a pathology causing his growth to be delayed. A treatment with growth hormone was initiated. After close clinical and radiological follow-up of this asymptomatic lesion for 6 years, a minimal growth of the lesion was seen, which we decided to continue following. After 7 years, a clear growth with new contrast enhancement was seen on routine MRI. At this point, the lesion was surgically resected. The diagnosis was, surprisingly, glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV, BRAF V-600E mutation). Discussion: Malignant transformation of LGGs in children is a very rare phenomenon. This is to our knowledge the first well-documented case describing malignant transformation of a suspected benign pediatric cerebral mass lesion, which did not undergo radiation, in a patient without a cancer predisposition syndrome (e.g., neurofibromatosis), with the transformation occurring after such a long follow-up period. The management of these lesions is still controversial. Unfortunately, radiological risk factors for malignant transformation of such lesions in the pediatric age group are lacking. Conclusion: Conservative treatment of incidental cerebral mass lesions in children seems a valid option. These lesions should probably be followed indefinitely, while carefully watching for changes in imaging characteristics.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28808787

The primary objective was OS, and secondary objectives included PFS, response rate, and treatment adverse events (AEs) including delayed CNS toxicities. Methods: NRG Oncology/RTOG1205 is a prospective, phase II, randomized trial of re-RT and BEV versus BEV alone. Stratification factors included age, resection, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Patients with recurrent GBM with imaging evidence of tumor progression ≥ 6 months from completion of prior chemo-RT were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to re-RT, 35 Gy in 10 fractions, with concurrent BEV IV 10 mg/kg once in every 2 weeks or BEV alone until progression. Results: From December 2012 to April 2016, 182 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 170 were eligible. Patient characteristics were well balanced between arms. The median follow-up for censored patients was 12.8 months. There was no improvement in OS for BEV + RT, hazard ratio, 0.98; 80% CI, 0.79 to 1.23; P = .46; the median survival time was 10.1 versus 9.7 months for BEV + RT versus BEV alone. The median PFS for BEV + RT was 7.1 versus 3.8 months for BEV, hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.0; P = .05. The 6-month PFS rate improved from 29.1% (95% CI, 19.1 to 39.1) for BEV to 54.3% (95% CI, 43.5 to 65.1) for BEV + RT, P = .001. Treatment was well tolerated.

"""Treatment of elderly patients with glioblastoma: from clinical evidence to molecular highlights.""","""Elderly patients with glioblastoma are characterized by a high rate of associated morbidities, and a poor prognosis. Therefore, they have been excluded from most prospective clinical trials. However, the poorer outcome retrospectively reported in these patients might be also related to that those are less likely to receive the appropriate treatment than their younger counterparts. We reviewed the literature with regard to the optimal therapeutic management of this particular population, with focus on molecular perspectives for improving patients' selection. Clinical data have demonstrated that open craniotomy with resection of the tumor was superior to biopsy only in elderly patients with good Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score. Then, postoperative radiotherapy (RT) improves survival without impairing functional status or neurocognitive functions, compared with best supportive care only following resection. Despite promising preliminary data, the addition of concomitant temozolomide to RT has not been validated in patients more than 70-years old. In case of additional poor prognostic factors or after biopsy only, there is no definitive demonstration that RT, chemotherapy, or both could improve outcome. Incorporation of more sensitive predictive and/or prognostic molecular factors could help physicians in patients' selection. Further prospective trials should incorporate age-dependent molecular specificities in their design, and better focus on particular subgroup of patients exhibiting specific molecular alterations.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22289687

In the present study, 302 glioblastoma specimens were studied to evaluate a possible association between clinical outcome and expression of some immunohistochemical variables. Furthermore, tumors examined were subdivided on the three cytological subsets--small-cell (SGB), pleomorphic-cell (PGB) and gemistocytic (GGB). Immunohistochemical variables differed between various subsets: the number of p53-positive tumors was found to be prevailed among the PGB, whereas the number of tumors with EGFR and mdm2 positivity was significantly greater in SGB. GGB contained significantly lowest mean proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index (LI), greater number of p21ras positive cases, and higher mean apoptotic index (AI). Survival time in patients with SGB, EGFR and mdm2-positivity and PCNA LI >40% was found to be significantly shorter, whereas presence of p21ras and AI >0.5% were associated with prolonged survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that survival time is associated with SGB, EGFR-positivity, and AI (p = 0.0023, p = 0.0035 and p = 0.0029 respectively). We conclude that although some immunohistochemical variables were found to be significant for glioblastoma outcome, they appear to be closely related to biology of single cytological subsets. Furthermore, these variables exhibited no prognostic value when they were analyzed within each cytological subset separately. Therefore, the glioblastoma subdivision on three cytological subsets proposed by us is carrying some element of rationality but, undoubtedly, requires further prospective studies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12187957

Drug and radiation treatments started on day 0 when tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm(3). Tumors were treated with 5 x 5 Gy (U87) or 6 x 5 Gy (A431) on consecutive days from day 0. Imatinib was administered orally via the mouse diet starting on day 0 until the end of observation. Tumor growth and microvessel density (CD31 IHC) were analyzed. Results: In vitro, imatinib increased radiosensitivity of U87 and A431 tumor cells as well as HUVECs in both clonogenic and cell number/proliferation assays. The enhancement of radiosensitivity in HUVECs was comparable to that observed in the tumor cells. In vivo, the concurrent and continuous administration of imatinib increased tumor growth delay of fractionated radiotherapy in the carcinoma and the glioblastoma models at reduced microvessel densities. No apparent additional toxicity by the combination of radiation and imatinib versus monotherapies was observed in terms of weight, skin, or general behavior. Conclusion: Imatinib (Gleevec), a 'molecular targeted' approved drug for human malignancies, can enhance the tumor growth reduction induced by fractionated radiotherapy in glioblastoma and carcinoma models. The data provides a rationale to further investigate the combination.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826359
"""Long-term treatment of malignant gliomas with intramuscularly administered polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose: an open pilot study.""","""Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) (10-50 mcg/kg, administered intramuscularly one to three times weekly) was given for < or = 56 months to 38 patients with malignant gliomas. There was minimal or no toxicity. Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease). All but one patient with anaplastic astrocytomas who received continuous poly-ICLC remain alive, with a median progression-free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. Median Kaplan-Meier survival is 19 months for patients with glioblastomas who receive at least twice weekly poly-ICLC treatments. Tumor response was associated with 2',5' -oligoadenylate synthetase activation (P = 0.03) but not with serum interferon. We hypothesize clinical activation by poly-ICLC of a basic host tumor suppressor system. Prolonged, quality survival with tumor stabilization or regression confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging for most patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas suggests that more extensive laboratory and controlled clinical studies are warranted. The concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with nontoxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as low-dose poly-ICLC, may be applicable to the treatment of other malignancies.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8727138

Histopathological investigation was performed by hematoxilyn-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD34, VEGF, VEGFR1/2, HIF-1α, CA9, and nestin as compared to eleven control glioblastomas to assess the differences in histological features, microvessel density, expression of VEGF and its receptors, tumor oxygenation, and status of glioma stem-like cells.In the six tumors resected under bevacizumab, microvascular proliferation was absent, and microvessel density had significantly decreased compared with that of the controls. The expressions of VEGF and its receptors were downregulated in two cases of partial response. HIF-1α or CA9 expression was decreased in five of the six tumors, whereas the decreased expression of these markers was noted in only one of the 11 control glioblastomas. The expression of nestin significantly decreased in the six tumors compared with that of the controls, with the remaining nestin-positive cells being relatively concentrated around vessels.We provide the first clinicopathological evidence that antiangiogenic therapy induces the apparent normalization of vascular structure, decrease of microvessel density, and improvement of tumor oxygenation in glioblastomas.

"""Short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy, incorporating (18)F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI targeting, for patients aged 65 years and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: a single-arm phase 2 trial.""","""Background: Older patients (aged ≥65 years) with glioblastoma have a worse prognosis than younger patients and a median overall survival of 6-9 months. 3,4-Dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET sensitively and specifically identifies metabolically active glioblastoma for preferential targeting. Proton beam therapy potentially improves quality of life (QOL) by sparing more healthy brain tissue than photon radiotherapy. With improved targeting and the dosimetric advantages of proton beam therapy, we aimed to test whether hypofractionated proton beam therapy could improve survival and QOL in older patients with glioblastoma. Methods: In this single-arm phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 65 years and older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2 and newly diagnosed WHO grade 4, malignant glioblastoma from two Mayo Clinic campuses (Phoenix, AZ, and Rochester, MN, USA). Radiotherapy target volumes were defined by 18F-DOPA PET and MRI regions of contrast enhancement. Patients were given dose-escalated hypofractionated proton beam therapy (35-40 Gy equivalents in five or ten treatments) plus oral concurrent temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily on days 1-7 for the five-treatment regimen or on days 1-14 for the ten-treatment regimen), and 1 month after completing radiotherapy patients were given adjuvant temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 on days 1-5 for six 28-day cycles). The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months after enrolment. The primary endpoint and safety were assessed in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all eligible patients who started radiotherapy). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03778294, and is now complete. Findings: Between May 22, 2019, and May 25, 2021, 43 patients were enrolled, of whom four did not receive treatment because of progression (n=2), death (n=1), or insurance denial (n=1), such that 39 patients received treatment (median age 70·2 years [IQR 67·4-74·3]; 11 [28%] of 39 patients were female, 28 [72%] were male, 37 [95%] were White, one [3%] was Black or African American, and one chose not to disclose their race). As of data cutoff (Jan 30, 2024), median follow-up was 25·4 months (IQR 22·1-29·7). 22 (56% [95% CI 39-72]) of 39 patients were alive at 12 months. Median overall survival was 13·1 months (95% CI 11·1-19·1). Grade 3 baseline-adjusted, treatment-associated adverse events were CNS necrosis (four [10%] of 39) and thrombocytopenia (one [3%]). No baseline-adjusted, treatment-associated grade 4 adverse events or deaths occurred. Interpretation: We observed improved overall survival compared with historical controls and a promising adverse event profile by using 18F-DOPA PET-guided, dose-escalated, hypofractionated proton beam therapy. These findings have resulted in the opening of a phase 2 study (NCT05781321) investigating this regimen versus standard-of-care treatment in adults of any age with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

"""Spectromicroscopy of boron in human glioblastomas following administration of Na2B12H11SH.""","""Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an experimental, binary treatment for brain cancer which requires as the first step that tumor tissue is targeted with a boron-10 containing compound. Subsequent exposure to a thermal neutron flux results in destructive, short range nuclear reaction within 10 microm of the boron compound. The success of the therapy requires than the BNCT agents be well localized in tumor, rather than healthy tissue. The MEPHISTO spectromicroscope, which performs microchemical analysis by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy from microscopic areas, has been used to study the distribution of trace quantities of boron in human brain cancer tissues surgically removed from patients first administered with the compound Na2B12H11SH (BSH). The interpretation of XANES spectra is complicated by interference from physiologically present sulfur and phosphorus, which contribute structure in the same energy range as boron. We addressed this problem with the present extensive set of spectra from S, B, and P in relevant compounds. We demonstrate that a linear combination of sulfate, phosphate and BSH XANES can be used to reproduce the spectra acquired on boron-treated human brain tumor tissues. We analyzed human glioblastoma tissue from two patients administered and one not administered with BSH. As well as weak signals attributed to BSH, x-ray absorption spectra acquired from tissue samples detected boron in a reduced chemical state with respect to boron in BSH. This chemical state was characterized by a sharp absorption peak at 188.3 eV. Complementary studies on BSH reference samples were not able to reproduce this chemical state of boron, indicating that it is not an artifact produced during sample preparation or x-ray exposure. These data demonstrate that the chemical state of BSH may be altered by in vivo metabolism.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11088567
"""Inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression in glioblastomas and their in vitro and in vivo targeting by SMAC mimetic GDC-0152.""","""Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most aggressive primary brain tumors in adult and remain a therapeutic challenge. Targeting key apoptosis regulators with the ultimate aim to restore apoptosis in tumor cells could be an interesting therapeutic strategy. The inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and represent attractive targets, especially because they can be antagonized by SMAC mimetics. In this study, we first investigated the expression of cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and ML-IAP in human GBM samples and in four different cell lines. We showed that all GBM samples and GBM cell lines expressed all these IAPs, although the expression of each IAP varied from one case to another. We then showed that high level of ML-IAP predicted worse progression-free survival and overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses in two independent cohorts of 58 and 43 primary human GBMs. We then used GDC-0152, a SMAC mimetic that antagonizes these IAPs and confirmed that GDC-0152 treatment in vitro decreased IAPs in all the cell lines studied. It affected cell line viability and triggered apoptosis, although the effect was higher in U87MG and GL261 than in GBM6 and GBM9 cell lines. In vivo, GDC-0152 effect on U87MG orthotopic xenografts was dose dependent; it postponed tumor formation and slowed down tumor growth, significantly improving survival of GBM-bearing mice. This study revealed for the first time that ML-IAP protein expression correlates with GBM patient survival and that its antagonist GDC-0152 improves outcome in xenografted mouse.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27490930

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases. We included studies that enrolled patients 15 years or older with a diagnosis of glioblastoma according to Louis criteria and focused on signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms present in tumor relapse of glioblastoma. The outcome of interest was progression-free survival. Results: We identified 1470 articles; 31 met the inclusion criteria.

As a result, the dismal overall survival of GBM patients has not changed over the past three decades. GBM has been stubbornly resistant to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, which have been remarkably effective in the treatment of other tumors. It is clear that GBM resistance to therapy is multifactorial. Although therapeutic transport into brain tumors is inhibited by the blood brain barrier, there is evolving evidence that overcoming this barrier is not the predominant factor. GBMs generally have a low mutation burden, exist in an immunosuppressed environment and they are inherently resistant to immune stimulation, all of which contribute to treatment resistance. In this review, we evaluate the contribution of multi-omic approaches (genomic and metabolomic) along with analyzing immune cell populations and tumor biophysical characteristics to better understand and overcome GBM multifactorial resistance to treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37330006

Additionally, we performed O6-methylguanin-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation analysis using real-time methylation-specific PCR in 36 patients with glioblastoma, and the prognostic significance of these biomarkers in glioblastomas was evaluated. Results: Overexpression of CD151 was observed in a significant proportion (55.6%) of glioblastomas, while CD151 was rarely overexpressed in most of grade I to III glial tumors. CD151 overexpression was closely associated with MGMT methylation (P = 0.014), and it was a prognostic factor for predicting worse overall survival (OS; P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.043). We also found that combination of CD151 overexpression and MGMT methylation better stratified the patients' OS (P = 0.001) and PFS (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, CD151 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS over MGMT methylation (P = 0.012).

In this scenario, the use of oncolytic viruses retargeted to glioblastoma cells and able to spread across the tumor cells represent an intriguing treatment strategy. Here, we tested the specificity, safety and efficacy of R-613, the first oncolytic HSV fully retargeted to EGFRvIII, a variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor carrying a mutation typically found in glioblastoma. An early treatment with R-613 on orthotopically transplanted EGFRvIII-expressing human glioblastoma significantly increased the median survival time of mice. In this setting, the growth of human glioblastoma xenotransplants was monitored by a secreted luciferase reporter and showed that R-613 is able to substantially delay the development of the tumor masses. When administered as late treatment to a well-established glioblastomas, R-613 appeared to be less effective. Notably the uninfected tumor cells derived from the explanted tumor masses were still susceptible to R-613 infection ex vivo, thus suggesting that multiple treatments could enhance R-613 therapeutic efficacy, making R-613 a promising oncolytic HSV candidate for glioblastoma treatment.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34578259

We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with histopathological diagnoses of glioblastoma (GBM) that were treated with SRS over a 16-year period (1991-2007). Twenty-two were treated as part of their initial treatment paradigm and 26 were treated at the time of progression. The primary endpoints studied were overall survival (OS), survival after SRS and time-to-progression (TTP). Patients treated at the time of progression had significantly longer OS than those treated on initial presentation (17.4 vs. 15.1 months, P = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) class III patients, those with more extensive resections, and those who were not on steroids at the time of SRS had significantly improved OS. SRS margin dose was a significant prognostic factor for TTP on multivariate analysis (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62-0.98). In the subgroup of patients treated with GKS as part of their initial treatment, an increasing number of weeks between surgical resection and GKS was a poor prognostic factor on multivariate analysis (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23). In patients who were treated with SRS at the time of progression, chemotherapy was associated with a longer TTP (P = 0.028). Our results suggest that SRS provides a survival advantage when delivered after RT. This benefit may be best appreciated in RTOG class III patients.

"""Exploring Novel Molecular Targets for the Treatment of High-Grade Astrocytomas Using Peptide Therapeutics: An Overview.""","""Diffuse astrocytomas are the most aggressive and lethal glial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Their high cellular heterogeneity and the presence of specific barriers, i.e., blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor barrier, make these cancers poorly responsive to all kinds of currently available therapies. Standard therapeutic approaches developed to prevent astrocytoma progression, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, do not improve the average survival of patients. However, the recent identification of key genetic alterations and molecular signatures specific for astrocytomas has allowed the advent of novel targeted therapies, potentially more efficient and characterized by fewer side effects. Among others, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic agents, due to their numerous advantages when compared to standard chemotherapeutics. They can be employed as (i) pharmacologically active agents, which promote the reduction of tumor growth; or (ii) carriers, either to facilitate the translocation of drugs through brain, tumor, and cellular barriers, or to target tumor-specific receptors. Since several pathways are normally altered in malignant gliomas, better outcomes may result from combining multi-target strategies rather than targeting a single effector.

"""The autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor cascade: proposal of a novel potential therapeutic target for treating glioblastoma multiforme.""","""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Its prognosis is one of the worst among all cancer types, and it is considered a fatal malignancy, incurable with conventional therapeutic strategies. As the bioactive multifunctional lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is well recognized to be involved in the tumorigenesis of cancers by acting on G-protein-coupled receptors, LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists and LPA synthesis inhibitors have been proposed as promising drugs for cancer treatment. Six LPARs, named LPA1-6, are currently recognized. Among them, LPA1 is the dominant LPAR in the CNS and is highly expressed in GBM in combination with the overexpression of autotaxin (ATX), the enzyme (a phosphodiesterase, which is a potent cell motility-stimulating factor) that produces LPA.Invasion is a defining hallmark of GBM. LPA is significantly related to cell adhesion, cell motility, and invasion through the Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac. LPA1 is responsible for LPA-driven cell motility, which is attenuated by LPA4. GBM is among the most vascular human tumors. Although anti-angiogenic therapy (through the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) was established, sufficient results have not been obtained because of the increased invasiveness triggered by anti-angiogenesis. As both ATX and LPA play a significant role in angiogenesis, similar to VEGF, inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis may be beneficial as a two-pronged therapy that includes anti-angiogenic and anti-invasion therapy. Conventional approaches to GBM are predominantly directed at cell proliferation. Recurrent tumors regrow from cells that have invaded brain tissues and are less proliferative, and are thus quite resistant to conventional drugs and radiation, which preferentially kill rapidly proliferating cells. A novel approach that targets this invasive subpopulation of GBM cells may improve the prognosis of GBM. Patients with GBM that contacts the subventricular zone (SVZ) have decreased survival. A putative source of GBM cells is the SVZ, the largest area of neurogenesis in the adult human brain. GBM stem cells in the SVZ that are positive for the neural stem cell surface antigen CD133 are highly tumorigenic and enriched in recurrent GBM. LPA1 expression appears to be increased in these cells. Here, the author reviews research on the ATX/LPAR axis, focusing on GBM and an ATX/LPAR-targeted approach.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26084470

Methods: An open-label, multi-institutional, dose-escalation phase I trial in rGBM subjects (NCT03636477) accrued 21 subjects in 3 dose-escalating cohorts: (1) neoadjuvant then ongoing nivolumab (1mg/kg) and VDX (10 mg) (n = 3); (2) neoadjuvant then ongoing nivolumab (3 mg/kg) and VDX (10 mg) (n = 3); and (3) neoadjuvant then ongoing nivolumab (3 mg/kg) and VDX (20 mg) (n = 15). Nivolumab was administered 7 (±3) days before resection of the rGBM followed by peritumoral injection of IL-12 gene therapy. VDX was administered 3 hours before and then for 14 days after surgery. Nivolumab was administered every two weeks after surgery. Results: Toxicities of the combination were comparable to IL-12 gene monotherapy and were predictable, dose-related, and reversible upon withholding doses of VDX and/or nivolumab. VDX plasma pharmacokinetics demonstrate a dose-response relationship with effective brain tumor tissue VDX penetration and production of IL-12. IL-12 levels in serum peaked in all subjects at about Day 3 after surgery. Tumor IFNγ increased in post-treatment biopsies. Median overall survival (mOS) for VDX 10 mg with nivolumab was 16.9 months and for all subjects was 9.8 months.
